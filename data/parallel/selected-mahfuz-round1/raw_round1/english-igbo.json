What started out as an experimental campaign soon blossomed into a carnival of art, birthing nearly 500 new illustrations.These wordless narratives cut across language barriers, opening up a world of possibilities, encouraging StoryWeaver\u2019s growing community to dream up multiple stories around these images.

People could finish their business in privacy and pour a\nbucket of water which would flush the waste down a drain. This way,\nthey managed to keep their houses and streets clean.", "The Indus Valley, situated in present day Pakistan and India, is one of the three oldest civilizations that we know of, the other two being Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. From what we can see of the ruins today, the people of Indus Valley had great building skills, were good at making metal and ceramic products, and planned their city-wide drainage systems very elaborately.", "Around the same time, similar toilet arrangements were present in\nother parts of the world. Homes in Egypt and Babylonia had toilets\nbuilt in, and the ruins in Skara Brae in Scotland and the Minoan\nCrete in the Mediterranean show plenty of pipes leading out of what\ndefinitely seems like a toilet inside a house.\u00a0\n\n\nA little later, about 2,000 years ago in Rome, people used public\ntoilets. A long slab of stone had keyhole-shaped cuts at intervals.\nPeople would sit on these openings and do their toilet business while\nhaving a friendly chat with the person next to them. I told you it\nwas a \u201cpublic\u201d toilet!", "How did they clean themselves, do you wonder? After I tell you, you\nmight wish you had never wondered. \n\n\n\nThey took a long stick that had a sponge attached to one end and\ndipped the sponge into water, and then used it to wipe their\nbacksides. After they felt clean, they simply handed the stick over\nto their neighbour, who dipped it in water and used it again. Let me\ngive you a friendly tip here \u2013 if you ever find yourself in this\nplace, make sure you pick the very first seat!", "Not everyone had to poop in public in Rome. If you were super-rich,\nyou would have a chamber pot at home into which you would do your\nbusiness. Once done, you would simply empty the contents onto the\nstreet outside. And if someone happened to walk by at the time, well,\ntoo bad for them!\n\nAbout 500 years ago, Queen Elizabeth of England had a toilet\nconstructed inside her house. It had a pipe leading out into a sewage\npit outside. But she never used it much because the stench from the\nsewer filled the toilet and she could not even breathe. So back to\nthe chamber pot she went.", "Toilets of the present\nToilets these days don\u2019t stink. How did they achieve that?\u00a0In 1775,\nthe English inventor Alexander Cumming figured out a way. Instead of\nusing a straight pipe to connect the toilet to the sewage line, he\nmade it S-shaped. This made sure that while poop and pee and water\ncan go \n\ndown\nthe drain, no\nsmell can come back up. Have you noticed that a little\nwater always stays in the toilet even after flushing? This is what\ncreates the \"seal\" and prevents the foul smell from entering the\nroom through the drain.", "", "Just like olden times, different parts of the world today have\ndifferent kinds of toilets.Some places don\u2019t have toilets at all.\nSome toilets are made for sitting, some are made for squatting. Some\nhave a bucket with water for flushing, others have a tank filled with\nwater and a handle that releases the water. Some toilets have paper\nto wipe the backside, some have a tap or a bucket of water to wash\nup.", "There are some toilets that don\u2019t use water at all. Like the ones\non a plane. With all the turbulence, you certainly don\u2019t want any\nwater in the toilet bowl! The waste is removed by a powerful vacuum\nand stored in a tank below. After the plane lands, the waste is\ndisposed of.\n\nThere are also waterless toilets on the ground. They were designed\nand built for places without easy access to water, such as remote\nvillages in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. They have been working well,\nso wouldn\u2019t it be a good idea to have such toilets everywhere?\nBecause the less water\nwe use, and\nthe less sewage we create, the better for the planet, right?", "Toilets of the future\n\nHow do you make a waterless toilet?\n\nThe first step is to make sure that you don\u2019t let the urine and the\nfaeces mix. No it\u2019s not as gross as it sounds \u2013 it just needs the\npot to be designed in a clever way. Like having a sloping bamboo mat\nact as a sieve that will allow the waste water to pass through, but\ncan hold the poop and send it to a different pit.", "Since urine by itself is not harmful (it\u2019s only the bacteria that\ncollect on open urine that cause the smell and the hazard), it can be\nsafely let into the ground or put to use. Here\u2019s how: Hydrogen can\nbe separated from the urine and used to fuel a generator.Urine also has nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that are great\ningredients for fertilizers.Now that urine is taken care of, what do we do with the solid waste?\nWell,\u00a0if it is properly mixed with ash and grass, and allowed to rest\nin a pit, millions of bacteria will break it down into perfectly\nuseful compost for agriculture.", "These toilets will help us build\u00a0a world where there is no \"waste.\" Instead it is turned into something of use. If\nall houses in a city have such toilets, no sewage comes out\u00a0of them,\nno expensive sewage treatment plants are necessary and no sewage will\nflow through the drains into lakes and rivers!

I would hate to crawl over sharp coral. Soft sand is what I like under my soft belly.\u201cYou won\u2019t have to do it, don\u2019t worry,\u201d another ridley told me. \u201cWe only nest on soft beaches, like the ones on the coasts of Mexico, Costa Rica, and India. But you\u2019ll see for yourself, when it\u2019s time...\u201d", "\u201cHow will I know it\u2019s time?\u201d I asked eagerly as she swam away.\u201cYou will, trust me,\u201d was all she would say.", "I spent some happy years\non the Reef, meeting many of my turtle cousins. Apart from green turtles and\nhawksbills, I met loggerhead turtles - the ones with the really big heads - and\nplenty of other ridleys like me.\nAnd then one day, just\nlike that, I was all grown up, and it was time to go. How did I know it was\ntime? I don\u2019t know. Something deep inside me told me so. I knew I had\nto swim north with all the other ridleys, all along\nthe eastern coast of India until we reached Orissa, and lay my eggs on the soft\nbeaches there. The little compass in my head would tell me how to get there.", "\u201cIt\u2019s only about 2000 kilometers,\u201d sniffed a loggerhead as he swam off in a different direction. Show off! Just because loggerheads like him sometimes swim almost 15000 kilometres to lay their eggs (from California, all the way across the Pacific Ocean to Japan)! I ignored him, and continued gorging on flying fish, my favourite food.The big journey began.\u00a0The water around me was full of other ridleys like me,\u00a0swimming powerfully.", "It wasn\u2019t an easy journey. \u00a0Along the way, there\nwere many dangers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough I was now bigger\nthan most of the fish, there were still sharks that could catch us.", "But\nthe sharks were not as dangerous as the many fishing nets that we had to swim\npast.\nI swam as\ncarefully as I could, avoiding all the nets, especially the terrible trawl\nnets. I managed to escape them all, but some of my friends weren\u2019t so lucky.\nFinally, I reached the\nbeach of Gahirmatha, the place where more ridleys nested than anywhere else in\nthe Indian Ocean.\u00a0It was time to lay my first nest.", "We always nest at night.\nI waited until the tide was a little high, so that I wouldn\u2019t have that far to\ncrawl on the beach. I came in with the surf, and felt land under me for the\nfirst time since my birth.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt felt very strange at\nfirst. Slowly, I dragged myself up the beach to find a dry spot.", "Once I had moved past the high-tide line, the sand became very dry\u00a0and flew all around me as I dragged myself forward with my front flippers.\u00a0\u00a0It is very difficult to move on land. I paused to take a breath and looked up.\u00a0The beach was long and dark.", "Behind the beach was a huge dune and some bushes. I had heard there was a\nlarge forest behind this beach called Bhitarkanika which was full of saltwater\ncrocodiles, king cobras and all kinds of other animals.\n\nThen, suddenly, I saw another animal on the beach. It had four legs and it\nwas digging up a turtle nest. I went back into the water as fast as I could.\nLater that night, I crawled up again, and went up the beach into the Ipomea\ncreepers.\nAt\nmy chosen spot on the beach, I cleared away the dry sand, and made a big pit\nwith my hind flippers. I am very fussy about how exactly I do this. I always\nput one flipper in after the other, scoop up some sand and throw it out.", "", "About\ntwo feet deep and shaped like a flask, with a narrow neck leading into a deep cavity, it was a beauty. I then began laying my eggs.\u00a01, 2,\n3,..., 44, 45,..., 99, 100 and then I was done.\n\nI covered my precious eggs carefully with sand, and thumped it down with my\nbody. Finally I threw some sand around to make sure that no one would find my\nnest.\n\n\n\n\nQuickly,\nquickly, I crawled back into the sea where I felt much safer.", "Two weeks later, I was getting ready to nest\nagain. We usually make enough eggs to lay two or three nests during a season.\nMy common sense told me that it would be a good idea to nest again where I had\nthe previous time. It seemed like a good, safe place.\nThat\nnight, as I was waiting in the shallow water for the tide to be right, I\nnoticed a slight change in the wind. It was stronger and blowing from a\ndifferent direction. Suddenly I realised that there were hundreds, no,\nthousands, of other turtles all waiting to nest. I knew a lot of other ridleys\nwere also swimming around in the Gahirmatha waters waiting to nest, but I had\nnever seen so many together.", "About\ntwo feet deep and shaped like a flask, with a narrow neck leading into a deep cavity, it was a beauty.

The beach was already full.\nThere were thousands of other ridleys, sand was flying in the air, we were all\nbumping into each other.\u00a0Finally, I managed to find a clear spot, and dig a\nnest for myself. The turtle next to me was in such a hurry, she started to lay\nher eggs even before she could finish digging her nest.\u00a0I was shocked, we\nturtles never do that.", "\u201cIt\u2019s an arribada*, lady,\u201d she said, \u201cwe all get a little crazy during this time.\u201d\nNobody really knows why we do this. But it works\nfor us, because millions of hatchlings hatch at the same time. That way, most\nof the little ones escape being caught by birds, crabs and jackals. These days,\nof course, we have humans to worry about as well.* During an arribada - which means \u2018arrival\u2019 in Spanish - thousands of olive ridleys come ashore in a frenzy to nest. Scientists still aren\u2019t sure why they do this.", "Finally,\nit is time to leave and return to my feeding ground. I will spend a year or two\nthere, eating and building up the energy for another visit to Gahirmatha. Green\nTurtle, on the other hand, sometimes needs to eat for five or six years before\nshe has the energy to make her next journey to nest.\nAs I leave, I think of the little ones I have\nleft behind. For 50 to 60 days, the eggs will remain under the sand, warmed by\nthe sun. And then one day, they will hatch, breaking open their shells with the\ntips of their snouts. They will huddle together, over a hundred hatchlings\nunder the sand, waiting for the sun to set and the sand to cool.\u00a0Then, in the\ndarkness, when it is safe, they will come out, all at once. They will see the\nmoonlight bouncing off the sea, and know which way to go. Hopefully they will\nbe no streetlights to make them go in the wrong direction.", "", "They\nwill swim against the waves and dive under the oncoming breakers.", "Oh, there\nwill be big fish and small fish out to get them, and seagulls and eagles, but\nsome will get away. Out into the open sea where they will find their own little\nseaweed rafts, their floating homes for many years.\u00a0Then they will grow up, and\nperhaps they will come to my feeding ground. Perhaps we will meet, though of\ncourse I will not know them.\nStill,\nI am happy knowing that they are out there somewhere, and that someday they\nwill return like me to this very beach to lay their own eggs, and start the\nwhole wonderful circle of life all over again.", "A MESSAGE FROM THE\nOLIVE RIDLEY TO YOU\nSea turtles are in danger worldwide, for many reasons. Some species of\nturtles are killed for their meat, which is used to make turtle soup. The shell\nof the hawksbill turtle is used to make tortoiseshell products like eyeglass\nframes and hair accessories. Many turtle eggs and hatchlings are eaten by\npredators like dogs and crows. But the biggest\ndanger comes from fishing. Many sea turtles get accidentally caught in a\nvariety of fishing nets, drown, and die.\u00a0In India, there are many conservation groups that are trying to save sea turtles. Each coastal state has one or more such groups.", "What can YOU do to protect sea turtles?If you live near a beach where turtles come to nest:\u2022 Help keep the beach clean so that baby and mother turtles do not get hurt.\u2022\n\nEducate the adults in your locality about how streetlights and other lights near the beach can be harmful to turtle hatchlings \u2013 once they hatch, hatchlings figure out where the sea is by looking for the reflection of moonlight on water, so if there are other bright lights in the area, they can get confused and wander off in the wrong direction, and into danger.\u2022 Find out if your state has a local sea turtle conservation group and see if you can join them.\u00a0If you don\u2019t live near a beach:Read more and more about sea turtles and talk to everyone you know about the dangers they are facing.

There was blue and green\nwater in every direction, and the sunlight was playing games with the clouds. I\ntucked my flippers beneath my body and floated for a while, letting the current\ncarry me.\nI did not know where I was.

On and\nin the raft are the Drifters, all the sea\u2019s little and not-so-little creatures\nthat float around the ocean, waiting for something to happen. Gratefully, I\nslipped into the raft. I would not leave this safe haven for many, many years.\n\nBeing on the raft was like going on a world cruise. I enjoyed it very much, but as I grew up, I decided it was time to explore the big wide world outside the raft.", "I had heard\nwonderful things about a place called the Reef where\u00a0a lot of other turtles\nlived. Everyone said the Reef\nwas the fairyland\u00a0of the ocean. They\nsaid it was full of beautiful,\u00a0brightly-coloured creatures, both harmless ones\nlike the clown fish\u00a0and poisonous ones\u00a0like the scorpion fish.\u00a0I wondered how I\nwould find it.", "All\nof a sudden, it became very dark. A huge shadow covered me. Frightened, I\nlooked up, only to see the biggest turtle I had ever seen. His back was soft\nand leathery. I stared. A turtle with a soft back? All the ones I know have\nvery hard backs.\n\nThe big turtle caught me staring. \u201cSurprised?\u201d he grunted pleasantly. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be.

How did I know it was\ntime? I don\u2019t know. Something deep inside me told me so. I knew I had\nto swim north with all the other ridleys, all along\nthe eastern coast of India until we reached Orissa, and lay my eggs on the soft\nbeaches there. The little compass in my head would tell me how to get there.", "\u201cIt\u2019s only about 2000 kilometers,\u201d sniffed a loggerhead as he swam off in a different direction. Show off! Just because loggerheads like him sometimes swim almost 15000 kilometres to lay their eggs (from California, all the way across the Pacific Ocean to Japan)! I ignored him, and continued gorging on flying fish, my favourite food.The big journey began.\u00a0The water around me was full of other ridleys like me,\u00a0swimming powerfully.", "It wasn\u2019t an easy journey. \u00a0Along the way, there\nwere many dangers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough I was now bigger\nthan most of the fish, there were still sharks that could catch us.", "But\nthe sharks were not as dangerous as the many fishing nets that we had to swim\npast.\nI swam as\ncarefully as I could, avoiding all the nets, especially the terrible trawl\nnets. I managed to escape them all, but some of my friends weren\u2019t so lucky.\nFinally, I reached the\nbeach of Gahirmatha, the place where more ridleys nested than anywhere else in\nthe Indian Ocean.\u00a0It was time to lay my first nest.", "We always nest at night.\nI waited until the tide was a little high, so that I wouldn\u2019t have that far to\ncrawl on the beach. I came in with the surf, and felt land under me for the\nfirst time since my birth.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt felt very strange at\nfirst. Slowly, I dragged myself up the beach to find a dry spot.", "Once I had moved past the high-tide line, the sand became very dry\u00a0and flew all around me as I dragged myself forward with my front flippers.\u00a0\u00a0It is very difficult to move on land. I paused to take a breath and looked up.\u00a0The beach was long and dark.", "Behind the beach was a huge dune and some bushes. I had heard there was a\nlarge forest behind this beach called Bhitarkanika which was full of saltwater\ncrocodiles, king cobras and all kinds of other animals.\n\nThen, suddenly, I saw another animal on the beach. It had four legs and it\nwas digging up a turtle nest. I went back into the water as fast as I could.\nLater that night, I crawled up again, and went up the beach into the Ipomea\ncreepers.\nAt\nmy chosen spot on the beach, I cleared away the dry sand, and made a big pit\nwith my hind flippers. I am very fussy about how exactly I do this. I always\nput one flipper in after the other, scoop up some sand and throw it out.", "", "About\ntwo feet deep and shaped like a flask, with a narrow neck leading into a deep cavity, it was a beauty. I then began laying my eggs.\u00a01, 2,\n3,..., 44, 45,..., 99, 100 and then I was done.\n\nI covered my precious eggs carefully with sand, and thumped it down with my\nbody. Finally I threw some sand around to make sure that no one would find my\nnest.\n\n\n\n\nQuickly,\nquickly, I crawled back into the sea where I felt much safer.", "Two weeks later, I was getting ready to nest\nagain. We usually make enough eggs to lay two or three nests during a season.\nMy common sense told me that it would be a good idea to nest again where I had\nthe previous time. It seemed like a good, safe place.\nThat\nnight, as I was waiting in the shallow water for the tide to be right, I\nnoticed a slight change in the wind. It was stronger and blowing from a\ndifferent direction. Suddenly I realised that there were hundreds, no,\nthousands, of other turtles all waiting to nest. I knew a lot of other ridleys\nwere also swimming around in the Gahirmatha waters waiting to nest, but I had\nnever seen so many together.", "About\ntwo feet deep and shaped like a flask, with a narrow neck leading into a deep cavity, it was a beauty. I then began laying my eggs. 1, 2,\n3,..., 44, 45,..., 99, 100 and then I was done.\n\nI covered my precious eggs carefully with sand, and thumped it down with my\nbody. Finally I threw some sand around to make sure that no one would find my\nnest.\n\n\n\n\nQuickly,\nquickly, I crawled back into the sea where I felt much safer.", "And\nthen, we were all rushing up the beach together. The beach was already full.\nThere were thousands of other ridleys, sand was flying in the air, we were all\nbumping into each other.\u00a0Finally, I managed to find a clear spot, and dig a\nnest for myself. The turtle next to me was in such a hurry, she started to lay\nher eggs even before she could finish digging her nest.\u00a0I was shocked, we\nturtles never do that.", "\u201cIt\u2019s an arribada*, lady,\u201d she said, \u201cwe all get a little crazy during this time.\u201d\nNobody really knows why we do this. But it works\nfor us, because millions of hatchlings hatch at the same time. That way, most\nof the little ones escape being caught by birds, crabs and jackals. These days,\nof course, we have humans to worry about as well.* During an arribada - which means \u2018arrival\u2019 in Spanish - thousands of olive ridleys come ashore in a frenzy to nest. Scientists still aren\u2019t sure why they do this.", "Finally,\nit is time to leave and return to my feeding ground. I will spend a year or two\nthere, eating and building up the energy for another visit to Gahirmatha. Green\nTurtle, on the other hand, sometimes needs to eat for five or six years before\nshe has the energy to make her next journey to nest.\nAs I leave, I think of the little ones I have\nleft behind. For 50 to 60 days, the eggs will remain under the sand, warmed by\nthe sun. And then one day, they will hatch, breaking open their shells with the\ntips of their snouts. They will huddle together, over a hundred hatchlings\nunder the sand, waiting for the sun to set and the sand to cool.\u00a0Then, in the\ndarkness, when it is safe, they will come out, all at once. They will see the\nmoonlight bouncing off the sea, and know which way to go. Hopefully they will\nbe no streetlights to make them go in the wrong direction.", "", "They\nwill swim against the waves and dive under the oncoming breakers.", "Oh, there\nwill be big fish and small fish out to get them, and seagulls and eagles, but\nsome will get away. Out into the open sea where they will find their own little\nseaweed rafts, their floating homes for many years.\u00a0Then they will grow up, and\nperhaps they will come to my feeding ground. Perhaps we will meet, though of\ncourse I will not know them.\nStill,\nI am happy knowing that they are out there somewhere, and that someday they\nwill return like me to this very beach to lay their own eggs, and start the\nwhole wonderful circle of life all over again.", "A MESSAGE FROM THE\nOLIVE RIDLEY TO YOU\nSea turtles are in danger worldwide, for many reasons. Some species of\nturtles are killed for their meat, which is used to make turtle soup. The shell\nof the hawksbill turtle is used to make tortoiseshell products like eyeglass\nframes and hair accessories. Many turtle eggs and hatchlings are eaten by\npredators like dogs and crows. But the biggest\ndanger comes from fishing. Many sea turtles get accidentally caught in a\nvariety of fishing nets, drown, and die.\u00a0In India, there are many conservation groups that are trying to save sea turtles. Each coastal state has one or more such groups.", "What can YOU do to protect sea turtles?If you live near a beach where turtles come to nest:\u2022 Help keep the beach clean so that baby and mother turtles do not get hurt.\u2022\n\nEducate the adults in your locality about how streetlights and other lights near the beach can be harmful to turtle hatchlings \u2013 once they hatch, hatchlings figure out where the sea is by looking for the reflection of moonlight on water, so if there are other bright lights in the area, they can get confused and wander off in the wrong direction, and into danger.\u2022 Find out if your state has a local sea turtle conservation group and see if you can join them.\u00a0If you don\u2019t live near a beach:Read more and more about sea turtles and talk to everyone you know about the dangers they are facing.

Some pour water after\nit\u2019s done, others need not. It\u2019s different in different parts of\nthe world, just as it was different at different times in history.", "Toilets of the past\n\nA very long time ago, more than 3,000 years ago,\nthe people of Indus Valley had beautiful houses with toilets built\ninside them. People could finish their business in privacy and pour a\nbucket of water which would flush the waste down a drain. This way,\nthey managed to keep their houses and streets clean.", "The Indus Valley, situated in present day Pakistan and India, is one of the three oldest civilizations that we know of, the other two being Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. From what we can see of the ruins today, the people of Indus Valley had great building skills, were good at making metal and ceramic products, and planned their city-wide drainage systems very elaborately.", "Around the same time, similar toilet arrangements were present in\nother parts of the world. Homes in Egypt and Babylonia had toilets\nbuilt in, and the ruins in Skara Brae in Scotland and the Minoan\nCrete in the Mediterranean show plenty of pipes leading out of what\ndefinitely seems like a toilet inside a house.\u00a0\n\n\nA little later, about 2,000 years ago in Rome, people used public\ntoilets. A long slab of stone had keyhole-shaped cuts at intervals.\nPeople would sit on these openings and do their toilet business while\nhaving a friendly chat with the person next to them. I told you it\nwas a \u201cpublic\u201d toilet!", "How did they clean themselves, do you wonder? After I tell you, you\nmight wish you had never wondered. \n\n\n\nThey took a long stick that had a sponge attached to one end and\ndipped the sponge into water, and then used it to wipe their\nbacksides. After they felt clean, they simply handed the stick over\nto their neighbour, who dipped it in water and used it again. Let me\ngive you a friendly tip here \u2013 if you ever find yourself in this\nplace, make sure you pick the very first seat!", "Not everyone had to poop in public in Rome. If you were super-rich,\nyou would have a chamber pot at home into which you would do your\nbusiness. Once done, you would simply empty the contents onto the\nstreet outside. And if someone happened to walk by at the time, well,\ntoo bad for them!\n\nAbout 500 years ago, Queen Elizabeth of England had a toilet\nconstructed inside her house. It had a pipe leading out into a sewage\npit outside. But she never used it much because the stench from the\nsewer filled the toilet and she could not even breathe. So back to\nthe chamber pot she went.", "Toilets of the present\nToilets these days don\u2019t stink. How did they achieve that?\u00a0In 1775,\nthe English inventor Alexander Cumming figured out a way. Instead of\nusing a straight pipe to connect the toilet to the sewage line, he\nmade it S-shaped. This made sure that while poop and pee and water\ncan go \n\ndown\nthe drain, no\nsmell can come back up. Have you noticed that a little\nwater always stays in the toilet even after flushing? This is what\ncreates the \"seal\" and prevents the foul smell from entering the\nroom through the drain.", "", "Just like olden times, different parts of the world today have\ndifferent kinds of toilets.Some places don\u2019t have toilets at all.\nSome toilets are made for sitting, some are made for squatting. Some\nhave a bucket with water for flushing, others have a tank filled with\nwater and a handle that releases the water. Some toilets have paper\nto wipe the backside, some have a tap or a bucket of water to wash\nup.", "There are some toilets that don\u2019t use water at all. Like the ones\non a plane. With all the turbulence, you certainly don\u2019t want any\nwater in the toilet bowl! The waste is removed by a powerful vacuum\nand stored in a tank below. After the plane lands, the waste is\ndisposed of.\n\nThere are also waterless toilets on the ground. They were designed\nand built for places without easy access to water, such as remote\nvillages in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. They have been working well,\nso wouldn\u2019t it be a good idea to have such toilets everywhere?\nBecause the less water\nwe use, and\nthe less sewage we create, the better for the planet, right?", "Toilets of the future\n\nHow do you make a waterless toilet?\n\nThe first step is to make sure that you don\u2019t let the urine and the\nfaeces mix. No it\u2019s not as gross as it sounds \u2013 it just needs the\npot to be designed in a clever way. Like having a sloping bamboo mat\nact as a sieve that will allow the waste water to pass through, but\ncan hold the poop and send it to a different pit.", "Since urine by itself is not harmful (it\u2019s only the bacteria that\ncollect on open urine that cause the smell and the hazard), it can be\nsafely let into the ground or put to use. Here\u2019s how: Hydrogen can\nbe separated from the urine and used to fuel a generator.Urine also has nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that are great\ningredients for fertilizers.Now that urine is taken care of, what do we do with the solid waste?\nWell,\u00a0if it is properly mixed with ash and grass, and allowed to rest\nin a pit, millions of bacteria will break it down into perfectly\nuseful compost for agriculture.", "These toilets will help us build\u00a0a world where there is no \"waste.\" Instead it is turned into something of use. If\nall houses in a city have such toilets, no sewage comes out\u00a0of them,\nno expensive sewage treatment plants are necessary and no sewage will\nflow through the drains into lakes and rivers!
