The spoon sank to the bottom.\u201cToo heavy,\u201d said Genla.\u201cNot as heavy as a ship in the sea,\u201d said Tenzin.\u201cVery little water spilled this time, not even a quarter of a cup!\u201d said Tashi, a little sad. \u201cAgain, you\u2019re all correct,\u201d said Miss Sonam.", "", "Then she asked: \u201cDo you see? After Genla dropped the apple into the water, the apple pushed some water away before it could float.\u201d\u201cIs that the water that spilled?\u201d asked Tenzin.\u201cYes. So the apple could float because it pushed away more water than its own weight. That means, the apple is lighter than the water it pushed away.\u201d\u201cWhat about the spoon then?\u201d Genla said.\u201cWell, the spoon also pushed some water away. But much less. Certainly less than its own weight. So it sank.\u201d", "\u201cWhat about large ships in the sea, on which there are many people?\u201d asked Tenzin.  \u201c...and many spoons that sink?\u201d added Tashi. \u201cThe spoons won\u2019t make a ship sink, Tashi. The ship is big enough to push away a lot of water. Again, like the apple, more water than its own weight. You don\u2019t notice it because  in the ocean, there is so much water. The ship is still lighter than the amount of water that it pushes away.\u201d They were all quiet for a bit.\u00a0\u201cI think I understand,\u201d said Tenzin, slowly.", "\u201cCan we sail some boats now?\u201d asked Tashi.\u201cIt\u2019s time for my tea,\u201d said Genla. Miss Sonam smiled. \u201cYes, enjoy yourselves!\u201d she said, and gave the boys colour paper to make boats.", "Tenzin and Tashi made more colourful boats and set them down in the water. \u201cI don\u2019t see any water spilling now,\u201d said Tashi. \u201cNo, silly. The water doesn\u2019t always spill. It just gets pushed away,\u201d replied Tenzin. \u201cI think the boats just make some space for themselves in the stream,\u201d said Genla. They watched the blue and yellow boats, red and green boats, and white boats sailing. Like prayer flags floating in the stream.", "", "What is Gravity?What would happen if Tenzin dropped a football from the top of a tree? Would it fall to the ground or rise towards the sky? That\u2019s right, it would fall because of a force called gravity. Did you know that everything gets pulled towards the earth by that force?", "What is Buoyancy?What would happen if Tashi dropped a football into a bucket of water? Would gravity pull the football to the bottom of the bucket? Yes, but in water, there is an upward force that opposes gravity. It is called buoyancy. As gravity tries to pull the football down, buoyancy tries to push it up. In the case of the football, buoyancy is stronger than gravity. So it floats. What would happen if he drops a brick into the bucket? Why?", "What is Displacement?When you drop an object into water, it tries to make space for itself by pushing some water aside. In other words, the object displaces water to make space for itself. Bigger objects, like a basketball, displace more water than smaller ones, like a cricket ball. A long time ago, a Greek scientist named Archimedes discovered that when the weight of the water displaced by an object is more than the weight of the object, it floats. That is why apples float in water. Can you guess why other objects sink?", "What is Density?Every object around us is made of tiny particles that can\u2019t be seen with the naked eye. Density is how closely these particles are packed in an object. The weight of Tashi\u2019s small glass marble may be the same as Miss Sonam\u2019s apple. But why is the apple bigger? Because there is more space between the particles in the apple. In the marble, the particles are much closer to each other. An apple is less dense than a marble. Generally, dense objects sink in water. Here\u2019s a game you can play with your friends: Pick four or five objects. Guess which ones will float and which will sink. Then drop them into a bucket or tub of water to check.

People had no fear of pests such as monkeys and quails. There were plenty of wild fruits and other yummy grasses for them to eat. Mwese villagers were good farmers. They cultivated maize, groundnuts, paddy, beans, sweet potatoes and cassava.One year, there a drought. The crops withered. They did not harvest as much as they did in other years.  Wild animals too suffered. They sought food and water. The monkeys invaded people\u2019s farms and ate what little was there.The villagers had a difficult time keeping them off. They threw stones and arrows, but the monkeys refused to go away. They would simply hide nearby only to come out again when they saw there was no one around.Mzee Malele was the leader of Mwese Village. He called a meeting and said, \u201cMy brothers and sisters, we must now guard our crops in turns. We must do so during the day and the night.\u201d", "The villagers agreed. The timetable was drawn. Each had his or her turn. Only the children, the elderly, and the sick were excused. Whoever was on duty had to be fully armed.The monkeys knew that it was not going to be easy for them. People were guarding everywhere to stop the monkeys from invading their farms. The monkeys thought they were now going to die of hunger. They called a meeting to discuss on what to do.After long discussions, they decided that one of the monkeys should chop off his tail. The others then could him dress him like a man and send him to ask for the job of guarding the crops.The monkeys knew their monkey-in-disguise that would have to allow the other monkeys to come and eat. So, they chose one who would undertake this task. The one they chose was most courageous.They cut off his tail. In two weeks\u2019 time, the wound had healed. They called him Mr. Maseleni. They helped him dress up. It was difficult to differentiate him from human beings. Mr. Maseleni vowed that he would help his fellow monkeys.Soon, he was ready to go and ask to become a guard. Mr. Maseleni met a group of villagers on their way to guard duty.", "He introduced himself, \u201cI am from Mapori Village. I\u2019m looking for a job guarding farms.\u201dThe villagers directed him to the village chief\u2019s house.At the village, Mr. Maseleni met with the chief. Chief Jumbe summoned a village council. They discussed the new application.After a long discussion, it was agreed that Mr. Maseleni should be given the job. It was also decided that he would live at the chief\u2019s home.", "Mr. Maseleni began his job immediately. He did well at first. When the monkeys came, he chased them away fiercely. Now that he could eat, Mr. Maseleni was not keeping his promise! When his fellow monkeys ran and jumped on tree branches, he beat them mercilessly.The villagers took to liking Mr. Maseleni. They decided to raise his salary.The monkeys stopped coming to the farms. They were afraid that Mr. Maseleni would catch them and beat them up. They became weak with hunger.As their condition worsened, they called a meeting.At the meeting, they decided to secretly send another monkey to Mwese Village. This monkey could reach out to Mr. Maseleni to remind him of his promise.\nThey also sent the message that if he did not to honour his promise, they would give him back his tail.When Mr. Maseleni got the message, he pretended not to understand.\u201cGo, tell them, they don\u2019t know me. I don\u2019t know them. I\u2019m not a monkey. I\u2019m the chief guard here.\u201dThe messenger went back to the other monkeys. The monkeys thought that they would die of hunger. So, they decided to find a way of sending Mr. Maseleni his tail.", "On the following day, the monkeys started their journey to Mwese Village.The villagers woke up to the noise of the monkeys. When they came out of their houses, they were greeted by dust. Some monkeys were dancing, others were singing:Mr. MaseleniLet\u2019s give him his tail back!Let's give him his tail back!Ti-tit-iiii! Ti-tit-iii!Let\u2019s give him his tail back!Let's give him his tail back!When the villagers heard the message in the song, they were surprised. When Mr. Maseleni heard the song, he knew that his days were numbered. The villagers headed to the village chief, where the monkeys were also heading . Every villager came out with a weapon.They threw the arrows at the monkeys. But Chief Jumbe stopped them and said, \u201cLeave them. It appears they have a message. If they cause any trouble, then we\u2019ll attack them.\u201dThe leader of the monkeys came forward. He said, \u201cWe\u2019ve come to hand back Mr. Maseleni his tail. He is one of us. We had turned him to look like a human being so that he would help us steal the maize.\u201d\u201cBut, he has not honoured his promise. Each time he sees us, he chases us away. He beats us mercilessly,\u201d said the leader.Chief Jumbe and all who were around were surprised. He decided that Mr. Maseleni be brought forward. When asked, Mr. Maseleni had no explanation. He stared at the ground.", "Then, suddenly, the monkey who was carrying the tail jumped. He pushed the tail into Mr. Maseleni\u2019s back and it stuck there. Immediately the monkeys took away Mr. Maseleni.The villagers heard Mr. Maseleni crying for help. He begged the monkeys not to turn him into a monkey again. They dragged him to the forest.The villagers were surprised.They were happy that their maize was ready for harvesting. They no longer feared the monkeys. Mwese villagers no longer wanted to hire someone from outside their village.Chief Jumbe issued a directive that all visitors must be checked well.This helped to note all who were good and those who were bad. The chief also wanted them to harvest their maize together.", "From that day on, every villager took turns in guarding the crops. The children from Mwese Village even started a game for evening time. They sang about Mr. Maseleni.\nLet\u2019s give him his tail back!Let's give him his tail back!Ti-tit-iiii! Ti-tit-iii!Let\u2019s give him his tail back!Let's give him his tail back!\nThen they would give someone a tail made of rope.", "The monkeys went to the forest along with Mr. Maseleni. They gave him the punishment to guard all the other monkeys. To this day, whenever there is a group of monkeys one stays back in the trees to watch out for danger.Whenever, there is a danger coming, the guard notifies them and the other monkeys can run away.Some monkeys call this guard Mr. Maseleni."], "Kiswahili": ["Hapo zamani za kale kijiji cha Mwese kilikuwa na rutuba tele.

Waliamua kumuongezea ule mshahara wake mara mbili ya aliokuwa anapata hapo awali. Nyani waliacha kabisa kufika mashambani, walihofia kukamatwa na kupigwa na Nyani mwenzao waliyemtuma. Kule msituni nyani wote walidhoofika sana kwa sababu ya njaa.Hali ilipokuwa mbaya waliitisha mkutano. Waliamua kumtuma Nyani mmoja aende katika Kijiji cha Mwese kwa siri. Lengo la safari yao ni kumkumbusha Bwana Maseleni ahadi waliyowekeana.\nPia, walimtuma akamwabie kuwa asipojirekebisha, watamrudishia mkia wake. Habari zilipomfikia Bwana Maseleni, akajifanya hasikii. Akamwambia yule nyani, \u201cNenda ukawaambie kuwa wasinijue na mimi sio nyani, mimi sasa ni mkuu wa walinzi wote.\u201dYule mjumbe alipeleka taarifa hizo kwa nyani wenzake. Baada ya kusubiri muda mrefu bila mafanikio ya kupata chakula, waliamua waende kijijini wakamrudishie mkia wake.Walifanya mkutano wa jinsi ya kwenda kijijini na kumrudishia mkia wake. Waliamua kwenda siku inayofuata asubuhi. Siku iliyofuata asubuhi na mapema nyani wote walitoka na kwenda katika Kijiji cha Mwese.", "Baada ya muda wanakijiji waliamshwa na kelele za nyani walipotoka nje wakaona vumbi linatimka na nyani wengine wanakuja wakicheza na kuimba.Bwana MaseleniKiitikio: Tumpe mkia wake tukampe x 2Ti ti tiiiKiitikio: Tukampe mkia wake tukampe x 2\nWanakijiji waliposikia walishangaa, kuusikia wimbo huo.

Ambako kundi la nyani lilikokuwa linaelekea. Kila mmoja alitoka na silaha yake.Wanakijiji walianza kuwatupia mishale na mikuki nyani. Lakini Chifu Jumbe aliwakataza alisema, \u201cWaacheni, huenda wana ujumbe lakini wakileta matata tutawashambulia.\u201d Walipofika katika uwanja wa nyumba ya Chifu Jumbe nyani wote wakanyamaza.Mkuu wa nyani aliyeitwa Gendayeka alijitokeza mbele ya wote na kuanza kusema. \u201cSisi tumekuja kumrudishia mkia Bwana Maseleni.

Kila akituona shambani anatufukuza kama hatujui na pia, hutupiga sana.\u201d Alimaliza kusema Gendayeka.\n\n\nChifu Jumbe na watu wote walishangaa sana. Chifu Jumbe aliamua Bwana Maseleni aitwe. Alipofika aliulizwa ukweli wa mambo yale yote yaliyoelezwa, naye hakuwa na la kusema alitazama chini tu.", "Ghafla! Yule Nyani aliyeshika mkia alimrukia bwana Maseleni na kumchomeka mkia wake. Bila kupoteza wakati, nyani wote walimchukua Bwana Maseleni na kuondoka naye mbio mbio.Bwana Maseleni alisikika akilia kuwa wamsamehe wasimrudishie mkia. Hakuna hata mmoja wao aliyemsikiliza, walitembea naye kwa haraka kuelekea msituni. Wanakijiji walistaajabu sana kwa yale yote yaliyotokea.\nKilichowafurahisha ni kuwa, mahindi yao yalikuwa yameshakauka na hivyo hakukuwa na hofu ya Nyani tena. Wanakijiji wa Mwese wakaendelea na ulinzi wao, na hawakutaka tena kuajiri mlinzi kutoka nje ya kijiji chao.Chifu Jumbe alitangaza kuwa kila mmoja ataanza kulinda mazao hadi yakauke kabisa. Akatoa amri ya kumchunguza kwa makini kila mgeni anayefika katika kijiji hiki kuishi au kuomba kazi.", "Chifu Jumbe alisema kuwa, hatua hii itawasaidia kuwabaini wageni wa kweli na sio wa kweli. Chifu pia aliwakumbusha wananchi kuwa mazao yatakapokauka, yatavunwa kwa umoja kama ilivyokuwa kawaida ya kijiji cha Mwese.\n\n\nTangu siku hiyo kila mwanakijiji wa Mwese alishika zamu yake ya ulinzi kama mwanzo. Watoto wa Kijiji cha Mwese walianzisha mchezo kila siku jioni. Walikuwa wanazunguka huku wakiimba na kucheza.

All you need is\ntime and patience.\n\nFirst, find\na nice patch of empty land near your house. Get a friend, sibling or\ngrown-up to help you plant the seed you saved in that patch. Make\nsure the soil is loose and there's plenty of sun. It may take several\nweeks of waiting, watering and watching before your seed turns into a\nplant, so don't worry and definitely don't hurry.", "Once your\nseed germinates and grows into a healthy mango plant, get ready for a\nlot more waiting, watering and watching. Take care that your plant\ndoesn't get eaten up by insects or animals, or get stepped on by\nsomeone. If all this waiting is making you feel bored, read a few\nbooks, sing some songs, and plant some more plants!\n\nAfter a few\nyears, as you grow taller, your mango plant will grow tall with you,\nuntil it becomes a big tree that you can climb and picnic under. This\nis when the real fun begins. By now, your tree will have started\nmaking its own mangoes, which you and your friends can eat. Even\nbetter, those mangoes will soon start attracting other mango-loving\ncreatures to your tree: birds, ants, squirrels, bats, monkeys,\nspiders and lots more.\n\n\n\n\nSome of\nthese creatures will come to eat the fruit, some will come to feed on\nthe tree's sap, some to drink nectar from its flowers, and some\ncreatures will even come to eat some of the other creatures hanging\naround the tree. But it's not all about eating. Some creatures may\ncome just to rest in your tree's shade, or to take a nap in its\nbranches. Your tree has many different uses for every different\ncreature!\n\nSpend some\ntime every day watching who visits your mango tree, at which time of\nthe day they come, and what they do. Write down what you see in your\nnotebook. Also draw pictures of what you see.\n\n\n\n\nSee how\nmuch you've done and learned with just one mango seed? Isn't\ntree-planting fun?

The river was always a blessing, keeping\nMysore fertile, but, like every other river, it used to flood in the\nmonsoons and run dry in the summer.

Five years later, on August\n15, 1947, the non-violent war got the results Gandhiji wanted - the\nBritish left, and India became independent.

The campaign inspired nearly 70 illustrators to donate their time and skills to India\u2019s first open-source story-publishing platform for children.What started out as an experimental campaign soon blossomed into a carnival of art, birthing nearly 500 new illustrations.

Chipego lives with his father, mother and his  little sister Mutinta.  There is one more special member of the family, Pendo the cow. \nChipego helps his father to look after Pendo in exchange for pocket money that he uses to buy books. \nMeet Chipego. He is 10 years old and in Grade 5 at the village school. Chipego always comes top of his class. \"What's his secret?\" his schoolmates ask themselves.\n\n\"He's excellent in reading and writing. How does he do it?\" they wonder. Chipego tells them it is because he reads lots of books. While they waste their time doing nothing, he spends all his free time reading.", "Chipego sometimes earns K80.00 a week in pocket money. He spends most of the pocket money on books at the second-hand book shop in his village.\n\nSo how does Chipego earn enough pocket money for these books? Read on to find out.", "Meet Pendo, the family's milking cow. She produces over 20 litres of milk per day. Chipego's father sells the milk.\n\nA cow needs food and water, and time to graze in the field. So each day after school, Chipego helps with this work. Chipego's father gives him pocket money for the work he does. And it is this money that Chipego saves to buy books each week.", "First, Chipego gives Pendo a bunch of carrots. He gives her exactly eight carrots a day. Each day he picks the carrots from his father's vegetable garden, enough for a day at a time.\n\nYou can work it out. You will find that Pendo eats nearly 60 carrots a week. Can you tell exactly how many?", "After that, Chipego takes Pendo to graze in the fields. His father warned him to watch the time and give Pendo not  more than three quarters of an hour to graze.\n\nPendo usually starts grazing at about14:15 hrs, so that Chipego can take her back to the milking shed at 15 hours. In winter when it gets dark earlier, Chipego may start grazing earlier, around 13:30 hrs.", "Next Chipego gives Pendo water. Without water Pendo won't produce milk, no matter how much Chipego feeds her. Chipego fetches buckets of water from the village pump because there isn't one nearby.\n\nPendo's trough holds about 30 litres of water. Chipego's bucket only holds 5 litres. So to fill the trough Chipego has to make many trips. Can you work out how many trips he has to make?", "Then, Chipego takes Pendo to his father to get her daily 12 kg bag of grain. Chipego calculates that's almost 90 kg a week.\n\nEach bag costs K39.00. Chipego works out the cost of grain for each week. First he works out the cost of 7 bags at K40.00, which makes K280.00 Then he subtracts K7.00 to get K273.00 \"That's over K1 000 a month!\" Chipego estimates. Is he correct?", "Chipego's father milks Pendo twice a day. She produces about 24 litres of milk a day, so about 12 litres for each milking.\n\nSometimes Chipego helps with the milking but it is not as easy as it looks. \"One day,\" he thinks to himself, \"I will have my own cows and I will have to do all the milking myself.\"", "His father pours the milk from the big bucket into smaller two litre cans or one litre bottles. He then sells the milk for K8.00 a litre.\n\nOnce a week Chipego's father donates 25 litres of milk to Bulela School feeding scheme. Each child gets a quarter litre of this milk. That means that 100 children get milk on this day.", "For each litre of milk sold, his father gives Chipego 50 ngwee. That doesn't sound like a lot, but if his father sells 24 litres a day, it adds up to quite a bit. Can you tell how much?\n\nChipego saves his money until Saturday when he makes a trip to the book shop. Each book costs less than k10.00, so in a good week, he can buy quite a few.", "Chipego also loves to drink Pendo's milk. His father says that milk helps to build strong bones and teeth and makes a person fit and healthy.\n\nSo by drinking milk and eating lots of vegetables from his father's garden, Chipego is strong and healthy. He seldom gets sick and never goes hungry. His mother loves making mabisi using Pendo's milk too. His young sister enjoys adding the milk to her chibwantu! Hmmm! Yummy!", "Chipego never forgets to thank Pendo at the end of each day. He rewards her with extra carrots or spinach leaves that he finds lying around the garden.\n\n\"Thank you Pendo, you are my best friend! It is thanks to you that I am strong, healthy and clever. If not for you I would never be able to buy all the books that help me be top of my class.\" One day I will be a veterinary  doctor because of you!\nPendo is very lucky because Mutinta, Chipego's mother and Father also rewards her!

Vilevile, anayamwaga kwenye chupa za lita 1. Halafu anayauza maziwa hayo kwa Shilingi 8 kwa kila lita. \n\nMara moja kwa juma, babake Ndalo huchanga lita 25 za maziwa kusaidia mpango wa chakula shuleni.

One day while Gingile was out hunting he heard the call of Ngede. Gingile's mouth began to water at the thought of honey. He stopped and listened carefully,  searching until he saw the bird in the branches above his head. \"Chitik-chitik-chitik,\" the little bird rattled,  as he flew to the next tree,  and the next. \"Chitik,  chitik,  chitik,\" he called,  stopping from time to time to be sure that Gingile followed.", "After half an hour,  they reached a huge wild fig tree. Ngede hopped about madly among the branches. He then settled on one branch and cocked his head at Gingile as if to say,  \"Here it is! Come now! What is taking you so long?\" Gingile couldn't see any bees from under the tree,  but he trusted Ngede.", "So Gingile put down his hunting spear under the tree,  gathered some dry twigs and made a small fire. When the fire was burning well,  he put a long dry stick into the heart of the fire. This wood was especially known to make lots of smoke while it burned. He began climbing,  holding the cool end of the smoking stick in his teeth.", "Soon he could hear the loud buzzing of the busy bees. They were coming in and out of a hollow in the tree trunk \u2013 their hive. When Gingile reached the hive he pushed the smoking end of the stick into the hollow. The bees came rushing out,  angry and mean. They flew away because they didn't like the smoke \u2013 but not before they had given Gingile some painful stings!", "When the bees were out,  Gingile pushed his hands into the nest. He took out handfuls of the heavy comb,  dripping with rich honey and full of fat,  white grubs. He put the comb carefully in the pouch he carried on his shoulder,  and started to climb down the tree.", "Ngede eagerly watched everything that Gingile was doing. He was waiting for him to leave a fat piece of honeycomb as a thank-you offering to the Honeyguide. Ngede flittered from branch to branch,  closer and closer to the ground. Finally Gingile reached the bottom of the tree. Ngede perched on a rock near the boy and waited for his reward.", "But,  Gingile put out the fire,  picked up his spear and started walking home,  ignoring the bird. Ngede called out angrily,  \"VIC-torr! VIC-torrr!\" Gingile stopped,  stared at the little bird and laughed aloud. \"You want some honey,  do you,  my friend? Ha! But I did all the work,  and got all the stings. Why should I share any of this lovely honey with you?\" Then he walked off. Ngede was furious! This was no way to treat him! But he would get his revenge.", "One day several weeks later Gingile again heard the honey call of the Ngede. He remembered the delicious honey,  and eagerly followed the bird once again. After leading Gingile along the edge of the forest,  Ngede stopped to rest in a great umbrella thorn. \"Ahh,\" thought Gingile. \"The hive must be in this tree.\" He quickly made his small fire and began to climb,  the smoking branch in his teeth. Ngede sat and watched.", "Gingile climbed,  wondering why he didn't hear the usual buzzing. \"Perhaps the hive is deep in the tree,\" he thought to himself. He pulled himself up another branch. But instead of the hive,  he was staring into the face of a leopard! Leopard was very angry at having her sleep so rudely interrupted. She narrowed her eyes,  opened her mouth to reveal her very large and very sharp teeth.", "Before Leopard could take a swipe at Gingile,  he rushed down the tree. In his hurry he missed a branch,  and landed with a heavy thud on the ground twisting his ankle. He hobbled off as fast as he could. Luckily for him,  Leopard was still too sleepy to chase him.

Okay, what about Deca, what does it mean?\u201d questioned Dad. \u201cTen!

They lived in a small monastery on a beautiful green hill. Here, it was lovely when it rained.When Tashi looked out of the window late one morning, the rain was coming down hard. Rivulets were forming where the water had made paths on the muddy road. Tashi couldn\u2019t think of a better way to spend the afternoon than sailing paper boats.Tashi and Tenzin set about making many paper boats. As soon as it stopped raining, the boys ran outside. They sailed the paper boats they had made \u2013 some big, some small. The boats floated nicely along the path. The two young monks were happy.", "", "As they trotted back home, they saw Gen Lobsang. Genla lived in the monastery and told the children the most wonderful stories. \u201cGenla,\u201d shouted Tenzin. \u201cCan you tell us a story about why boats float?\u201d Gen Lobsang thought for a minute and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why boats \u2013 or ships, for that matter \u2013 float.

Please don\u2019t eat it.\u201d", "Miss Sonam asked Tashi to fill the tub to the brim. \u201cNow, Genla,\u201d she said, \u201cdip the apple in the tub, please. Enough to cover it completely in water.\u201d", "Genla gently dropped the fruit into the tub and pushed it down with his little finger. Some water spilled. Tashi and Tenzin shrieked, \u201cThe water is overflowing!\u201dGenla let go of the apple, and it rose up.Miss Sonam was smiling. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d she asked.", "\u201cGenla pushed the apple into the water,\u201d said Tenzin. \u201cWater spilled,\u201d said Tashi. \u201cThe apple\u2019s floating,\u201d said Genla.\u201cCorrect answers, all of you!\u201d said Miss Sonam. \u201cNow, can you tell me how much water spilled, Tenzin? Was it about half a cup? One cup?\u201d", "Tenzin looked at the water on the table and on the floor. He said, \u201cMaybe one cup.\u201d\u201cThat sounds right,\u201d said Miss Sonam. Genla and Tashi nodded in agreement. \u201cNow, take the apple out. Tashi, fill up the tub again. Here, Tenzin. Will you drop this spoon into the water?\u201dTenzin did. The spoon sank to the bottom.\u201cToo heavy,\u201d said Genla.\u201cNot as heavy as a ship in the sea,\u201d said Tenzin.\u201cVery little water spilled this time, not even a quarter of a cup!\u201d said Tashi, a little sad. \u201cAgain, you\u2019re all correct,\u201d said Miss Sonam.", "", "Then she asked: \u201cDo you see? After Genla dropped the apple into the water, the apple pushed some water away before it could float.\u201d\u201cIs that the water that spilled?\u201d asked Tenzin.\u201cYes. So the apple could float because it pushed away more water than its own weight. That means, the apple is lighter than the water it pushed away.\u201d\u201cWhat about the spoon then?\u201d Genla said.\u201cWell, the spoon also pushed some water away. But much less. Certainly less than its own weight. So it sank.\u201d", "\u201cWhat about large ships in the sea, on which there are many people?\u201d asked Tenzin.  \u201c...and many spoons that sink?\u201d added Tashi. \u201cThe spoons won\u2019t make a ship sink, Tashi. The ship is big enough to push away a lot of water. Again, like the apple, more water than its own weight. You don\u2019t notice it because  in the ocean, there is so much water. The ship is still lighter than the amount of water that it pushes away.\u201d They were all quiet for a bit.\u00a0\u201cI think I understand,\u201d said Tenzin, slowly.", "\u201cCan we sail some boats now?\u201d asked Tashi.\u201cIt\u2019s time for my tea,\u201d said Genla. Miss Sonam smiled. \u201cYes, enjoy yourselves!\u201d she said, and gave the boys colour paper to make boats.", "Tenzin and Tashi made more colourful boats and set them down in the water. \u201cI don\u2019t see any water spilling now,\u201d said Tashi. \u201cNo, silly. The water doesn\u2019t always spill. It just gets pushed away,\u201d replied Tenzin. \u201cI think the boats just make some space for themselves in the stream,\u201d said Genla. They watched the blue and yellow boats, red and green boats, and white boats sailing. Like prayer flags floating in the stream.", "", "What is Gravity?What would happen if Tenzin dropped a football from the top of a tree? Would it fall to the ground or rise towards the sky? That\u2019s right, it would fall because of a force called gravity. Did you know that everything gets pulled towards the earth by that force?", "What is Buoyancy?What would happen if Tashi dropped a football into a bucket of water? Would gravity pull the football to the bottom of the bucket? Yes, but in water, there is an upward force that opposes gravity. It is called buoyancy. As gravity tries to pull the football down, buoyancy tries to push it up. In the case of the football, buoyancy is stronger than gravity. So it floats. What would happen if he drops a brick into the bucket? Why?", "What is Displacement?When you drop an object into water, it tries to make space for itself by pushing some water aside. In other words, the object displaces water to make space for itself. Bigger objects, like a basketball, displace more water than smaller ones, like a cricket ball. A long time ago, a Greek scientist named Archimedes discovered that when the weight of the water displaced by an object is more than the weight of the object, it floats. That is why apples float in water. Can you guess why other objects sink?", "What is Density?Every object around us is made of tiny particles that can\u2019t be seen with the naked eye. Density is how closely these particles are packed in an object. The weight of Tashi\u2019s small glass marble may be the same as Miss Sonam\u2019s apple. But why is the apple bigger? Because there is more space between the particles in the apple. In the marble, the particles are much closer to each other. An apple is less dense than a marble. Generally, dense objects sink in water. Here\u2019s a game you can play with your friends: Pick four or five objects. Guess which ones will float and which will sink. Then drop them into a bucket or tub of water to check.
