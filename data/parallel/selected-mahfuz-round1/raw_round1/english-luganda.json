Then Nonkungu set off for her uncle's village.", "On her journey,  Nonkungu came to a stream. She crossed the stream and met a girl wearing rags.

They set off together. After a while, the girl said to Nonkungu,  \"Your clothes are lovely. Please let me try them on.\"", "Nonkungu took off her clothes and gave them to the girl. When the girl took off her rags,  Nonkungu saw that she had a tail! Nonkungu was afraid.\u00a0\n\nShe realised that the girl was really an imbulu. \n\nThey walked a little further,  and then Nonkungu asked,  \"Please give me back my clothes and beads.\"", "The imbulu answered,  \"Let me wear them until we get to the next tree.\" She pointed to a tree on a hill nearby. \n\nWhen they reached the tree, Nonkungu asked, \"Please give me back my clothes and beads.\" \n\nThe imbulu replied, \"Just let me wear them until we get to that field.\" She pointed to a field on the next hill.", "At last they reached the field. Again Nonkungu asked the imbulu,  \"Please give me back my clothes and my beads.\" \n\nThe imbulu replied, \"Just let me wear them until we get to that hut where the women are sitting.\" She pointed to a hut in the distance.\u00a0\n\nBut when they finally got near to the hut, the imbulu pushed Nonkungu back and ran ahead.", "The imbulu said to the women at the hut, \"Look at this girl wearing rags.

The imbulu went to Uncle Mtonyama's hut.", "Mtonyama and his family welcomed the imbulu, who said she was their niece.\u00a0\n\nPoor Nonkungu continued to hide away. She sang this song: \n\n\"Oh misery me,  misery me.\u00a0I was sent to stay with my Uncle Mtonyama.\u00a0On the way I met an imbulu. She took my skirt and my beads.\u00a0Oh misery me,  misery me.\"", "One day,  Mtonyama's eldest son was walking in the field and heard the sad song.\u00a0He didn't know who was singing,  but when he got home,  he told his father the words. \n\nMtonyama went into the fields. He heard the song,  and looked until he found Nonkungu.", "Nonkungu told her uncle everything that \u00a0had happened. Mtonyama took her back to the village and hid her in a hut. He knew what he was going to do to catch the imbulu. \n\nMtonyama had heard that an imbulu's tail loves milk and that it can't go past milk without drinking some.\u00a0So he told his men to dig a hole and fill it with sour milk.", "Then Mtonyama called all the girls of the village to take part in a jumping competition. \n\nThe imbulu was worried.
