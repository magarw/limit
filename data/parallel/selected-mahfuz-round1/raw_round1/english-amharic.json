What a lovely raincoat!' Mannu danced happily holding the shining red raincoat that his parents had bought for him.'Mamma, may I wear the raincoat now?' Manu asked his mother.Mamma said, 'No, my child. You can wear it when it rains. It should start raining soon. But as of now I don't see any signs of the rain.'", "But, Monday was a bright sunny day, full of golden sunshine.Mannu looked out of the window every now and then and asked his mother,'Mamma, will it rain today?'Mamma\u00a0 peeped out of the window and said, ' I don't think it will rain today. You cannot wear the raincoat today. People will laugh at you, if you do.'", "On Tuesday also Mannu kept looking at the sky. And the raincoat was kept right next to him, ready to be used. But the sky was a nice blue and as bright as it was on Monday.Mannu was disappointed,'Mamma, when will I be able to use the raincoat?''There is just a single cloud in the sky today, and that too a white one. I don't think you will get a chance to wear the raincoat today.'Mamma said.", "Wednesday again was a very hot sunny day.Mannu was getting worried, 'Mamma, why is it not raining yet?'He tried to put the raincoat on at home. But had to immediately take it off because he felt too hot in it.Mamma, in her eagerness to comfort him said, 'I think it will rain soon, probably by afternoon.'", "On Thursday, there was the school picnic. Mannu was eager to show off the raincoat to his school buddies.'Mamma, shall I carry the raincoat to the picnic. What if it rains there?' Mannu asked.'Don't, my pet. It will not rain today. See those white clouds? And they are also so far away.' Mamma tried to comfort him.", "And... at last\u00a0 on Friday, the sky looked quite dark with black clouds. Mannu kept the raincoat ready at hand.'Mamma, it will rain today, right mamma?' Mannu asked excitedly. The peacock also seemed to think so and started dancing. The tortoise came out of it's hiding and looked up at the sky hoping perhaps to feel cooler after the hot summer.'I think so. Today the sky is full of black clouds.' Mamma smiled at Mannu's excitement and was happy for him.", "On the Saturday morning there was a loud thunder.\u00a0 And also lightening.'Mamma, it that not lightening? Now it will surely rain, right Mamma?' asked Manu.He ran out on the lawns and saw that a frog and a tortoise also had come out of their hiding.", "And.. tip...tap...tip...tap... came down the raindrops!Mannu, loved the rains...\nraincoat or no raincoat.'Oh, it is raining; it is raining.' Thus shouting\u00a0 Mannu ran out of the house and started\u00a0 \njumping and dancing in the rain.

Every evening they made dinner together. After they washed the dishes,  Simbegwire's father helped her with homework.", "One day,  Simbegwire's father came home later than usual. \"Where are you my child?\" he called. Simbegwire ran to her father. She stopped still when she saw that he was holding a woman's hand. \"I want you to meet someone special,  my child. This is Anita,\" he said smiling.", "\"Hello Simbegwire,  your father told me a lot about you,\" said Anita. But she did not smile or take the girl's hand. Simbegwire's father was happy and excited.

You left me.", "The next morning,  Simbegwire sang the song again. When the women came to wash their clothes at the stream,  they heard the sad song coming from the tall tree.

When she saw the girl and the pieces of colourful blanket,  she cried,  \"Simbegwire,  my brother's child!\" The other women stopped washing and helped Simbegwire to climb down from the tree. Her aunt hugged the little girl and tried to comfort her.", "Simbegwire's aunt took the child to her own house. She gave Simbegwire warm food,  and tucked her in bed with her mother's blanket.

Sometimes he brings a jewel green bottle rinsed by the waves.", "Some days Yusuf's father brings a story. Like the time they found sea turtles on the sand,  hundreds washed up in a storm. \"Whaaat?

Whaaat?\" cried the gulls. \"There's enough sea for everybody,\" said Yusuf's father. He showed them the fishing license that had been Oupa Salie's. \"Waves for all. Water for free.\"", "Ouma Safiya watches through her binoculars,  her fingers curled in curiosity. The shark siren sounds. Swimmers run back to the sand and grab their towels. Surfers rush to the shore,  carrying their boards under their arms. Under the showers they strip off their wetsuits. \"Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?\" cry the gulls. \"What will Yusuf's father bring from the ocean?\"", "Yusuf's father and uncle and cousins heave and pull. A little shark has been caught. It twists and thrashes in the waves. Yusuf's father untangles the nets,  singing to the shark: \"Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop.

She can sit in the cart.\"", "But Meri said, \"No, I want my doll.\" When Meri would not let him take the doll, Abel was very angry. He grabbed the doll and pulled her. Meri pulled the doll's other arm. Abel pulled and Meri pulled. The doll's arm came off!", "Meri cried and ran to her mother. \"Look Mother,\" she said, \"Abel pulled my doll's arm and it came off. He wanted my doll to sit in his new cart but I wanted to play with her.\"Her mother said, \"Abel did not behave well.\"", "Mother thought about\u00a0how to teach her son not to touch his sister's toys. She had an idea.She went to her friend who was a doctor and she asked, \"I want you to help me please.\" The doctor replied, \"How can I help, my friend?\"", "Mother answered, \"My son Abel is behaving badly these days. He pulled the arm off his sister's doll. He must not do that.Tomorrow I will tell him to bring the doll to you to put the doll's arm on again.\"", "\"Please tell Abel that he must pay you for your work. He doesn't have any money, so you will tell him to clean your big old car that is always dusty,\" said mother.Her friend laughed and said, \"Ee\u2013ee! That will be good.\"", "Abel's mother went back to her house. She asked Abel, \"When you are ill or hurt where do you go?\" Abel answered, \"When I am ill or hurt, I must go to the doctor.\"Abel's mother said, \"You hurt the doll, now you must take her to the doctor.\"", "So Abel took the doll to the doctor. \"This doll is hurt very badly. My mother told me to bring the doll to you. Doctor, can you give her a new arm?\"The doctor agreed to look after the doll. She was able to make a new arm.", "The doctor said to Abel, \"The doll has a new arm. You must pay me. How much money do you have?\"Abel answered, \"Please doctor, I don't have any money. I can't pay you for your work.\"", "The doctor said, \"Well! You don't have any money? My big car is very dirty! Clean my car and that is how you will pay me.\"Abel got a bucket of water and a clean cloth. It took a long time to wash that dirty car.", "Then Abel took the doll back to Meri. She was delighted and she said to Abel, \"You are a good brother.

The kota is stuffed with chips,  polony and atchar,  and covered in creamy melting cheese. Tebogo is impressed,  \"It's true,  and the bread is really packed with filling!\" Just then Scelo arrives with his lunch and Tebogo says to his friend,  \"Hey Scelo,  look at this kota!\"", "Jabu notices Scelo's face and asks,  \"Why you are looking so serious!\"\u00a0 Scelo puts his kota on the bench next to Jabu's kota. \"I got my kota from Mr Motaung. The kotas are equal in size,  but mine has less filling!\" \"Yes,\" says Nomsa,  \"that's exactly why so many kids are buying from Mr Mkhize's shop now.\"", "\"So Mr Mkhize is a changed man? He used to slice one loaf of bread into five parts to make his kotas!\" says Tebogo. \"Ah!\" replies Nomsa,  \"that was not a kota at all!\" \n\n\"Why was it not a kota?\" asks Scelo.", "\"Ha Scelo!\" laughs Nomsa. \"Don't you remember what our teacher taught us about fractions? Cutting one loaf of bread into five equal pieces does not give us quarters. It gives us fifths.\"\u00a0 Scelo thinks,  then he says,  \"I remember! Each part of a whole divided into 5 equal parts is \u2155 of the whole. Each part of a whole divided into 4 equal pieces is \u00bc of the whole.\"", "Zodwa interrupts,  \"But hey guys,  what is going on with Mr Motaung's kota's? They're a quarter of a loaf,  but they contain less than Mr Mkhize's kotas.\" Jabu frowns and says to the group,  \"If Motaung is having problems and goes out of business,  then Mkhize will have no competition. What if Mkhize gets greedy and goes back to his bad old ways?\"", "A few days later,  Mr Motaung is getting ready to sell lunch at break time. He's worried. Lately,  fewer and fewer learners are buying from him. Mr Motaung asks himself,  \"Why are they all flocking to Mkhize? What is it that he's doing that I'm not? I thought we were selling the same kota at the same price.\"", "Jabu on his way from Mr Mkhize's shop passes by Mr Motaung's shop. He calls the boy over,  \"Hey Jabu,  how are you? I've not seen you for some time.\"\u00a0 Mr Motaung's eyes are not on Jabu but the kota Jabu is carrying! He realises that the kota has got more chips,  more cheese,  more polony and more atchar! Mr Motaung smiles because he has figured out Mkhize's secret.", "The next time Nomsa and Zodwa are buying kotas,  Mkhize gives them a gift. \"Wait a minute,  I've got a surprise for you. Soon I'll be selling fruit at my shop. Here are some sweet juicy apples to try for free. Please share with your friends.\"", "The girls are delighted. \"Thank you Mr Mkhize!\" they say at the same time. They decide to share the apples with Jabu,  Tebogo and Scelo,  and go to find them in the yard.", "Zodwa tells the boys,  \"Mr Mkhize gave us these apples to share. He wants to sell them at his shop.\"\u00a0Nomsa puts the apples on the bench so that they can all count them. \"Well,\" says Tebogo,  \"we can each have an equal number of apples. But there's one apple left over.\"", "\"Let's cut that remaining apple into three equal parts,\" suggests Jabu. \"What are those equal parts called?\" mutters Nomsa to herself. \"Thirds! Cut the apple into thirds! Three equal parts,\" says Scelo proudly.", "\"No,  let's give that leftover apple to our maths teacher!\" says Zodwa. The friends agree that it's a good suggestion to give the apple to Ms Nkosi after break.", "The next week,  Jabu and Nomsa are waiting for Zodwa at break. Zodwa arrives with her kota. \"Look,  Motaung is back in business!\" she says. Zodwa puts her kota on the bench and the three of them compare the kotas. \"Wow!\" says Jabu,  \"that kota is bigger than a quarter! And look at all those chips!\" \n\n\"I bet this cost a lot extra? How does Mr Motaung make a profit?\" asks Nomsa suspiciously.", "After break,  as they head back to class,  Zodwa takes her friends to read the notice board outside Mr Motaung's shop. Jabu and Nomsa can't believe their eyes when they read the following on the notice: Get your supersize kota! Only R3 more! A third of a loaf with extra chips and extra sauce. With polony OR cheese!"], "Amharic": ["\u1260\u1232\u12eb\u1349\u1295\u12f3 \u12a0\u1295\u12f0\u129b \u12f0\u1228\u1303 \u1275\u121d\u1205\u122d\u1275 \u1264\u1275 \u12e8\u1228\u134d\u1275 \u1220\u12d3\u1275 \u1290\u12cd\u1361\u1361 \u1296\u121d\u1233\u1363 \u1303\u1261\u1293 \u12de\u12f5\u12cb \u12e8\u121a\u1263\u1209 \u120d\u1306\u127d \u12db\u134d \u1325\u120b \u1235\u122d \u121d\u1233 \u1208\u1218\u1265\u120b\u1275 \u1270\u1240\u121d\u1320\u12cb\u120d\u1361\u1361 \u12db\u122c \u1296\u121d\u1233\u1293 \u12de\u12f5\u12cb \u121d\u130d\u1265 \u12a8\u1264\u1273\u1278\u12cd \u12a0\u121d\u1325\u1270\u12cb\u120d\u1361\u1361 \u1303\u1261 \u12a8\u12a0\u1276 \u121b\u12aa\u12dc \u1231\u1245 \u12e8\u1308\u12db\u12cd\u1295 \u12ae\u1273 \u12a5\u12e8\u1260\u120b \u1290\u12cd\u1361\u1361", "\u2039\u2039\u121d\u121d\u121d\u2026 \u12ed\u1205 \u12a0\u12ed\u1265 \u1245\u1263\u1275 \u12a0\u1208\u12cd!

With plenty of love in her heart and her totem in her hand, mother cleared her throat and began the story:\n\nThere was a little girl called Yana. Yana's aunt told her about a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. Yana was curious about that pot. \n\nDid the pot contain gold coins, or lumps of gold in black rocks?", "Yana imagined that if she looked at the sky long enough, she would get some answers.\n\nShe smiled at the birds. She wondered how the gold got into the pot. \n\nAnd, where at the rainbow's end would she find the pot? Yana wished that she knew the exact spot!", "As she thought about her rainbow quest, Yana saw a green frog jumping in the bushes. She could not resist, she jumped around with the frog for a while.\n\nThen, checking the sky, she said goodbye to the frog. Yana went on her way in search for the end of the rainbow.", "She began to think about the rainbow's colours. In a flash, red came first to mind.\n\nShe recalled the day her family almost had a bad accident because a driver didn't stop at a red light. \n\nYana was thankful because no one was badly hurt, although they all had cuts and bruises. Everyone got a huge fright.", "After red, Yana thought of the colour orange. She loved sweet oranges.\n\nSweet, sour and bitter were the tastes she experienced while eating oranges.\n\nThinking about a sour orange made Yana's mouth taste sour! Yuck! Do you know that taste?", "Yana's thoughts moved from oranges to a bowl of dark indigo beans, and her stomach made noises. She realized that she was hungry.\n\nHer rainbow quest would have to wait for a while. It was time to eat some food!", "She ran into her aunt's kitchen. The air carried the aroma of the fried chicken and fresh bread. \n\nYana washed her hands and her nose led her to the food. She ate a little chicken with a large piece of bread, and then she drank water. \n\nShe looked down at her dress. What a mess! Stains from the chicken, and water spilled. So she changed into a beautiful purple dress.", "Later, Yana and her aunt went out to the park together. \n\nThey lay on the grass with a book. Yana eagerly peered into the pages itching to finally know more about the hidden pot of gold.\n\nYana's aunt chuckled at her excitement and they both burst into peals of laughter. They began to read the story together.", "It was a tale about how the rainbow colours came to the land of Tonota, and  a little boy called Mpho. \n\nFor the longest time, the people of Tonota only knew the green of plants and the brown of soil. But Mpho had dreams of clouds in glorious colours! \n\nHe told the elders about his dreams. They said, \"If you name the colours, we can bring them to life.\"", "The elders asked for the help of rainmakers from across the land, and they gathered together.\n\nMpho began thinking about the colours in his dreams. Then, these words came to his mind, \"Red, blue, orange, yellow, purple, green, and indigo.\"\n\nThe colourful clouds filled the sky!", "The clouds hung in the air, and the rainmakers formed a circle, holding hands. The rainmakers looked up to the clouds and the colours formed a beautiful arc. \n\nThis was Tonata's first rainbow! People cheered and rejoiced. \n\nAnd just then, Mpho noticed a pot at the end of the rainbow. A pot filled with gold!", "\"What an amazing rainbow story! Now I know where to find my pot of gold!\" exclaimed Yana to her aunt.\n\nHer aunt smiled, happy she shared her favourite childhood story with her niece. \"But, no more rainbow quests for you! The pot of gold can only be found by accident!\"", "With those words, mother finished her rainbow tale. Udoo, Erdoo and Eryum jumped up and gave her a standing ovation. \n\nThen they held hands like the rainmakers, pretending to make their own rainbow!", "\"Mother, does every land have its own rainbow story?\" asked Erdoo thoughtfully. \n\n\"Yes, my lovelies,\" said mother. \"Tonota's rainbow started with Mpho's dreams of colourful clouds. And remember the Magical Rainbow River and its rainbow ice-cream?\"   \n\n\"Mmmm, rainbow ice-cream, that's my favourite story,\" said Eryum looking at mother hopefully as the children gathered around

You cannot wear the raincoat today. People will laugh at you, if you do.'", "On Tuesday also Mannu kept looking at the sky. And the raincoat was kept right next to him, ready to be used. But the sky was a nice blue and as bright as it was on Monday.Mannu was disappointed,'Mamma, when will I be able to use the raincoat?''There is just a single cloud in the sky today, and that too a white one. I don't think you will get a chance to wear the raincoat today.'Mamma said.", "Wednesday again was a very hot sunny day.Mannu was getting worried, 'Mamma, why is it not raining yet?'He tried to put the raincoat on at home. But had to immediately take it off because he felt too hot in it.Mamma, in her eagerness to comfort him said, 'I think it will rain soon, probably by afternoon.'", "On Thursday, there was the school picnic. Mannu was eager to show off the raincoat to his school buddies.'Mamma, shall I carry the raincoat to the picnic. What if it rains there?' Mannu asked.'Don't, my pet. It will not rain today. See those white clouds? And they are also so far away.' Mamma tried to comfort him.", "And... at last\u00a0 on Friday, the sky looked quite dark with black clouds. Mannu kept the raincoat ready at hand.'Mamma, it will rain today, right mamma?' Mannu asked excitedly. The peacock also seemed to think so and started dancing. The tortoise came out of it's hiding and looked up at the sky hoping perhaps to feel cooler after the hot summer.'I think so. Today the sky is full of black clouds.' Mamma smiled at Mannu's excitement and was happy for him.", "On the Saturday morning there was a loud thunder.\u00a0 And also lightening.'Mamma, it that not lightening? Now it will surely rain, right Mamma?' asked Manu.He ran out on the lawns and saw that a frog and a tortoise also had come out of their hiding.", "And.. tip...tap...tip...tap... came down the raindrops!Mannu, loved the rains...\nraincoat or no raincoat.'Oh, it is raining; it is raining.' Thus shouting\u00a0 Mannu ran out of the house and started\u00a0 \njumping and dancing in the rain.

It was a little dog with white and brown spots. The dog was stuck in a hole and he was scared. \"Don't worry, I won't hurt you. I will help you,\" said Petros.", "Petros helped the dog out of the hole. He barked with joy, dancing around the boy and licking him. \"You are going to be my dog,\" said Petros happily as they continued to the playground.", "The dog ran far ahead. When Petros' friends saw the dog running towards them, they said, \"This dog might be dangerous. It might bite us.\" They picked up stones and threw them at the little dog. Petros was running and shouting for his friends to stop.", "The friends did not hear Petros. The small dog ran as fast as he could to save his life. Then he hid from the boys who were chasing him. They did not find him.", "Petros' friends went back to the playground and found Petros crying. \"What is wrong?\" asked one of them. \"You chased my dog!\" cried Petros. They were shocked and said, \"We didn't know it was your dog. We're sorry. Let's find him.\"", "\"It's no use. We will never find my dog,\" said Petros in a hopeless voice. \"Yes, we will find him. Get up Petros, we will find your dog. We must not lose hope,\" his friends said, consoling him.", "Petros and his friends searched for the dog all afternoon until they got tired. Finally, Petros said, \"There is one last place where the dog could be. If we don't find him there, I will search no more. Let's go to the river.\"", "When the dog saw the boys coming, he was scared. He tried to cross the river but he was scared of the water. He was about to jump into the river, when he heard Petros calling, \"Stop, don't jump!\"", "The dog turned around, saw Petros and ran to him. Petros hugged the dog and the dog licked Petros's face. \"My friend! I thought you were gone forever!\" cried Petros.", "Back at the playground, Petros gave his friends some advice. \"Before you make decisions, think about what could happen as a result.
