Tselane's mother went into his cave. \n\nThe giant drank the beer in one great gulp. Tselane's mother gave him more and more, and more, until the calabash was empty. The giant was soon so drunk that he fell asleep on the floor.", "As soon as Tselane's mother heard the giant's loud snores, she opened the sack lying in the cave. Tselane jumped out of the sack, and they\u00a0ran home as fast as they could. \n\nFrom then on Tselane stayed with her mother at the new village.

Chipego lives with his father, mother and his  little sister Mutinta.  There is one more special member of the family, Pendo the cow. \nChipego helps his father to look after Pendo in exchange for pocket money that he uses to buy books. \nMeet Chipego. He is 10 years old and in Grade 5 at the village school. Chipego always comes top of his class. \"What's his secret?\" his schoolmates ask themselves.\n\n\"He's excellent in reading and writing. How does he do it?\" they wonder. Chipego tells them it is because he reads lots of books. While they waste their time doing nothing, he spends all his free time reading.", "Chipego sometimes earns K80.00 a week in pocket money. He spends most of the pocket money on books at the second-hand book shop in his village.\n\nSo how does Chipego earn enough pocket money for these books? Read on to find out.", "Meet Pendo, the family's milking cow. She produces over 20 litres of milk per day. Chipego's father sells the milk.\n\nA cow needs food and water, and time to graze in the field. So each day after school, Chipego helps with this work. Chipego's father gives him pocket money for the work he does. And it is this money that Chipego saves to buy books each week.", "First, Chipego gives Pendo a bunch of carrots. He gives her exactly eight carrots a day. Each day he picks the carrots from his father's vegetable garden, enough for a day at a time.\n\nYou can work it out. You will find that Pendo eats nearly 60 carrots a week. Can you tell exactly how many?", "After that, Chipego takes Pendo to graze in the fields. His father warned him to watch the time and give Pendo not  more than three quarters of an hour to graze.\n\nPendo usually starts grazing at about14:15 hrs, so that Chipego can take her back to the milking shed at 15 hours. In winter when it gets dark earlier, Chipego may start grazing earlier, around 13:30 hrs.", "Next Chipego gives Pendo water. Without water Pendo won't produce milk, no matter how much Chipego feeds her. Chipego fetches buckets of water from the village pump because there isn't one nearby.\n\nPendo's trough holds about 30 litres of water. Chipego's bucket only holds 5 litres. So to fill the trough Chipego has to make many trips. Can you work out how many trips he has to make?", "Then, Chipego takes Pendo to his father to get her daily 12 kg bag of grain. Chipego calculates that's almost 90 kg a week.\n\nEach bag costs K39.00. Chipego works out the cost of grain for each week. First he works out the cost of 7 bags at K40.00, which makes K280.00 Then he subtracts K7.00 to get K273.00 \"That's over K1 000 a month!\" Chipego estimates. Is he correct?", "Chipego's father milks Pendo twice a day. She produces about 24 litres of milk a day, so about 12 litres for each milking.\n\nSometimes Chipego helps with the milking but it is not as easy as it looks. \"One day,\" he thinks to himself, \"I will have my own cows and I will have to do all the milking myself.\"", "His father pours the milk from the big bucket into smaller two litre cans or one litre bottles. He then sells the milk for K8.00 a litre.\n\nOnce a week Chipego's father donates 25 litres of milk to Bulela School feeding scheme. Each child gets a quarter litre of this milk. That means that 100 children get milk on this day.", "For each litre of milk sold, his father gives Chipego 50 ngwee. That doesn't sound like a lot, but if his father sells 24 litres a day, it adds up to quite a bit. Can you tell how much?\n\nChipego saves his money until Saturday when he makes a trip to the book shop. Each book costs less than k10.00, so in a good week, he can buy quite a few.", "Chipego also loves to drink Pendo's milk. His father says that milk helps to build strong bones and teeth and makes a person fit and healthy.\n\nSo by drinking milk and eating lots of vegetables from his father's garden, Chipego is strong and healthy. He seldom gets sick and never goes hungry. His mother loves making mabisi using Pendo's milk too. His young sister enjoys adding the milk to her chibwantu! Hmmm! Yummy!", "Chipego never forgets to thank Pendo at the end of each day. He rewards her with extra carrots or spinach leaves that he finds lying around the garden.\n\n\"Thank you Pendo, you are my best friend! It is thanks to you that I am strong, healthy and clever. If not for you I would never be able to buy all the books that help me be top of my class.\" One day I will be a veterinary  doctor because of you!\nPendo is very lucky because Mutinta, Chipego's mother and Father also rewards her!

Sometimes its cake or chocolate,  or she buys long sweets that look like snakes. Sometimes it's apples,  pears or oranges. Mama K has only one rule. \"Share it fair!\" The children know they must share the treats equally,  so they all get the same amount.", "Today Mama K has baked a round strawberry cake with pink icing and berries from her garden. The children wait on the grass for their treat. \"Here you go!\" smiles Mama K. \"But remember the rule. Everyone must get the same. Share it fair! Don't fight!\"", "Maya has the first turn to share the cake. She uses the knife to trace lines in the icing. The others watch her. She does not cut the cake yet.

Now we have three slices,  all the same!\" Maya shows them.", "\"No way!\" says Duksie,  \"the one in the middle is much too big!\" Doobie also shakes his head. Maya laughs and shrugs and tells Duksie to try.", "\"Here! Pass me the knife,  I'll do it. Easy peasy!\" chants Duksie. First she rubs out Maya's pattern in the icing and licks her fingers.", "Then she makes one cut across and one down. \"Look,  I made my three slices!\" \"That's not fair!\" shout Maya and Doobie together.", "\"Share it fair! The pieces must be the same size and shape,\" adds Doobie. \"Why don't you try Doobie,  Smarty Pants?\" smirks Duksie. \"I bet you can't do it!\"", "\"I wish the cake was a square or a rectangle,  and then it would be easy!\" says Doobie thoughtfully. \"Or,  if there were four of us to share the round cake that would also be easy,\" says Maya.", "And then! A picture comes into Doobie's head. He sees the sparkling silver badge at the front of his father's big red truck. On Sundays he helps his dad to wash the truck,  and to polish the shiny badge. \"I've got it! I've got it! I know how to do it,\" yells Doobie.", "First he uses a knife to smooth Duksie's lines in the icing. Then he traces three lines on the cake. It looks just like the badge on his dad's truck,  with three equal parts.", "\"You are full of surprises,  Doobie,\" says Duksie sweetly. \"How did you work it out?\" Maya asks. \n\nDoobie smiles to himself. For now it is his secret. Later, he will tell his dad.", "Just then Mama K comes out of her house. She is carrying a tray with three glasses of cold strawberry juice. \"Look Mama K! Doobie found the way to cut the cake into three equal pieces,\" Maya tells her. \"Well done Doobie,  three equal slices! You shared fairly,  I'm proud of you all. Now cut the cake and drink your juice. It's time to go home. I will give you plates to take your pieces of cake.\"", "Maya cuts along Doobie's lines to make three equal slices. Just for fun,  the children stack the slices on top of each other to check that they are the same size. Yes they are!", "\u00a0 Doobie's dad arrives to pick up the children,  and Doobie runs off to meet him.
