Mother Monkey hid in a tree and watched them. She was afraid that this baby would also die, like the others.
Then the hunter's wife saw her children playing with the little monkey. She said, "Be careful! Bring it here. You will drop it!"
She took the baby monkey in her arms, and blessed it.
The hunter's wife put the baby monkey down. Mother Monkey picked the baby up and disappeared into the forest. Mother Monkey never lost another baby from then on.

Petros' friends chased the dog. "Stop! Stop!" Petros shouted.
The dog ran away. He hid from the bad boys.
The friends found Petros crying. They said, "Let's find your dog."
Petros had no hope. His friends said, "We will find him."
They looked everywhere. Petros said, "He must be at the river."
The dog was afraid of the boys. Petros called, "Don't jump!"

Everyone knows that the elephant has a very long nose.
But a long time ago, the elephant's nose was short and fat. Like a shoe in the middle of its face.
One day a baby elephant was born. She was curious about everything. She had a question for every animal.
She was curious about Giraffe. "Why do you have a long neck?" she asked.
She was curious about Rhino. "Why does your horn have a sharp point?"
She was curious about Hippo. "Why do you have red eyes?" she asked.
And she was VERY curious about Crocodile. "What does Crocodile eat for dinner?" she asked.
"Never ask a question like that!" said her mother. Then she walked off, frowning.
Quickly Crow flew down to Baby Elephant. "Follow me to the river. There you will see what Crocodile eats for dinner," squawked Crow.
So the baby elephant followed Crow down to the river.
She pushed through the reeds and stood on the bank. She looked into the water. Where was Crocodile?
"Hello," said a stone near the river bank. "Hello," said Baby Elephant. "Can you tell me what Crocodile eats for dinner?" she asked.
"Bend down and I will tell you," said the stone. "Lower, lower," said the stone. So Baby Elephant bent down lower, and lower.
Then suddenly, "Snap!" Baby Elephant's nose was caught in Crocodile's jaws. "Crocodile will eat you for dinner!" squawked Crow, and flew away.
Baby Elephant sat back on her strong legs and pulled. She pulled, and pulled. But Crocodile did not let go of her nose.
Baby Elephant's nose stretched, and stretched, and stretched. Then, "Thud!" she fell on her back.
Crocodile sunk back into the water. He was cross about losing his dinner.
Baby Elephant looked at her nose. It was stretched very long. She could not see where it ended!
Her nose was so long she could pick fruit from high branches.
Her nose was so long she could shower her back with water. From that day, all elephants had long and useful trunks.
Era uma vez, um homem rico que tinha dois filhos. O homem rico escreveu em seu testamento que o primeiro filho ficaria com todas as suas vacas. E só um galo deveria ir para o seu segundo filho.
Então, depois que o homem morreu, seu primeiro filho ganhou todas as vacas. E o segundo filho só recebeu um galo.
Depois de um tempo, o filho rico ficou doente. Ele foi ao curandeiro para perguntar o que ele deveria fazer para melhorar. O curandeiro disse, "Você deveria abater um galo de uma cor especial."
O filho rico não sabia onde conseguir um galo de uma cor especial. Então ele lembrou do galo de seu irmão. Ele mandou algumas pessoas ao seu irmão.
O irmão disse a eles, "Tudo que eu tenho é este galo. Mas se ele pode fazer meu irmão melhorar, prefiro perder o galo." Ele generosamente deu o galo.
As pessoas o abateram e deram de comer para o irmão doente. O irmão se recuperou de sua doença.
Depois de um tempo a coisa mais curiosa aconteceu. No corpo do irmão rico começou a crescer penas.
Ele não podia acreditar no que estava vendo.
Ele foi aos anciões. Eles disseram, "Esse é o resultado de ter sido injusto com seu irmão. Você pegou todas as vacas e o galo que seu pai deixou para ele." Os anciões disseram ao irmão, "Para melhorar seu irmão deve perdoá-lo."
Os anciões continuaram, "Vamos pegar esta pulseira como um sinal de perdão e dar a seu irmão. Se ele cuspir nela, você será curado."
Os anciãos levaram a pulseira para o irmão e disseram, "Cuspa nela e perdoe seu irmão." O irmão cuspiu na pulseira.
Como resultado, os anciões decidiram dar metade das vacas do irmão rico para o irmão pobre.
There was a boy whose name was Abel. He made himself a cart.Abel had no driver for his new cart. He said to his sister Meri, "I want a driver for my cart. Please give me your doll. She can sit in the cart."
But Meri said, "No, I want my doll." When Meri would not let him take the doll, Abel was very angry. He grabbed the doll and pulled her. Meri pulled the doll's other arm. Abel pulled and Meri pulled. The doll's arm came off!
Meri cried and ran to her mother. "Look Mother," she said, "Abel pulled my doll's arm and it came off. He wanted my doll to sit in his new cart but I wanted to play with her."Her mother said, "Abel did not behave well."
Mother thought about how to teach her son not to touch his sister's toys. She had an idea.She went to her friend who was a doctor and she asked, "I want you to help me please." The doctor replied, "How can I help, my friend?"
Mother answered, "My son Abel is behaving badly these days. He pulled the arm off his sister's doll. He must not do that.Tomorrow I will tell him to bring the doll to you to put the doll's arm on again."
"Please tell Abel that he must pay you for your work. He doesn't have any money, so you will tell him to clean your big old car that is always dusty," said mother.Her friend laughed and said, "Ee–ee! That will be good."
Abel's mother went back to her house. She asked Abel, "When you are ill or hurt where do you go?" Abel answered, "When I am ill or hurt, I must go to the doctor."Abel's mother said, "You hurt the doll, now you must take her to the doctor."
So Abel took the doll to the doctor. "This doll is hurt very badly. My mother told me to bring the doll to you. Doctor, can you give her a new arm?"The doctor agreed to look after the doll. She was able to make a new arm.
The doctor said to Abel, "The doll has a new arm. You must pay me. How much money do you have?"Abel answered, "Please doctor, I don't have any money. I can't pay you for your work."
The doctor said, "Well! You don't have any money? My big car is very dirty! Clean my car and that is how you will pay me."Abel got a bucket of water and a clean cloth. It took a long time to wash that dirty car.
Then Abel took the doll back to Meri. She was delighted and she said to Abel, "You are a good brother. Thank you for fixing my doll.""My sister, I'm sorry for getting angry and making you sad," said Abel.
From that day, Abel never took his sister's things again. And he tried his best not to get angry with her.Abel remembered how long it took him to wash the doctor's big, dirty car. He decided it wasn't worth the price to get angry and break things.

Nebanda normally combs her hair nicely before she lives for any function.
Tabo has cut his hair.
Mubbalya has shaved his hair off.
Long time ago, there lived an orphan boy called Pasitau. Pasitau's parents were killed by robbers when he was only six months old. As the villagers mourned the death of Pasitau's parents, they wondered what would become of the young boy.
After the burial, Sausau, the village headman called a meeting. Sausau was respected and feared at the same time because of the way he dressed and talked. His hair was long and fell on his back. It was believed that Sausau lived in the forest long before trees were cut down and houses were built.
During the meeting, Lokeyokoni, a very rich villager, adopted Pasitau. Lokeyokoni had many sons and daughters. The daughters helped their mother with household chores while the sons went out to graze their father's big herd of cattle.
Pasitau grew up in this family and was very happy. He was loved and he loved everybody. He enjoyed grazing the animals in the fields.
Pasitau loved one particular cow so much that he gave it the name 'Sitau'. Sitau was the oldest cow in the whole herd. For this reason, the owner valued it a lot.
One day, when the boys were out grazing the animals, it started raining and they had to shelter under a tree. The rain fell for many hours until it was dark. When it eventually stopped raining, the boys went to collect the animals and take them home but there were no animals to be seen.
They were afraid of what their father would do to them if they arrived home without the animals. When they could not trace the cattle, two boys decided to go to their uncle's home while two others went to their aunt's place. Pasitau decided to continue looking for the animals till he found them. He had no uncle or aunt to run to.
Pasitau followed all the tracks that he knew while singing the name of his favourite cow. This is how the song went: Piii pi Sitau! Piii pi Sitau! Chaka akula chi! Chaka orete chi!
Pasitau went on singing the song throughout the night. He stepped on the cow dung but it was cold. He then stepped on the urine but it was cold as well. Pasitau did not give up.
At dawn, Pasitau reached a small village and found the animals in the care of the village headman. He pleaded with the headman to let him lead the animals home, but the headman refused.
Frustrated, Pasitau started singing his song as he turned to go home. It was then that Sitau, the oldest cow, heard Pasitau. Sitau raised her ears and started following Pasitau. All the animals broke from the enclosure and followed Pasitau. He lead them home.
When they reached home, villagers were waiting because they had heard Pasitau's voice from far. They all sang songs praising Pasitau. Lokeyokoni thanked Pasitau and bought him a red bag for carrying books to school. And that is how Pasitau started going to school.

The giant asked the girl loved by both parents to help her carry firewood. So the girl followed the giant.
They walked for some distance. The girl asked the giant, "Where is your firewood?" The giant replied, "It is near those trees over there!"
When they reached the trees, the girl asked again, "Where is your firewood?" The giant answered, "Not far now!"
They met a man along the way. He asked the giant, "What is the name of your child?" The giant replied, "She is called the talking bag."
The girl burst out and sang: I am not called the talking bag. My name is Kaamungei! Oh! My mother, whom I love. Oh! My father, whom I love. Oh! My calabash, which I use to drink milk!
When the man heard what the girl sang, he rescued her and took her back to her parents.The story ends there!

There is a big boy who takes care of us with many other dogs, his name is Robin. He takes us for walk, to the vet and more. I am a bloodhound, so whenever he loses things in the fields, I help him!
Many times people come and buy the dogs from Robin and give him a card or some paper, (they call it cash.) He gives them the chosen dog after they pay.
Today a boy and a girl came with their parents to pick a dog. They finally picked me! I was Robin's favourite dog, they couldn't take me! But Robin had to give me, he told them "He's a special dog, take good care of him."
I am now with them for the past few months, they are a great family. I run with them, they feed me and I find their lost things. I still miss Robin, I want to see him. I will hopefully see him again.
My village has goats. It is far from big cities.
Mother said, "Zainab, we have a present for your sixth birthday."
Mother, aunt and I waited for the bus.
I sat on mother’s lap. I slept the whole way.
We reached the market. I saw a beautiful blue helicopter.
One stall had fruits. I asked mother, “Which ones are these?”
Mother said, “These are apples.” I begged, “Please, buy me one.”
I forgot my mother’s hand. I thought only of my apple.
When I finished eating, I was alone. I started to cry.
A woman took me where there were other children.
I thought children were sold at the market. I cried more.
A man asked, "Where is Zainab?"I hid away from him.
My mother's familiar voice called, "Zainab!" I was very happy.
My aunt pulled out a beautiful helicopter. "It's yours!" she said.
A poor farmer had an old ox that didn't like to work. The ox didn't want to plough the farmer's field. He wanted to stay at home and eat grass, drink water and rest.
The farmer had a donkey, too. The donkey and the ox were friends. At the end of the day, the ox and the donkey talked to each other. "I'm so tired," the ox said. "I worked hard all day. The plough is big and heavy. The farmer never lets me rest."
The donkey thought, "The ox is lazy. He doesn't like to work." He cried, "Do you think your plough is heavy? Believe me, my friend, it is light! I carried a sack of grain on my back today. It was heavier than your plough, I am sure."
The next day, the two animals met again. "I had a bad day today," the ox said. "My master's field is far away, and it was full of stones. I worked hard all day. I didn't have any rest."
"You worked hard?" asked the donkey. "Today I travelled many kilometres to the market in the town. I'm sure I worked harder than you."
The next day, the ox came home late again. "Oh, my friend," he said to the donkey. "Today was a very bad day for me."But the donkey didn't want to listen to the ox any more.
He said, "You're always tired. When the farmer comes, lie down and say, 'Moo! Moo!' He will think that you are ill. He will let you rest."The ox liked the donkey's idea. "Thank you, dear donkey, that's a very good idea," he said.
The next morning, the ox lay down and closed his eyes. "Moo! Moo!" he said.The farmer looked at him. "My poor old ox is sick," he said. "But I must plough my field. Who will help me? Perhaps the donkey! He can pull the plough today."
The farmer tied the plough to the donkey, and began to hit him with his whip. "Go on! Faster! Pull!" he called out to the donkey.The donkey worked hard all day, and in the evening he was very tired.
The donkey slowly walked home. The ox said, "Dear donkey, I had a lovely day today. I ate some grass, drank some water and I rested. I want to rest again tomorrow. Give me another idea."
The donkey thought, "His work is much worse than mine. I don't want to do it again tomorrow." The donkey said, "Be careful. The farmer said 'My ox is always tired and now he is sick. If he is not better tomorrow, I will kill him, and we can eat the meat.'"
The ox was very frightened. He cried, "Really? Did he say that? Then I will work tomorrow. I feel quite better now. I'm not tired at all!"
Fana and her family live in Debre Birhan, a busy town in Ethiopia. Fana is a Grade 3 student. She is good-hearted and wise.
Fana loves animals. She has a cat, two hens, a goat and a dove. She spends time with these animals, feeding them, and playing with them.
One day, Fana was playing in the school yard with her friends when she saw children throwing stones at doves. “Why are they hurting the doves?” She asked herself.
She stopped playing and ran towards the children throwing stones. At first her friends didn't understand what was happening, then theyfollowed her. “Stop throwing stones,” shouted Fana.
The other children ran away. Fana caught the two injured doves. She saw wounds on their wings. She decided to take the two doves home to look after them.
She fed the doves. In the evening she told her family what she saw and did during the day, and how she saved the doves.
In the morning Fana and her parents went to the clinic and got medicine for the doves. After a few days, the doves' wounds healed. Fana felt very happy.
Fana always tells her friends, “I love animals. Animals are useful to us and they are our friends. We must protect and preserve them.”
Long long ago people didn't know anything. They didn't know how to plant crops, or how to weave cloth,  or how to make iron tools. The god Nyame up in the sky had all the wisdom of the world. He kept it safe in a clay pot.
One day, Nyame decided that he would give the pot of wisdom to Anansi. Every time Anansi looked in the clay pot, he learned something new. It was so exciting!
Greedy Anansi thought, "I'll keep the pot safe at the top of a tall tree. Then I can have it all to myself!" He spun a long thread, wound it round the clay pot, and tied it to his stomach. He began to climb the tree. But it was hard climbing the tree with the pot bumping him in the knees all the time.
All the time Anansi's young son had been standing at the bottom of the tree watching. He said, "Wouldn't it be easier to climb if you tied the pot to your back instead?" Anansi tried tying the clay pot full of wisdom to his back, and it really was a lot easier.
In no time he reached the top of the tree. But then he stopped and thought, "I'm supposed to be the one with all the wisdom, and here my son was cleverer than me!" Anansi was so angry about this that he threw the clay pot down out of the tree.
It smashed into pieces on the ground. The wisdom was free for everyone to share. And that is how people learned to farm, to weave cloth, to make iron tools, and all the other things that people know how to do.
For many months, the skies were dry. Lomongin, the famous rain-maker, talked to his gods. People gathered outside his home, anxiously waiting for a message of hope.
When he came out, he assured people that the creator was going to give them rain soon. They would be able to plant their crops.
Children played outside as we waited for the rains. Later that day, we saw big white clouds in the far east. I knew they were rain clouds.
People were still thinking about what the rain-maker said. Mother shouted loudly, “There! The clouds are now dark. Come inside.”
The rain poured down.
We had waited for the rains! At first we rejoiced. But the rains did not stop.
There was water everywhere. The bridge linking our village to the mainland was washed away.
Houses were washed away by floods. What was a blessing, was now a disaster for us.
Everybody had prepared for planting. But now they could not plant. People of my village had longed for rain but now they did not want it anymore. We had no bridge to cross on. Many had no homes.
And, we had another problem! We saw crocodiles swimming everywhere. This had never happened before. We were confused.
We could not go shopping because all the shops were across the river. Children couldn't go to school because schools were across the river.
What should have been a blessing, became a curse to us. Lomongin, the rainmaker, was disappointed as well. The only one who was happy, was Kapuus with his eight cats!
A long time ago,  there lived a man called Mulongo and his wife Nambuya. They had two children,  Mukhwana and Namono. There was a famine in the land where they lived. All the villagers,  including Mulongo and his family,  would leave their homes early to look for food in the forest.
One day,  Mulongo,  his wife and children decided to go deep in the forest in search of something to eat. From morning to evening they looked for food but they found nothing. Nambuya urged her husband to go further into the forest. Mulongo led the way as Nambuya and the two children followed.
Suddenly Mulongo saw a beautiful banana plantation. He called his wife and said,  "Is that not a banana plantation? I can see bananas and other food crops. I wonder whose it is." They moved on and soon saw a house in the middle of the plantation. They stopped,  looked in all directions,  but there was no one around. Because they were hungry and it was nearly night time,  they decided to sit and wait for the owner.
Suddenly they heard heavy breathing close to the house. They were frightened to see a huge ogre arrive. "Who are you and what do you want?" asked the ogre in a fearful voice. Mulongo in a trembling voice said,  "We came looking for food because there is famine in our place." The ogre gave them food.
For several days the ogre allowed Mulongo and his family to eat his crops without asking for anything in return. One morning,  however,  the ogre said to Nambuya,  "I want you to cook your son for me to eat when I come back this evening." When the ogre had gone Mulongo went into the bush and killed some small animals,  which he asked his wife to cook for the ogre. Meanwhile he asked Mukhwana to climb up a leafy mango tree and hide.
In the evening the ogre returned and asked,  "Have you cooked Mukhwana for me?" Mulongo's wife answered,  "Yes." She gave the ogre the meat and he greedily ate everything. Then he said,  "Tomorrow you cook your daughter."
The following morning Mulongo and his wife did as they had done on the first day. Namono was hidden up the mango tree. When the ogre returned he said,  "Did you cook Namono?" Again,  Nambuya told the ogre that she had done so.
After eating,  the ogre instructed Nambuya to cook her husband Mulongo,  the next day. Nambuya was perturbed but Mulongo said he would go out again and catch some animals to cook. He did that and after giving the meat to his wife,  he also climbed up the mango tree to hide.
At dusk the ogre came back. Nambuya gave the meat to the ogre who enjoyed it very much. He told Nambuya,  "Tomorrow cook yourself." When the ogre had left Nambuya called her husband to advise her. Mulongo said,  "Go and look for some small animals and cook them for the ogre. When everything is ready,  come up the tree where we are."
The ogre came back in the afternoon and started eating his tasty evening meal of sweet meat. He felt sleepy,  went to lie under the mango tree and began snoring. But not so long after,  the ogre woke up because he heard noises above him. The ogre looked up to the tree and saw Mulongo and his wife and children.
The ogre was very angry. "So you deceived me? Let me come and get you," he shouted. As the ogre was struggling to climb up the tree,  Mulongo quickly thought of a trick and said,  "It will be easier for you to reach us if you tie a rope around your neck and we help to pull you up."
The ogre ran into the house,  brought a strong rope and after tying it around his neck he threw the other end of the rope to Mulongo. Mulongo and his wife and children started pulling the ogre up as they twisted the rope. The rope soon tightened around the ogre's neck until he could not breathe and died. Mulongo and his family came down the tree and took over the ogre's house and property.
A long time ago, in the village of Nyamani, there lived a man known as Kiundu. Kiundu liked to eat very much. He especially liked to eat meat.
One day, the chief of the village invited all the villagers to his son's wedding.
Then Kiundu heard people talking about another wedding party. It was in a nearby village calledKatumbi. “Two parties on the same day!” Kiundu thought.
“I must attend both parties,” Kiundu said to himself. “I will first walk to Katumbi and then come back to Nyamani.”
Kiundu woke up early in the morning and walked to Katumbi village. When he arrived he saw that thecooks were still preparing the food. “I will go back to Nyamani and return here later,” Kiundu decided.
Kiundu walked back to Nyamani hoping to find the meat ready. He was now hungry. But when he arrived, people there were also still preparing the food.
“When I left Katumbi they were starting to cook,” he thought. “The food must be ready now.” So Kiunduwalked back to Katumbi. He was now very hungry.
By the time Kiundu got to Katumbi, people had already eaten. Guests were giving presents to the bride and the groom. Kiundu did not have a gift to give. He only wanted to eat.
Kiundu was most disappointed about missing the food. He decided to walk back to Nyamani village. He was hungry and tired and walked very slowly.
When he arrived at Nyamani village, people were singing and dancing. They had already eaten all the food!
When he heard that there was no food, Kiundu fainted. He had missed meat from both parties. When he recovered, he got some porridge in a small cup!
Kiundu walked home again, still hungry.

A poor farmer had an old ox that didn't like to work. The ox didn't want to plough the farmer's field. He wanted to stay at home and eat grass, drink water and rest.
The farmer had a donkey, too. The donkey and the ox were friends. At the end of the day, the ox and the donkey talked to each other. “I'm so tired,” the ox said. “I worked hard all day. The plough is big and heavy. The farmer never lets me rest.”
The donkey thought, “The ox is lazy. He doesn't like to work.” He cried, “Do you think your plough is heavy? Believe me, my friend, it is light! I carried a sack of grain on my back today. It was heavier than your plough, I am sure.”
The next day, the two animals met again. “I had a bad day today,” the ox said. “My master's field is far away, and it was full of stones. I worked hard all day. I didn't have any rest.”
“You worked hard?” asked the donkey. “Today I travelled many kilometres to the market in the town. I'm sure I worked harder than you.”
The next day, the ox came home late again. “Oh, my friend,” he said to the donkey. “Today was a very bad day for me.” But the donkey didn't want to listen to the ox any more.
He said, “You're always tired. When the farmer comes, lie down and say, 'Moo! Moo!' He will think that you are ill. He will let you rest.” The ox liked the donkey's idea. “Thank you, dear donkey, that's a very good idea,” he said.
The next morning, the ox lay down and closed his eyes. “Moo! Moo!” he said. The farmer looked at him. “My poor old ox is sick,” he said.“ But I must plough my field. Who will help me? Perhaps the donkey! He can pull the plough today.”
The farmer tied the plough to the donkey, and began to hit him with his whip. “Go on! Faster! Pull!” he called out to the donkey. The donkey worked hard all day, and in the evening he was very tired.
The donkey slowly walked home. The ox said, “Dear donkey, I had a lovely day today. I ate some grass, drank some water and I rested. I want to rest again tomorrow. Give me another idea.”
The donkey thought, “His work is much worse than mine. I don't want to do it again tomorrow.” The donkey said, “Be careful. The farmer said 'My ox is always tired and now he is sick. If he is not better tomorrow, I will kill him, and we can eat the meat.'”
The ox was very frightened. He cried, “Really? Did he say that? Then I will work tomorrow. I feel quite better now. I'm not tired at all!”
Goat was king of animals and birds. He called a meeting.
Goat told them that he had a dream. They all listened.
The dream was about hunger. "What shall we do?" asked Cat.
Hen and Duck said, "Let's keep food in the king's store."
King Goat said, "Tie up anyone who does not obey."
The time came to choose a new king. They chose Cat.
Goat did not want Cat as king. "I am the king," Goat said angrily.
Goat did not take food. Cow asked, "What shall we do?"
The animals and birds talked together. They were angry with Goat.
Dog said, "I was always with him when he was king."
Sheep said, "I gave his children my beautiful wool when he was king."
Pig cried, "When he was king, I looked after his garden."
"Did Goat think he will be king forever?" Sheep  asked.
The animals agreed that Goat must take food to king Cat.
The animals found Goat relaxing. Goat said, "I will always be king."
"We will tie you and take you to the new king."
Cow pulled Goat to the king's court. Others cheered.
That's why goats refuse to move when they are pulled.
Once upon a time,  there was a hardworking farmer. He had a hardworking wife,  and two sons.
He had enough food because he and his wife worked very hard. He wanted his children to have a good life. He never let them do any work.
After some time,  his wife died.
The man still did not want his children to work. He did the field labour and all the housework too.
But as time went on,  the man became old and sick. He started to worry about what would become of his children when he died. They would not be able to take care of themselves.
He called his sons. He said,  "My inheritance to you is a lot of gold hidden in the fields. So,  it's up to you to plough them and find the gold."
He also called his neighbours and said,  "I'm going to die soon. My sons do not know how to look after themselves. Please look after them until they can do it for themselves."
After the man died,  the neighbours provided his sons with food for some time.
The brothers did not want to be robbed of the gold their father buried. They decided to do the digging themselves.
They dug one field after another,  but they did not find any gold.
They sat down and one asked the other,  "Do you think our father cheated us?" The other brother said,  "No,  I think our father was saying that farming is gold. And if we dig the fields,  plant,  and plough we can become rich."
So,  like all the other farmers,  they dug up the fields. They grew wheat and became very rich.
All the class students got a topic from their class teacher to discuss. It was about 'What would you like to become when you grow up?' Everyone went into deep thoughts about their aim. They had never thought about it earlier.
Riya looked at the sky and said, "I will be a pilot".
John Looked at Sam and shouted, "You are so flexible Sam. Why don't you become an Athlete?" Others Screamed with the agreement.
Chintu got an idea while sliding down the giraffe slide. He said, "I will become a vet. I love animals."
Seema was the best skater in her class. She said proudly, "I will become the world's famous skater and win a gold medal."
Now all the children new their dream. They discussed with each other and went to the evening fair happily.
Hungry Jackal was hunting.
He chased a mouse. The mouse hid under a big rock.
Jackal dug. The rock fell on his paw.
Rabbit heard Jackal calling. He ran to see what happened.
Rabbit agreed to help Jackal. Jackal promised to give Rabbit food.
Rabbit pushed the rock. The rock rolled off Jackal's paw.
Rabbit asked for his reward.Jackal threatened to eat him!
Jackal and Rabbit found an old man to judge their case.
Jackal threatened to eat the old man too!
The man said, “Let me see the rock before I decide.”
Jackal and Rabbit took the man to the rock.
Jackal explained how the rock fell on his paw.
The man asked Rabbit to show how he pushed the rock.
Rabbit pushed. The rock was back on Jackal's paw.
The man said, “Now it is fair. Let us go home.”
The man and Rabbit went. Jackal was left trapped.
Once upon a time,  there lived a man called Mairu in Bubaali Village. He liked to eat meat so much.
One day,  the chairman of Bubaali village invited all the villagers to his wedding that was to take place at his home.
Then Mairu also heard that there was another wedding in Nabuyanja village. "Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!Two parties on the same day!" Mairu imagined.
"Ha! Ha! Ha! I must attend both parties," he said. "I will first walk to Bubaali then come back to Nabuyanja."
Mairu woke up very early in the morning and walked to Bubaali village. He looked around and saw that the party had not yet started. "I will go back to Nabuyanja and return to Bubaali later," Mairu told himself. "Yes! Yes! I hope I will not be late."
Mairu walked gently back to Bubaali hoping to find the meat, rice, sodas and matooke ready. He was now very hungry. When he arrived,  men and women were still preparing the food.
"I left cooks at Bubaali preparing to cook," he thought. "The food must be ready now." Mairu decided to walk back to Nabuyanja under hot sunshine,  i will not loose hope he added!
Mairu arrived at the Bubaali party,  people had already eaten and cleaned the utensils. Guests were giving presents to the bride and the groom. Mairu was very disappointed. He looked displaced and every one became concerned. But his target was to eat enough.
He decided to walk back to Nabuyanja village. Because he was hungry and tired,  he could not walk fast any more.
When he arrived at Nabuyanja village,  the food was over and it was time for the bride and groom giving a speech.
Upon hearing that there was no food,  Mairu fell and fainted. He had missed meat from both parties. All he got was some posho and beans on a small plate yet his target was to eat meat.
Gently, he walked back home cursing never to serve two masters at ago.

At break-time,the elephant followed Lindi to the playground.He knocked overthe swings by mistake.“Go away!” saidLindi. “You’re not real and you shouldn’t be here! Everybody knows that!”The elephantdrooped. He walked away, wiping his eyes with his trunk.
After school,Lindi couldn’t see the elephant anywhere.“Elephant!” shecalled. “Where are you?”
Lindi went homewithout him. She felt lonely.So she wentoutside, and sat on the steps, and waited.And waited. Andwaited.
And then … She sawa trunk. And tusks.And ears.The elephant wascoming down the road!
She ran up andhugged him.“I’m sorry,” shesaid. “I didn’t mean it!I know you’rereal. You’re my elephant.”The elephant lifted her up and put her on his back, and she rode down the street.
She waved to herneighbours.“Hello, Mr Green!Hello, Mrs Green!”“Look at Lindi!”said Mr Green. “How did she get up there? Maybe she grew!”“Don’t be silly,”said Mrs Green. “Little girls don’t grow that high. Everybody knows that.”

“Elephants arethe best friends in the world,” Lindi said to herself. “Nobody knows that, except for me and my elephant.”
A long time ago,  three girls went out to collect wood.
It was a hot day so they went down to the river to swim. They played and splashed and swam in the water.
Suddenly,  they realised that it was late. They hurried back to the village.
When they were nearly home,  Nozibele put her hand to her neck. She had forgotten her necklace! "Please come back with me!" she begged her friends. But her friends said it was too late.
Nozibele went back to the river alone. She found her necklace and began hurrying home. But,  she got lost in the dark.
In the distance she saw light coming from a hut. She walked quickly towards it and knocked at the door.
To her surprise,  a dog opened the door and said,  "What do you want?" "I'm lost and I need a place to sleep," said Nozibele. "Come in,  or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele went in.
The dog said,  "Cook for me!" "But I've never cooked for a dog before," Nozibele answered. "Cook,  or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele cooked some food for the dog.
Then the dog said,  "Make the bed for me!" Nozibele answered,  "I've never made a bed for a dog." "Make the bed,  or I'll bite you!" the dog said. Nozibele made the bed.
Every day she had to cook and sweep and wash for the dog. Then one day the dog said,  "Nozibele,  today I have to visit some friends. Sweep the house,  cook the food and wash my things before I come back."
As soon as the dog had gone,  Nozibele took three hairs from her head. She put one hair under the bed,  one behind the door,  and one in the kraal. Then she ran home as fast as she could.
When the dog came back,  he looked for Nozibele. "Nozibele,  where are you?" he shouted. "I'm here,  under the bed," said the first hair. "I'm here,  behind the door," said the second hair. "I'm here,  in the kraal," said the third hair.
The dog knew that Nozibele had tricked him. He ran and ran all the way to the village. But Nozibele's brothers were waiting there with big sticks. The dog turned and ran away and has never been seen since.

Mod the toad was tired of living in water.
"Be careful," said the turtle. "Your skin will dry out."
But Mod was curious. She hopped away.
She looked all around.
She met a purple chameleon next to a puddle of water.
The chameleon started turning pink! Mod jumped away.
Then she saw a hyena starting a fire.
The fire spread around Mod. She was afraid.
The fire burned her skin. She jumped back, into the puddle.
But her skin was already full of blisters.

Now only frogs have smooth skin and live near water.
Long time ago, Hare and Hyena were good friends.
Hare said to Hyena, “Let us do farming together.”
Hare suggested that they should plant maize and share duties.
Hare told Hyena, “My work of chasing birds is difficult.”
Hyena agreed to till the land alone.
When Hyena pulled out weeds, Hare sat down singing.
When the maize was ready, Hare enjoyed chasing birds away.
Hare said, “I harvest above the soil. You harvest below.”
Hare harvested all the maize and stored it.
Hyena found only roots under the soil.
Hyena realised that he was cheated. He was angry.
They planted potatoes. Hyena said, “I will harvest above the soil.”
They worked on the farm together, singing.
At harvest time, Hyena harvested only potato leaves.
Hare harvested a lot of big potatoes and stored them.
Hyena chased Hare to get revenge. Their friendship ended.

Andiswa watched the boys play soccer. She wished that she could join them. She asked the coach if she could practise with them.
The coach put his hands on his hips. "At this school,  only boys are allowed to play soccer," he said.
The boys told her to go and play netball. They said that netball is for girls and soccer is for boys. Andiswa was upset.
The next day, the school had a big soccer match. The coach was worried because his best player was sick and could not play.
Andiswa begged the coach, "Please, let me play." The coach was not sure what to do. Then he decided that Andiswa could join the team.

There was a man called Lodipo. He lived with his two wives, Akai and Akitela.
Lodipo's first wife, Akai, was the only one who helped his blind mother.
One day, Lodipo's younger wife, Akitela, said, "Let us move away to a safer place." The place where they lived was constantly attacked by cattle raiders. Akitela felt unsafe.
Lodipo told Akitela that his blind mother did not want to move. Akitela insisted that they should move, and leave Lodipos' mother behind. "If we don't move away from here, I will return to my parents," Akitela cried to Lodipo.
Lodipo loved Akitela very much so he gave in to her demands. They prepared to leave. The first wife, Akai, watched all this happening with confusion.
Lodipo's blind mother sat on a goat skin under a tree. She was unaware of what was going on. "How can we leave her on her own?" Akai wondered to herself.
Lodipo and his wives loaded all their belongings on their two camels. They left quietly without even saying goodbye to the old woman. Akai was crying because she was sad to leave her mother-in-law all alone.
Immediately after Lodipo and his wives had left,  raiders attacked the place.
The raiders asked the old woman to tell them where her son went. "We are going after him to kill him," they told her. She pleaded, "Don't kill the first wife and her children." She also asked them to get back her ram, which Lodipo took with him.
The warriors followed Lodipo. Just as he was settling down in the new place, they caught up with him. They captured him and his young wife.
The first wife, Akai, went back to her mother-in-law with the ram. The two lived together happily.
My village had many problems. We made a long line to fetch water from one tap.
We waited for food donated by others.
We locked our houses early because of thieves.
Many children dropped out of school.
Young girls worked as maids in other villages.
Young boys roamed around the village while others worked on people's farms.
When the wind blew, waste paper hung on trees and fences.
People were cut by broken glass that was thrown carelessly.
Then one day, the tap dried up and our containers were empty.
My father walked from house to house asking people to attend a village meeting.
People gathered under a big tree and listened.
My father stood up and said, “We need to work together to solve our problems.”
Eight-year-old Juma, sitting on a tree trunk shouted, “I can help with cleaning up.”
One woman said, “The women can join me to grow food.”
Another man stood up and said, “The men will dig a well.”
We all shouted with one voice, “We must change our lives.” From that day we worked together to solve our problems.
My heart feels a lot of things.
I feel happy when my granny tells us stories in the evening.
I feel silly when I play with my friend.
I feel bad when my dad says he does not have money.
I feel loved when my mom gives me a hug.

The rat king was very proud. "The rats are the most wonderful animals in the world," he said. All the other rats agreed with him. "You're right," they all said. "We are the most wonderful animals in the world."
"I'm the most wonderful king in the world," said the rat king. "It's true! You are the most wonderful king in the world," shouted all the other rats.
"My son is the most wonderful prince in the world," said the rat king. "We agree! Your son is the most wonderful prince in the world," agreed all the other rats.
"We must find a wife for my son," the rat king said to his elders. "No other animal is as wonderful as the rat. My son must marry the best girl in the world. Where can we find her?"
The elders thought for a long time. Then one of them said,  "There is one person who is greater than us." "Who is that?" asked the rat king. "Our Creator," the elder said. "You're right," the rat king said. "Our Creator is greater than us. Go and ask our Creator for his daughter."
The elders of the rats went up to the sky to see their Creator. "Please," they said. "Our prince,  the son of the rat king,  is the most wonderful animal in the world. Will you give us your daughter to be his wife?"
The Creator smiled. "If your prince is really the most wonderful animal in the world,  then he's too good for my daughter. He must marry someone greater than her," said the Creator. "Who?" asked the rats. "Fog is greater than me," said the Creator. "Fog comes into the sky and covers me. I can't escape from him. I can't send him away. Ask the fog for his daughter."
The elders went back to their king. "The Creator is always right," the rat king said. "The fog is greater. Go and ask the fog for his daughter."
So the elders went to find Fog. They said,  "Our prince is the greatest animal in the world,  and he wants to marry your daughter." "Tell me about him," said Fog. "He's clever and handsome," the elder began. "Stop!" said the fog. "He's too good for my daughter. He must marry someone greater than me."
"Who is greater than the fog?" the elders asked. "Wind is greater than me," said the fog. "She blows me away. I can't stand against the wind. Ask Wind for her daughter."
The elders went back to the rat king. "Fog is right," said the rat king. "Wind is greater than him. Go and ask Wind for her daughter."
The elders went to find the wind. "Great Wind," they said. "We come from the rat king. He is the greatest king in the world and he wants your daughter to marry his son." "Is he really the greatest king in the world?" asked Wind. "He's too good for me. Your prince must find someone greater," she said.
"Who is greater than the wind?" the elders asked. "Mountain is greater than me," answered Wind. "I push against him and blow on him,  but he never moves. Go and ask Mountain for his daughter." The elders went back to their king. "Yes!" he cried. "Wind is right. Go and speak to the mountain."
So the elders went and spoke to the mountain. "Is your prince really so great and wonderful?" asked Mountain. "He is too good for my daughter. He must marry someone better than her." "Who? Who?" asked the elders. "The bush rat is greater than me," the mountain said. "He makes holes inside me and I can't stop him."
The elders went back to their king. The rat king said,  "The bush rat is my cousin! His daughter will be a very good wife for my son."
So the rat prince married the bush rat's daughter. They lived happily for many years.

Once upon a time, there was a boy called Petros. He was a very clever student. He came first in his class and his parents were proud of him. But Petros wished he had a brother, a sister, or a pet to play with.
One day he asked his mom, "Can I play outside? I have studied all morning and I want to play with my friends now." His mom replied, "All right! Go, but don't be late!"
On the way to the playground, Petros saw something unusual. It was a little dog with white and brown spots. The dog was stuck in a hole and he was scared. "Don't worry, I won't hurt you. I will help you," said Petros.
Petros helped the dog out of the hole. He barked with joy, dancing around the boy and licking him. "You are going to be my dog," said Petros happily as they continued to the playground.
The dog ran far ahead. When Petros' friends saw the dog running towards them, they said, "This dog might be dangerous. It might bite us." They picked up stones and threw them at the little dog. Petros was running and shouting for his friends to stop.
The friends did not hear Petros. The small dog ran as fast as he could to save his life. Then he hid from the boys who were chasing him. They did not find him.
Petros' friends went back to the playground and found Petros crying. "What is wrong?" asked one of them. "You chased my dog!" cried Petros. They were shocked and said, "We didn't know it was your dog. We're sorry. Let's find him."
"It's no use. We will never find my dog," said Petros in a hopeless voice. "Yes, we will find him. Get up Petros, we will find your dog. We must not lose hope," his friends said, consoling him.
Petros and his friends searched for the dog all afternoon until they got tired. Finally, Petros said, "There is one last place where the dog could be. If we don't find him there, I will search no more. Let's go to the river."
When the dog saw the boys coming, he was scared. He tried to cross the river but he was scared of the water. He was about to jump into the river, when he heard Petros calling, "Stop, don't jump!"
The dog turned around, saw Petros and ran to him. Petros hugged the dog and the dog licked Petros's face. "My friend! I thought you were gone forever!" cried Petros.
Back at the playground, Petros gave his friends some advice. "Before you make decisions, think about what could happen as a result. Be careful of hurting others." His friends thought about his words and said, "We are sorry. The dog will be our friend too."

Many years ago, hyenas were starving. Because of a famine, even goats, sheep and cows migrated to other places. Hyenas had nothing to eat. They gathered in one place to discuss the issue.
One of the hyenas said, "In our culture, we eat anything that is fleeing. Look, these clouds are fleeing." This hyena believed that the clouds were migrating to another place. He said, "Let's eat them."
Immediately, all the hyenas looked up and saw the clouds moving in the sky. One of the youngest hyenas asked, "How do we reach the clouds? They are very far away from the ground."
The oldest hyena said, "Let the strongest hyena stand on the ground and then let the rest of us stand on each other's backs. We will climb on one another's backs until we reach the clouds."
They agreed and started climbing up on one another's backs. Soon, there were no more hyenas left remaining on the ground except the strongest one.
After the last hyena climbed up, the hyena on the ground thought that the others had started eating. He asked, "Why don't you give me some of the food you're eating?"
However, the hyenas did not reach the clouds. They didn't find any food and so they had nothing to give to the strongest hyena standing on the ground.
The strongest hyena became impatient and moved to the left side. All the others came falling down to the right side. As a result, even today all hyenas limp on their right side.

Once upon a time, there was a hardworking farmer. He had a hardworking wife, and two sons
He had enough food because he and his wife worked very hard. He wanted his children to have a good life. He never let them do any work.
After some time, his wife died.
The man still did not want his children to work. He did the field labour and all the housework too.
But as time went on, the man became old and sick. He started to worry about what would become of his children when he died. They would not be able to take care of themselves.
He called his sons. He said, "My inheritance to you is a lot of gold hidden in the fields. So, it's up to you to plough them and find the gold."
He also called his neighbours and said, "I'm going to die soon. My sons do not know how to look after themselves. Please look after them until they can do it for themselves."
After the man died, the neighbours provided his sons with food for some time.
The brothers did not want to be robbed of the gold their father buried. They decided to do the digging themselves.
They dug one field after another, but they did not find any gold.
They sat down and one asked the other, "Do you think our father cheated us?" The other brother said, "No, I think our father was saying that farming is gold. And if we dig the fields, plant, and plough we can become rich."
So, like all the other farmers, they dug up the fields. They grew wheat and became very rich
Once long ago,  the birds had a meeting. They wanted a king.
The Eagle wanted to be king. The other birds said,  "Your call is too sad to be king." The Ostrich wanted to be king. The other birds said,  "You can't fly."
Peacock wanted to be king. The other birds said,  "You are too proud. You cannot be king." Owl wanted to be king. The other birds said,  "You sleep during the day. You cannot be king."
And so they did not get too far. Then one bird said,  "Who can fly the highest? That bird should be king." All the birds flew up up up into the sky.
Goose flew over the highest mountains in the world. Eagle flew into the blue above the mountains. But Vulture flew without stopping,  up towards the sun.
High above them,  the birds heard Vulture cry,  "I am the highest,  I am king!"
Vulture heard a tiny voice,  "Tink,  tink,  tink! I am the highest,  I am king." It was Ncede,  the Neddicky,  the smallest bird of all! He had held onto the feathers of Vulture as he flew up into the sky!
So Vulture flew down with the little bird still under his wing. The other birds were cross with Ncede. They waited for him,  ready to pluck out all his feathers.
But the quick little bird saw how angry they were,  and flew into an empty snake hole.
The birds told Owl to wait near the hole and catch him when he comes out. So Owl sat in front of the hole.
But the sun was warm and soon Owl was fast asleep. The little bird peeped out,  saw that Owl was asleep,  and z-zip,  away he went.
Owl was very ashamed that he had let the little bird escape. Now he only hunts at night. In the day,  he sleeps,  away from the sight of the other birds.
In the morning, I wake up and get ready for school.
I brush my teeth...
...and take a shower.
I eat my breakfast, which mum makes for me.
I walk to school with my friends and my mum.
All morning, I learn  to read...
...and write.
At noon, I eat my lunch.
In the afternoon, I play ball with my friends.
Then I walk back home from school.
Before it gets dark,  I help my mum cook dinner.
After I eat my dinner...
...I brush my teeth.
At bedtime, I love to listen to a story.
At night, I say goodnight and go to sleep.
I dream of adventures in Lala Land.

Mother and father left their baby with their older children.
The older children played and forgot about the baby.
One day, cranes came across the crying baby.
They lifted the baby in its blanket and flew away.
The mother saw four cranes flying away with her baby.
The cranes looked after the baby.
While the cranes were away, a frog swallowed the baby!
For three flies, the frog returned the baby to its parents.
My village had many problems. We made a long line to fetch water from one tap.
We waited for food donated by others.
We locked our houses early because of thieves.
Many children dropped out of school.
Young girls worked as maids in other villages.
Young boys roamed around the village while others worked on people's farms.
When the wind blew,  waste paper hung on trees and fences.
People were cut by broken glass that was thrown carelessly.
Then one day,  the tap dried up and our containers were empty.
My father walked from house to house asking people to attend a village meeting.
People gathered under a big tree and listened.
My father stood up and said,  "We need to work together to solve our problems."
Eight-year-old Aminu,  sitting on a tree trunk shouted,  "I can help with cleaning up."
One woman said,  "The women can join me to grow food."
Another man stood up and said,  "The men will dig a well."
We all shouted with one voice,  "We must change our lives." From that day we worked together to solve our problems.
Chalew is a horse that pulls a cart.He carries heavy loads along the gravel roads of Debre Birhan. He works from morning to evening.
Chalew does not get enough time to rest.He does not get enough food to eat.The driver of the cart beats him to go faster.
One day, all the cart drivers gathered for a funeral.The cart horses were left to graze in a nearby field.They began to talk about their terrible conditions.
"My harness doesn't fit me. It is too tight and cuts my skin," said one horse. "Me too, me too," another agreed.
An old horse spoke, "I'm almost lame because of the nails they hammer into my hooves." More horses nodded in agreement.
"We work very hard, but most of our owners treat us badly. Many do not know how to look after us," said Chalew. All of the horses agreed.
"We need better conditions. Let's go on strike!" declared Chalew. The horses cheered! They decided to stay in the field until the cart drivers agreed to change.
The cart drivers did not know what to do."I can get another horse," boasted one driver.But most of the drivers needed their horses to earn a living.
The drivers held a meeting to discuss the strike. They argued for a long time. "Maybe the horses are right," said one man. "Why should they get better conditions?" asked another.
The horses' strike spread from the town of Debre Birhan across Ethiopia.Nearly three million horses refused to work."We have had enough! Treat us fairly!" they said.
So, the cart drivers were forced to change.They agreed to better conditions and fair treatment for all horses.They learned how to look after the horses, and keep them healthy.
Slowly, the horses' lives improved. They got enough food and rest. Their harnesses fitted. They got better shoes for their hooves.Old Chalew became a hero to all horses!

Elephant and Hare were good friends.
They found grass and water for their animals.
They liked to play football.
Elephant scored more goals. Hare was not happy.
Hare asked Elephant, "What makes you a good player?" "My big legs."
Hare and Elephant ran a race. Hare won.
Elephant asked Hare, "What makes you a good runner?" "My thin legs."
Elephant asked, "How can I get thin legs?" "I will show you how."
Hare said, "Stand in the fire." Elephant did. He cried, "I am burning!"
Hare told Elephant, "This is the only way your legs can become thin."
Elephant moved out of the fire. He lay down.
For many days, Elephant was not able to stand.
When he was better, he walked home to his family.
Hare was very sorry. He asked Elephant to forgive him.
Adun was very beautiful. All the men in her village wanted to marry her. But Adun refused them all.
One market day,  a man borrowed legs from another man,  and arms from another,  and a body from a third man. Then this man joined all the parts together. He put his head on top and went to the market.
This man wanted Adun and was determined to marry her. Adun was pleased by his appearance. She wanted to be with him. The man came from a far town,  and Adun decided to return with him.
As Adun and the man journeyed to his place,  the owner of the legs took the legs back. Then the owner of the arms took his arms back. And finally the owner of the body took that back.
Only the head was left,  and the head went on. Adun was scared but she did not run away. They arrived at the house of the head.
The following morning,  before the head went to his farm,  he spoke to Tortoise. "If Adun tries to escape,  blow this horn to tell me," said the head.
After the head left,  Adun packed her things. Then she began to run away.
Seeing her,  Tortoise blew the horn,  "Head,  head,  Adun is about to run away," puffed Tortoise.
The head went up to Adun and said,  "Where do you think you are going?" Adun went back to the head's house.
Eventually Adun consulted a diviner about what to do. The diviner advised,  "Go and buy some bean cakes. Soak them in palm oil and put them in Tortoise's horn."
Adun followed the diviner's instructions. She put the oily cakes into the horn.
The following day,  she took her things and began to run away again. When Tortoise took the horn to blow it,  the delicious bean cakes fell into his mouth.
Tortoise ate,  ate and ate. And Adun ran away.
“I can’t lift you up, Shanu!” says Ammi. “You are too big!”
“You can’t walk to school alone, Shanu!” says Abbu. “You are too small!”
“You can’t sleep in the baby’s cot, Shanu!” says Dadu. “You are too big!”
“You can’t carry the baby to the park, Shanu!” says Dadi. “You are too small!”
Shanu is puzzled. Too big! Too small! How can she be too big andtoo small all at once?
Too big to wear her old pink frock.Too small to make dosas at the stove.
Too big to climb up on Dadu’s back?Too smallto carry the baby on hers?
“What am I the right size for?” Shanu wonders.
Ammi smiles and says, “Why, you are just big enough to go to big school.”
“And you are just small enough for me to carry you on my shoulders,” says Abbu.
“You are just big enough to take me for my morning walks,” says Dadu.
“And you are just small enough for me to tell stories to,” says Dadi.
“And you will always, always be the perfect size...for this!" all say, and give her a warm, wonderful hug.
It is break time at Siyafunda Primary School. Nomsa,  Jabu and Zodwa have just sat down in the shade to enjoy their lunch. Today Nomsa and Zodwa brought food from home,  but Jabu is eating a kota from Mr Mkhize's shop.
"Mmmm,  this cheese is creamy! Mr Mkhize's kotas are the best!" exclaims Jabu licking his fingers. Tebogo is sitting nearby and overhears Jabu. He can't believe his ears! Tebogo asks,  "Did you just say there's cheese on Mkhize's kota? Did you say Mkhize's kotas are the best? Are you joking?"
"Haa! You don't know Mr Mkhize! He's changed his ways and this kota speaks for itself," says Jabu pointing at his kota. The kota is stuffed with chips,  polony and atchar,  and covered in creamy melting cheese. Tebogo is impressed,  "It's true,  and the bread is really packed with filling!" Just then Scelo arrives with his lunch and Tebogo says to his friend,  "Hey Scelo,  look at this kota!"
Jabu notices Scelo's face and asks,  "Why you are looking so serious!"  Scelo puts his kota on the bench next to Jabu's kota. "I got my kota from Mr Motaung. The kotas are equal in size,  but mine has less filling!" "Yes," says Nomsa,  "that's exactly why so many kids are buying from Mr Mkhize's shop now."
"So Mr Mkhize is a changed man? He used to slice one loaf of bread into five parts to make his kotas!" says Tebogo. "Ah!" replies Nomsa,  "that was not a kota at all!" "Why was it not a kota?" asks Scelo.
"Ha Scelo!" laughs Nomsa. "Don't you remember what our teacher taught us about fractions? Cutting one loaf of bread into five equal pieces does not give us quarters. It gives us fifths."  Scelo thinks,  then he says,  "I remember! Each part of a whole divided into 5 equal parts is ⅕ of the whole. Each part of a whole divided into 4 equal pieces is ¼ of the whole."
Zodwa interrupts,  "But hey guys,  what is going on with Mr Motaung's kota's? They're a quarter of a loaf,  but they contain less than Mr Mkhize's kotas." Jabu frowns and says to the group,  "If Motaung is having problems and goes out of business,  then Mkhize will have no competition. What if Mkhize gets greedy and goes back to his bad old ways?"
A few days later,  Mr Motaung is getting ready to sell lunch at break time. He's worried. Lately,  fewer and fewer learners are buying from him. Mr Motaung asks himself,  "Why are they all flocking to Mkhize? What is it that he's doing that I'm not? I thought we were selling the same kota at the same price."
Jabu on his way from Mr Mkhize's shop passes by Mr Motaung's shop. He calls the boy over,  "Hey Jabu,  how are you? I've not seen you for some time."  Mr Motaung's eyes are not on Jabu but the kota Jabu is carrying! He realises that the kota has got more chips,  more cheese,  more polony and more atchar! Mr Motaung smiles because he has figured out Mkhize's secret.
The next time Nomsa and Zodwa are buying kotas,  Mkhize gives them a gift. "Wait a minute,  I've got a surprise for you. Soon I'll be selling fruit at my shop. Here are some sweet juicy apples to try for free. Please share with your friends."
The girls are delighted. "Thank you Mr Mkhize!" they say at the same time. They decide to share the apples with Jabu,  Tebogo and Scelo,  and go to find them in the yard.
Zodwa tells the boys,  "Mr Mkhize gave us these apples to share. He wants to sell them at his shop." Nomsa puts the apples on the bench so that they can all count them. "Well," says Tebogo,  "we can each have an equal number of apples. But there's one apple left over."
"Let's cut that remaining apple into three equal parts," suggests Jabu. "What are those equal parts called?" mutters Nomsa to herself. "Thirds! Cut the apple into thirds! Three equal parts," says Scelo proudly.
"No,  let's give that leftover apple to our maths teacher!" says Zodwa. The friends agree that it's a good suggestion to give the apple to Ms Nkosi after break.
The next week,  Jabu and Nomsa are waiting for Zodwa at break. Zodwa arrives with her kota. "Look,  Motaung is back in business!" she says. Zodwa puts her kota on the bench and the three of them compare the kotas. "Wow!" says Jabu,  "that kota is bigger than a quarter! And look at all those chips!" "I bet this cost a lot extra? How does Mr Motaung make a profit?" asks Nomsa suspiciously.
After break,  as they head back to class,  Zodwa takes her friends to read the notice board outside Mr Motaung's shop. Jabu and Nomsa can't believe their eyes when they read the following on the notice: Get your supersize kota! Only R3 more! A third of a loaf with extra chips and extra sauce. With polony OR cheese!
There was a young beautiful mule called Wardit.
A handsome horse said, “I must marry Wardit.”
The horse said, “Let us go together to the river.”
The horse asked Wardit to be his wife. Wardit agreed.
The horse asked Wardit, “Who are your father and mother?”
Wardit said, “My mother lives in the king’s palace.”
“My sister lives in the Church compound. Don’t you know her?”
She added, “My beautiful aunt lives with the village headman.”
Then an old donkey walked by. It was Wardit’s father.
Wardit did not greet her father or look at him.
The old donkey asked, “What is the matter, my girl?"
The horse asked Wardit, “Who is this stupid donkey?”
Wardit said, “I don’t know him.”
The horse kicked the old donkey.
The old donkey was heart-broken. He cried and died.
Because Wardit did not respect her father, she cannot have children.

Anil became very angry. He was angry on his mother too.
" Let's go to the market and let's buy you something," said the mother.
Even after going to the market Anil was very angry. "I want that" he kept showing his finger while looking at the orange."No, no! Not that! All the fruits will fall down!" Said the fruit vendor.
"I want that book" said Anil."No, no! Not that! Take this." Said the shopkeeper.
"I want that!" Anil said it in the interest of taking one samosa. "No, no! Not that! All my samosa's will fall down!" Said the sweet vendor.
"I want that!" said Anil. "No, no! Not that! Don't even touch it! The flowers will dry up." Said the flower vendor.

Long ago, the cats and the mice were friends.
Then, the mice started losing some of their relatives.
An old mouse said, "The cats are eating us."
Mothers told children, "Be careful. Do not go outside."
All the mice were careful. They stayed inside their holes.
The hungry cats asked, "Where are all the mice?"
The cats decided to visit the mice. They wanted to arrange a wedding.
The cats said, "Let one of your daughters marry our son."
The mice told the cats, "You want to eat us."
Later, they agreed. They planned a wedding between their children.
The cats went home happily licking their lips.
On the wedding day, the mice were careful.
The cats arrived singing a wedding song.
They sang:"Catch them and eat them! Catch them and eat them!"
The old mouse began to sing:"Run, mice, run!Run, mice, run!"
The old mouse said to the cats, "We are not friends."
There was a rich man who looked for a wife for a long time. When he married, he had a big ceremony that was blessed by the elders.
After years of marriage, the man and woman began to worry because they did not have a child. The woman prayed for a child again and again. But she still did not become pregnant.
One day, tired of waiting, she said, “Devil, if you give me a child, I will make a beautiful scarf for you.” The following month, she became pregnant. She was happy and made the scarf which she had promised.
The woman gave birth to a baby boy. Everybody rejoiced with her. She wanted to give the scarf to the devil but realised that she did not know how to find him. So she visited an elder and asked him for advice.
The elder said, “To find the devil, go near the church. You will find two men standing before a wise man. These two have been fighting. The one who refuses to reconcile and leaves in anger is the devil! Follow him and give him this scarf.”
The woman went near the church. She saw two men standing before a wise man. The wise man said, “Enough! It's time to forgive each other from the heart.” One of the men bent forward to ask for forgiveness. The other one refused and walked away.
The woman called after him, “Wait! I have something for you.” She offered him the scarf. The angry man asked, “What is this?” The woman answered, “It is your present.” He replied, “I do not understand why you are giving me this present.”
The woman told him the story. She said, “You are the man who refused to apologise. That means you are the devil.” She stretched out her hand to give him the scarf.
This man ran back to the church. He knelt down in front of the other man and said to him, “I forgive you. Forgive me too.” The other man also knelt. They hugged each other.
The woman continues to search for the devil. Make sure the scarf does not belong to you!
Mod the toad was tired of living in water.
"Be careful," said the turtle. "Your skin will dry out."
But Mod was curious. She hopped away.
She looked all around.
She met a purple chameleon next to a puddle of water.
The chameleon started turning pink! Mod jumped away.
Then she saw a hyena starting a fire.

Once up on a time, there were two friends. The one was clever, the other was stupid. The stupid man's wife was clever. The clever man's wife was stupid.
While they were chatting, the clever man said, "Your wife is clever, but you are stupid. My wife is also stupid, so she might be more compatible with you."
The stupid man asked, "Between me and you, who is stupider?" Then he said, "I am as clever as you are." "If so, let's go to a judge and I will ask you a question," replied the clever man. They agreed to go.
In front of the judge, the clever man asked, "How many stars are there in the sky? Where is the centre of the world? Answer both questions, or we will swap our wives." The judge allowed some time for the stupid man to return with the answers.
One night, the stupid man was counting the stars, sitting on the roof of his house. "What are you doing?" his wife asked him.
He replied, "My friend asked me how many stars there are in the sky, and where the centre of the earth is. Now I'm counting the stars."
"Don't worry, I will tell you the answers," said his wife. She gave her husband a sack of grain. She said, "If they ask you how many stars are in the sky, tell them it is the same as the number of grains in the sack."
Then she gave him a stick and said, "If they ask you where the centre of the world is, push the stick into the ground and tell them it is in the centre. If they complain, tell them to measure it."
The stupid man arrived with his wife's advice. First he answered, "The number of stars is the same as the number of grains in this sack." Then he pushed the stick into the ground and said, "This is the centre of the earth."
The judge was amused and asked, "Who told you this?" The stupid man replied, "My wife."    The judge continued, "Your wife is very clever, so she should be with a clever man. You will swap your wives."  Then, the judge set an appointment to swap their wives.
The stupid man told his wife, "I won, but the judge said that you are clever, and don't deserve to be with me." His wife replied, "Don't worry I have a solution to this too."
The time came for the judge to swap the wives. The clever wife gave the judge a saucepan of food as a gift. When the judge opened the saucepan, he saw a roasted chicken still with all its feathers! Shocked, he muttered, "Oh, I see, so she belongs with her stupid husband afterall!"
Once upon a time,  Leopard and Squirrel were friends. They shared a herd of goats. They took turns to take the goats out for grazing.
Leopard was not good at goat herding. When he took the goats out,  they always came back hungry.
Squirrel always went out with her mother. Squirrel's mother climbed into the trees and pulled off the leaves. She threw the leaves down to the goats and they ate happily.
One day,  Leopard said to Squirrel,  "When you take the goats out,  they come home happy. But when I take them out,  they come home hungry. Why is that?"  Squirrel pointed at the branding iron next to the fire.
She said,  "I tie the branding iron to the goats' tails. They get frightened,  so they run around and find food. But when you take them,  they are lazy and stand in one place. That's why they don't find any food."
Leopard was angry. "This stupid Squirrel is not telling me the truth," he thought. "She's laughing at me. I'll follow her tomorrow and watch."
So,  the next day,  Leopard followed Squirrel. He was careful to make sure that she didn't see him. He watched her from far away.
Squirrel stopped under a tree and called,  "Mother! Come and help me! I have to find food for the goats!" At once,  Squirrel's mother began to help her daughter. She pulled leaves off the branches.
"Look at that!" thought Leopard. "Squirrel's mother helps her. They don't use any branding irons at all."  He felt angry. "Squirrel thinks I'm stupid," he thought. "She was trying to trick me. But I'll show her!"
The next day,  it was Leopard's turn to take out the goats. He took them past the tree and called,  "Mother! Come and help me! I have to find food for the goats." Squirrel's mother ran down from the tree. Leopard jumped on her and killed her.
The next day,  it was Squirrel's turn again. She drove the goats past the tree and called,  "Mother! Come and help me! I have to find food for the goats." But no one answered. No one came. "Mother!" Squirrel called again. "Where are you?"
Squirrel suspected the truth and began to cry. "Oh,  Mother," she cried. "You're dead. Was it Leopard who killed you?" Squirrel wept all day and her eyes became red.
In the evening,  Squirrel drove the goats home again. "What's the matter,  Squirrel?" asked Leopard. "Why are your eyes red?" "I met the healer today," answered Squirrel. "He gave me some medicine to put in my eyes. With this medicine I will become big and strong."
Leopard said,  "I would like some of that medicine. Can you give me some?" Yes," replied Squirrel. "But you won't like it because it will hurt your eyes," said Squirrel. "Give me the medicine now," said Leopard. He lay down and opened his eyes."
Squirrel took some stones and put them on the fire. They became red hot.
She put them on Leopard's eyes. "Take the stones away!" screamed Leopard. "Give me back my eyes!" Leopard was blinded by the stones. "I'll give you back your eyes when you bring back my mother," hissed Squirrel.

One day the rabbit found a snail. He said to the snail,  "You can't run! All you know is how to crawl on the ground."
The snail said,  "Come and see on Sunday."
The snail prepared a hundred pieces of paper and wrote the same message on them.
The snail handed out the pieces of paper to his friends and said,  "When the rabbit comes here calling me,  one of you must say: I am the snail."
Then the snail told his friends to hide behind the bushes where the rabbit and the snail were to pass.
On Sunday,  the rabbit arrived and found the snail. The rabbit said,  "Let´s have a race. But I will win."
Snails lined up behind trees on the racing track so that each time the rabbit passed,  a snail would shout,  'I am the snail' During the race,  the rabbit called out,  "Snail! Snail!"
One of the snails hidden behind the bushes answered,  "I am the snail! I am the snail!"
Finally,  the rabbit was very tired. He lay down,  saying,  "Snail,  I am so tired; you have won." One snail watched from behind the bush.
So the snail won the race because he was clever!

Long,  long time ago,  animals used to speak.  There lived Hare and Hyena.
The two were very closed friends.  They did everything together including looking for food.
Hare was very clever. She gathered more food than the lazy Hyena.
Hyena was lazy but he liked eating very much. Although they hunted differently,  they put the food together.
Hare used her tricks to get food faster.   She also ate some before taking it to where Hyena was.
During the drought,  it was very hard for the two to gather enough food for themselves.
One day,  Hare woke Hyena up very early in the morning. They stood under a tree to discuss how they were going to live.

It is break time at Siyafunda Primary School. Nomsa, Jabu and Zodwa have just sat down in the shade to enjoy their lunch. Today Nomsa and Zodwa brought food from home, but Jabu is eating a kota from Mr Mkhize's shop.
“Mmmm, this cheese is creamy! Mr Mkhize's kotas are the best!” exclaims Jabu licking his fingers. Tebogo is sitting nearby and overhears Jabu. He can't believe his ears! Tebogo asks, “Did you just say there's cheese on Mkhize's kota? Did you say Mkhize's kotas are the best? Are you joking?”
“Haa! You don't know Mr Mkhize! He's changed his ways and this kota speaks for itself,” says Jabu pointing at his kota. The kota is stuffed with chips, polony and atchar, and covered in creamy melting cheese. Tebogo is impressed. Just then Scelo arrives with his lunch and Tebogo says to his friend, “Hey Scelo, look at this kota!”
Jabu notices Scelo's face and asks, “Why you are so serious!” Scelo puts his kota on the bench next to Jabu's kota. “I got my kota from Mr Motaung. The kotas are equal in size, but mine has less filling!” “Yes,” says Nomsa, “that's exactly why so many kids are buying from Mr Mkhize's shop now.”
“So Mr Mkhize is a changed man? He used to slice one loaf of bread into five parts to make his kotas!” says Tebogo. “Ah!” replies Nomsa, “that was not a kota at all!” “Why was it not a kota?” asks Scelo.
“Ha Scelo!” laughs Nomsa. “Don't you remember what our teacher taught us about fractions? Cutting one loaf of bread into five equal pieces does not give us quarters. It gives us fifths.” Scelo thinks, then he says, “I remember! Each part of a whole divided into 5 equal parts is. of the whole. Each part of a whole divided into 4 equal pieces is ¼ of the whole.”
Zodwa interrupts, “But hey guys, what is going on with Mr Motaung's kota's? They're a quarter of a loaf, but they contain less than Mr Mkhize's kotas.” Jabu frowns and says to the group, “If Motaung is having problems and goes out of business, then Mkhize will have no competition. What if Mkhize gets greedy and goes back to his bad old ways?”
A few days later, Mr Motaung is getting ready to sell lunch at break time. He's worried. Lately, fewer and fewer learners are buying from him. Mr Motaung asks himself, “Why are they all flocking to Mkhize? I thought we were selling the same kota at the same price.”
Jabu on his way from Mr Mkhize's shop passes by Mr Motaung's shop. He calls the boy over, “Hey Jabu, how are you?” Mr Motaung's eyes are not on Jabu but on the kota Jabu is carrying! He smiles when he realises that the kota has got more chips, more cheese, more polony and more atchar than his kotas!
The next time Nomsa and Zodwa are buying kotas, Mkhize gives them a gift. “Wait a minute, I've got a surprise for you. Soon I'll be selling fruit at my shop. Here are some sweet juicy apples to try for free. Please share with your friends.”
The girls are delighted. “Thank you Mr Mkhize!” they say at the same time. They decide to share the apples with Jabu, Tebogo and Scelo, and go to find them in the yard.
Zodwa tells the boys, “Mr Mkhize gave us these apples to share. He wants to sell them at his shop.”Nomsa puts the apples on the bench so that they can all count them. “Well,” says Tebogo, “we can each have an equal number of apples. But there's one apple left over.”
“Let's cut that remaining apple into three equal parts,” suggests Jabu. “What are three equal parts called?” mutters Nomsa to herself. “Thirds! Cut the apple into thirds!” says Scelo proudly.
“No, let's give that leftover apple to our maths teacher!” says Zodwa. The friends agree that it's a good suggestion to give the apple to Ms Nkosi after break.
The next week, Jabu and Nomsa are waiting for Zodwa at break. “Look, Motaung is back in business!” she says. Zodwa puts her kota on the bench and the three of them compare their kotas. “Wow!” says Jabu, “that kota is bigger than a quarter! And look at all those chips!”“I bet this cost a lot extra?” asks Nomsa suspiciously.
After break, as they head back to class, Zodwa takes her friends to read the notice board outside Mr Motaung's shop. Jabu and Nomsa can't believe their eyes when they read the sign: Get your supersize kota third! Only R3 more! A third of a loaf with extra chips and extra sauce. With polony OR cheese!
Fire,  Water,  Truth and Lies were friends.
But Lies was not happy and wanted to destroy their friendship.
One day Lies said,  "Why don't we all go and look for free land. Then each one of us can have a kingdom?" They agreed and started walking.
Lies went to Water and said,  "Fire is our worst enemy. She burns everything. We need to find a kingdom without her around."
Water said,  "What should we do?" Lies replied,  "Obviously we'll have to kill her. You are the only one with the power to do that. When she is sitting down,  splash on her and destroy her!"
Water said,  "If I do that I'll spill on the earth and won't be able to become one again." But Lies said,  "No problem,  I'll put some stones down,  so you won't spill away. I will collect you again." Lies put down stones to collect Water.
When the unsuspecting Fire sat down,  Water poured all over her. This way,  Lies got rid of Fire and they went on their way.
After some time,  Lies said to Water,  "Look,  why don't you sit at the top of this cliff to enjoy the scenery?"
When Water sat down,  Lies sneaked up and pulled the stones from under her. She spilled away,  and that was the end of her.
Now,  Lies had to get rid of Truth. When they came to a big mountain,  Lies told Truth to wait at the bottom of the mountain.
He pushed down a big stone to crush Truth.
When the stone crashed down,  diamonds and gold and all sorts of valuable things fell out. Truth managed to crawl out from the broken stone.
Lies came down to look at the body of Truth. Instead,  he saw all the valuable things. He asked,  "Where did these come from?"
Truth said,  "When the stone landed on me,  this is what came out." Lies wanted these valuable things too. He said,  "I'll go down to the bottom of the mountain. You go up and push down another big stone."
So,  Truth went up and pushed down a big stone.
The stone landed on Lies' head and crushed him to death.
In a village there was a disagreement among people of different occupations. Everyone thought their work was the most important!
The teacher said that he had the most important occupation. “Without teachers you could not go to school and learn.”
The builder said that he had the most important occupation. “Without builders you would not have schools to learn in or houses to sleep in.”
The carpenter said that he had the most important occupation. “Without carpenters you would have no furniture for your houses and schools.”
The doctor claimed that he had the most important occupation. “Without doctors and nurses you could get sick and die.”
The farmer said that she had the most important occupation. “Without farmers you would not have food to eat.”
The student argued that students had the most important work. “Without students, there would be no teachers, builders, doctors, farmers, or carpenters.”
Eventually everyone agreed that all the occupations are important. We need teachers, builders, doctors, farmers, and carpenters. But everyone has to be a student first!
Tarik was a Grade 4 student at Elementary School. His school was in Menz district in the province of North Shoa, Ethiopia.
Tarik had a dog called Buchie. Where Buchie was, Tarik was there too. When Tarik's mom gave Tarik food, he shared it with Buchie.
Tarik and Bedilu were in the same class. They were shepherds when they were not at school. One Saturday morning, Tarik and Bedilu were taking their flock to the common grazing land.
They also carried their school books to study for examinations. Bedilu said, “Let's play kisara for few minutes to relax our minds.” Tarik replied, “No, we should start studying!”
“We will study soon. Please play!” Bedilu begged. In the end, the boys played kisara. (Kisara is a game where players take turns throwing flat stones or coins into a small hole, standing about a meter away.)
Without noticing, they played the game for about two hours. When they looked, they couldn't see their sheep anywhere. They ran everywhere searching for the sheep.
From a distance, they saw a wolf chasing their sheep! Then they saw that the wolf had killed Tarik's sheep. He began crying. He knew that his father would punish him severely.
When Bedilu took his sheep home, Tarik didn't go home. He decided to spend the night in the big tree not far from his house. He slept on a low branch and Buchie slept below him on the ground.
At midnight, Tarik was woken by a loud scream of hyenas. He got such a fright that he fell off the branch, down to the ground.
Tarik heard sounds of animals near him but it was too dark to see them. He began sweating, thinking that it must be hyenas.
Suddenly, lightning flashed light across the sky. Tarik was able to see around him. There was Buchie standing guard and protecting him from two snarling hyenas.
Buchie saved Tarik, what a friend he was indeed! The boy scrambled back up into the tree, taking Buchie with him. Together they would wait for morning and then go home to face Tarik's father.

Lara the ladybird was a special bug.

Everyone lovedher yellow wings.
Each morning,Bibi Butterfly said hello.And Manto Mantisalways waved.
Even Sesa, thesulky spider, was happy to see her.
At school, sheplayed with lots of friends.
But Lara wanted to be like the other ladybirds. “I wish I had red wings like you,Mama,” shecried.
So one day, tocheer her up, Lara’s mother painted her wings bright red.
The next morning, nobody greeted Lara on her way to school.
And when she gotthere, none of herfriends said hello.
Lara sat allalone. No one noticed her new red wings.
Until Miss Miyaspotted her and said: “You’ve paintedyour lovely yellow wings!”
Lara’s classmateswere shocked. “Your wings are special!”“So unique!”“So rare!”
“Lara,” Miss Miyasaid, “your yellow wings are what make you you.Like Sipho’s spot… and Sally’s legs.”
Back home, Laratook a long bath and scrubbed until her golden wings gleamed.
“I’ll never paintmy wings again!”she thought.Except, maybe once or twice …
To try a bit ofpurple …or something nice.But not for everand just for fun.
If someone is in water, you can use a stick to pull the person to safety. Never get into the water to try and rescue someone. If you get into the water, you could also drown.
If the person who needs help is too far away from you to reach with a stick, you can throw something that floats.Throw something they can hold on to and use to stay above the water. You could throw a soccer ball or an empty five-litre plastic container.
If someone needs rescuing from water, ask a lifeguard or adult for help. Never go into the water to try and rescue someone yourself. You can also call the free national emergency number, 112, from a cell phone or a landline.
If someone is rescued from the water and they are not breathing, you should call 112 for help. You can then start Hands-on CPR by pushing hard and fast in the centre of their chest. Do not practice this on a friend!You can find out more from the National Sea Rescue Institute.

A poor farmer had an old ox that didn't like to work. The ox didn't want to plough the farmer's field. He wanted to stay at home and eat grass, drink water and rest.
The farmer had a donkey, too. The donkey and the ox were friends. At the end of the day, the ox and the donkey talked to each other. “I'm so tired,” the ox said. “I worked hard all day. The plough is big and heavy. The farmer never lets me rest.”
The donkey thought, “The ox is lazy. He doesn't like to work.” He cried, “Do you think your plough is heavy? Believe me, my friend, it is light! I carried a sack of grain on my back today. It was heavier than your plough, I am sure.”
The next day, the two animals met again. “I had a bad day today,” the ox said. “My master's field is far away, and it was full of stones. I worked hard all day. I didn't have any rest.”
“You worked hard?” asked the donkey. “Today I travelled many kilometres to the market in the town. I'm sure I worked harder than you.”
The next day, the ox came home late again. “Oh, my friend,” he said to the donkey. “Today was a very bad day for me.” But the donkey didn't want to listen to the ox any more.
He said, “You're always tired. When the farmer comes, lie down and say, 'Moo! Moo!' He will think that you are ill. He will let you rest.” The ox liked the donkey's idea. “Thank you, dear donkey, that's a very good idea,” he said.
The next morning, the ox lay down and closed his eyes. “Moo! Moo!” he said. The farmer looked at him. “My poor old ox is sick,” he said.“ But I must plough my field. Who will help me? Perhaps the donkey! He can pull the plough today.”
The farmer tied the plough to the donkey, and began to hit him with his whip. “Go on! Faster! Pull!” he called out to the donkey. The donkey worked hard all day, and in the evening he was very tired.
The donkey slowly walked home. The ox said, “Dear donkey, I had a lovely day today. I ate some grass, drank some water and I rested. I want to rest again tomorrow. Give me another idea.”
The donkey thought, “His work is much worse than mine. I don't want to do it again tomorrow.” The donkey said, “Be careful. The farmer said 'My ox is always tired and now he is sick. If he is not better tomorrow, I will kill him, and we can eat the meat.'”
The ox was very frightened. He cried, “Really? Did he say that? Then I will work tomorrow. I feel quite better now. I'm not tired at all!”

Fana and her family live in Debre Birhan, a busy town in Ethiopia. Fana is a Grade 3 student. She is good-hearted and wise.
Fana loves animals. She has a cat, two hens, a goat and a dove. She spends time with these animals, feeding them, and playing with them.
One day, Fana was playing in the school yard with her friends when she saw children throwing stones at doves. “Why are they hurting the doves?” She asked herself.
She stopped playing and ran towards the children throwing stones. At first her friends didn't understand what was happening, then theyfollowed her. “Stop throwing stones,” shouted Fana.
The other children ran away. Fana caught the two injured doves. She saw wounds on their wings. She decided to take the two doves home to look after them.
She fed the doves. In the evening she told her family what she saw and did during the day, and how she saved the doves.
In the morning Fana and her parents went to the clinic and got medicine for the doves. After a few days, the doves' wounds healed. Fana felt very happy.
Fana always tells her friends, “I love animals. Animals are useful to us and they are our friends. We must protect and preserve them.”
Once upon a time, there lived a woman. She always wanted a child.
The girl who was made of mud became a real human girl. The woman named the girl Akatope.
The woman was very happy. She loved Akatope very much.
Akatope was warned by her mother not to go out of the hut. She did not listen. Whenever her mother was not home, Akatope ran out to play with other children.
The other children ran to their huts. As Akatope ran, her legs started to dissolve. She hunched over and sat down between bushes.
The other children told their parents what had happened to Akatope. They were very sad and shocked.
When the woman heard what had happened to Akatope, she cried for many days. The villagers took an orphan girl to take the place of Akatope.
One night, there was a gentle knock on the door.
"Who could that be," the woman wondered.
Akatope had come home. She was tired and sick.
Akatope's mother sold everything she owned. She used the money to treat Akatope. Akatope grew up to be the most beautiful girl in the village.

There were some naughty monkeys on the tree. They came down and took some caps from     the basket.
Raju woke up and saw that the monkeys were wearing a cap. Now, Raju was a clever man. He   thought of a plan. He took of his cap and threw it on the ground.
The monkeys also threw down their caps.
Raju quickly picked up his caps. He packed them in his basket and walked away with a smile.
What do you think could be the moral of the story!
There was a rich man who looked for a wife for a long time. When he married,  he had a big ceremony that was blessed by the elders.
After years of marriage,  the man and woman began to worry because they did not have a child. The woman prayed for a child again and again. But she still did not become pregnant.
One day,  tired of waiting,  she said,  "Devil,  if you give me a child,  I will make a beautiful scarf for you." The following month,  she became pregnant. She was happy and made the scarf which she had promised.
The woman gave birth to a baby boy. Everybody rejoiced with her. She wanted to give the scarf to the devil but realised that she did not know how to find him. So she visited an elder and asked him for advice.
The elder said,  "To find the devil,  go near the church. You will find two men standing before a wise man. These two have been fighting. The one who refuses to reconcile and leaves in anger is the devil! Follow him and give him this scarf."
The woman went near the church. She saw two men standing before a wise man. The wise man said,  "Enough! It's time to forgive each other from the heart." One of the men bent forward to ask for forgiveness. The other one refused and walked away.
The woman called after him,  "Wait! I have something for you." She offered him the scarf. The angry man asked,  "What is this?" The woman answered,  "It is your present." He replied,  "I do not understand why you are giving me this present."
The woman told him the story. She said,  "You are the man who refused to apologise. That means you are the devil." She stretched out her hand to give him the scarf.
This man ran back to the church. He knelt down in front of the other man and said to him,  "I forgive you. Forgive me too." The other man also knelt. They hugged each other.
The woman continues to search for the devil. Make sure the scarf does not belong to you!
Udoo, Erdoo and Eryum gathered around mother. With plenty of love in her heart and her totem in her hand, mother cleared her throat and began the story:There was a little girl called Yana. Yana's aunt told her about a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. Yana was curious about that pot. Did the pot contain gold coins, or lumps of gold in black rocks?
Yana imagined that if she looked at the sky long enough, she would get some answers.She smiled at the birds. She wondered how the gold got into the pot. And, where at the rainbow's end would she find the pot? Yana wished that she knew the exact spot!
As she thought about her rainbow quest, Yana saw a green frog jumping in the bushes. She could not resist, she jumped around with the frog for a while.Then, checking the sky, she said goodbye to the frog. Yana went on her way in search for the end of the rainbow.
She began to think about the rainbow's colours. In a flash, red came first to mind.She recalled the day her family almost had a bad accident because a driver didn't stop at a red light. Yana was thankful because no one was badly hurt, although they all had cuts and bruises. Everyone got a huge fright.
After red, Yana thought of the colour orange. She loved sweet oranges.Sweet, sour and bitter were the tastes she experienced while eating oranges.Thinking about a sour orange made Yana's mouth taste sour! Yuck! Do you know that taste?
Yana's thoughts moved from oranges to a bowl of dark indigo beans, and her stomach made noises. She realized that she was hungry.Her rainbow quest would have to wait for a while. It was time to eat some food!
She ran into her aunt's kitchen. The air carried the aroma of the fried chicken and fresh bread. Yana washed her hands and her nose led her to the food. She ate a little chicken with a large piece of bread, and then she drank water. She looked down at her dress. What a mess! Stains from the chicken, and water spilled. So she changed into a beautiful purple dress.
Later, Yana and her aunt went out to the park together. They lay on the grass with a book. Yana eagerly peered into the pages itching to finally know more about the hidden pot of gold.Yana's aunt chuckled at her excitement and they both burst into peals of laughter. They began to read the story together.
It was a tale about how the rainbow colours came to the land of Tonota, and  a little boy called Mpho. For the longest time, the people of Tonota only knew the green of plants and the brown of soil. But Mpho had dreams of clouds in glorious colours! He told the elders about his dreams. They said, "If you name the colours, we can bring them to life."
The elders asked for the help of rainmakers from across the land, and they gathered together.Mpho began thinking about the colours in his dreams. Then, these words came to his mind, "Red, blue, orange, yellow, purple, green, and indigo."The colourful clouds filled the sky!
The clouds hung in the air, and the rainmakers formed a circle, holding hands. The rainmakers looked up to the clouds and the colours formed a beautiful arc. This was Tonata's first rainbow! People cheered and rejoiced. And just then, Mpho noticed a pot at the end of the rainbow. A pot filled with gold!
"What an amazing rainbow story! Now I know where to find my pot of gold!" exclaimed Yana to her aunt.Her aunt smiled, happy she shared her favourite childhood story with her niece. "But, no more rainbow quests for you! The pot of gold can only be found by accident!"
With those words, mother finished her rainbow tale. Udoo, Erdoo and Eryum jumped up and gave her a standing ovation. Then they held hands like the rainmakers, pretending to make their own rainbow!
"Mother, does every land have its own rainbow story?" asked Erdoo thoughtfully. "Yes, my lovelies," said mother. "Tonota's rainbow started with Mpho's dreams of colourful clouds. And remember the Magical Rainbow River and its rainbow ice-cream?"   "Mmmm, rainbow ice-cream, that's my favourite story," said Eryum looking at mother hopefully as the children gathered around her again.
I wonder ifthere's another me somewhere in the world.
Who looks thesame.
And talks thesame.
And even has mycurls.
Someone with myeyes my ears.
Who even has mylaugh.
Who can do what Ican do.
And can't do whatI can't.
I've looked andlooked everywhere to find another me. I went down to the park and looked behindthe trees.
I looked around,up and down.
At every singleface.
I couldn't find anotherme in any single place.
There's only oneme in the world! I'm special, oh it's true!
But not just me,don't you see? There's only one of you!
'Wov! What a lovely raincoat!' Mannu danced happily holding the shining red raincoat that his parents had bought for him.'Mamma, may I wear the raincoat now?' Manu asked his mother.Mamma said, 'No, my child. You can wear it when it rains. It should start raining soon. But as of now I don't see any signs of the rain.'
But, Monday was a bright sunny day, full of golden sunshine.Mannu looked out of the window every now and then and asked his mother,'Mamma, will it rain today?'Mamma  peeped out of the window and said, ' I don't think it will rain today. You cannot wear the raincoat today. People will laugh at you, if you do.'
On Tuesday also Mannu kept looking at the sky. And the raincoat was kept right next to him, ready to be used. But the sky was a nice blue and as bright as it was on Monday.Mannu was disappointed,'Mamma, when will I be able to use the raincoat?''There is just a single cloud in the sky today, and that too a white one. I don't think you will get a chance to wear the raincoat today.'Mamma said.
Wednesday again was a very hot sunny day.Mannu was getting worried, 'Mamma, why is it not raining yet?'He tried to put the raincoat on at home. But had to immediately take it off because he felt too hot in it.Mamma, in her eagerness to comfort him said, 'I think it will rain soon, probably by afternoon.'
On Thursday, there was the school picnic. Mannu was eager to show off the raincoat to his school buddies.'Mamma, shall I carry the raincoat to the picnic. What if it rains there?' Mannu asked.'Don't, my pet. It will not rain today. See those white clouds? And they are also so far away.' Mamma tried to comfort him.
And... at last  on Friday, the sky looked quite dark with black clouds. Mannu kept the raincoat ready at hand.'Mamma, it will rain today, right mamma?' Mannu asked excitedly. The peacock also seemed to think so and started dancing. The tortoise came out of it's hiding and looked up at the sky hoping perhaps to feel cooler after the hot summer.'I think so. Today the sky is full of black clouds.' Mamma smiled at Mannu's excitement and was happy for him.
On the Saturday morning there was a loud thunder.  And also lightening.'Mamma, it that not lightening? Now it will surely rain, right Mamma?' asked Manu.He ran out on the lawns and saw that a frog and a tortoise also had come out of their hiding.
And.. tip...tap...tip...tap... came down the raindrops!Mannu, loved the rains...raincoat or no raincoat.'Oh, it is raining; it is raining.' Thus shouting  Mannu ran out of the house and started  jumping and dancing in the rain. And he had the company of the frog who also seemed to be  waiting for the rains.
'Wait Mannu, wait.' Mamma ran after him with his raincoat in her hand. 'You forgot your raincoat!'But Mannu was very happy getting drenched in rains. The raincoat which he was holding close to himself all this time was all forgotten.

Once upon a time, there was a boy called Petros. He was a very clever student. He came first in his class and his parents were proud of him. But Petros wished he had a brother, a sister, or a pet to play with.
One day he asked his mom, "Can I play outside? I have studied all morning and I want to play with my friends now." His mom replied, "All right! Go, but don't be late!"
On the way to the playground, Petros saw something unusual. It was a little dog with white and brown spots. The dog was stuck in a hole and he was scared. "Don't worry, I won't hurt you. I will help you," said Petros.
Petros helped the dog out of the hole. He barked with joy, dancing around the boy and licking him. "You are going to be my dog," said Petros happily as they continued to the playground.
The dog ran far ahead. When Petros' friends saw the dog running towards them, they said, "This dog might be dangerous. It might bite us." They picked up stones and threw them at the little dog. Petros was running and shouting for his friends to stop.
The friends did not hear Petros. The small dog ran as fast as he could to save his life. Then he hid from the boys who were chasing him. They did not find him.
Petros' friends went back to the playground and found Petros crying. "What is wrong?" asked one of them. "You chased my dog!" cried Petros. They were shocked and said, "We didn't know it was your dog. We're sorry. Let's find him."
"It's no use. We will never find my dog," said Petros in a hopeless voice. "Yes, we will find him. Get up Petros, we will find your dog. We must not lose hope," his friends said, consoling him.
Petros and his friends searched for the dog all afternoon until they got tired. Finally, Petros said, "There is one last place where the dog could be. If we don't find him there, I will search no more. Let's go to the river."
When the dog saw the boys coming, he was scared. He tried to cross the river but he was scared of the water. He was about to jump into the river, when he heard Petros calling, "Stop, don't jump!"
The dog turned around, saw Petros and ran to him. Petros hugged the dog and the dog licked Petros's face. "My friend! I thought you were gone forever!" cried Petros.
Back at the playground, Petros gave his friends some advice. "Before you make decisions, think about what could happen as a result. Be careful of hurting others." His friends thought about his words and said, "We are sorry. The dog will be our friend too."

A young man once lived with his mother. She cooked his food and cleaned his clothes. Then the man got married and his wife moved in. At first, all went well. But then the two women began to dislike each other.
One day, the husband came home late from the fields. "I'm hungry. Where's my dinner?" he called. His wife refused to answer. "What's the matter?" he asked. His wife began to cry. "Your mother hates me. She's always rude to me. I can't live with her any longer."
The man looked at his beautiful wife. He loved her. "Please, try to live with her. She's old and won't be with us for ever. Don't talk about it now. Bring me my dinner."
His wife said, "There is no dinner! I can't cook when that old woman is here. She insults me all the time." "But what can I do?" the man said. "She's my mother. This is her home. I can't send her away." "You must choose either her or me. You can't have both of us," the wife said.
That night, the man went to bed hungry. He couldn't sleep. "What can I do?" he thought. "How can I choose between my wife and my mother? My mother has loved me always. But my wife is young and beautiful. I can't live without her."
The next morning, his wife said to him, "Well, husband? Have you chosen?"I want both of you!" said the man. "You can't have both of us," said his wife. "Kill your mother. We can have many happy years together."
The man went off to work in the fields. All day he thought about his wife and his mother. "My wife is right," he thought at last. "My mother is old. I will take her up the mountain and throw her over the cliff. Then my wife and I will be happy."
He went home from the fields. His wife asked, "Have you chosen?" "Yes, I have chosen you. Tomorrow I will take my mother up the mountain and throw her over the cliff. Now bring me dinner. I'm hungry." "Yes," said his wife, "I have cooked all your favourite dishes. When your mother is dead, I will make them for you every day."
The next day, the man said, "Mother, you and I are going up the mountain today. You will like it very much." His mother was surprised. "I'm old," she said. "I can't walk up the mountain." "I'll carry you," said her son. He carried her up. At first his mother talked happily. Her son said nothing. Soon she stopped talking.
The path went up and after a while, they reached the top of a cliff. "I understand everything my son. Throw me over, but don't fall yourself. When you push me, hold a branch of that tree. Then you will be safe." Surprised, the man said, "Mother, you know everything but you still love me!" "Only a mother knows love," she smiled sadly.
The man put his mother down and sat down beside her. He put his head in his hands and thought, "Does my wife love me as much as this?" Then he thought, "My wife is a wicked woman. I loved her once, but I don't love her now. I choose to keep my mother and send my wife away."
The man carried his mother down from the mountain. He took her home and sent his wife away. He lived happily with his mother for many years.

Once upon a time, there was a hardworking farmer. He had a hardworking wife, and two sons
He had enough food because he and his wife worked very hard. He wanted his children to have a good life. He never let them do any work.
After some time, his wife died.
The man still did not want his children to work. He did the field labour and all the housework too.
But as time went on, the man became old and sick. He started to worry about what would become of his children when he died. They would not be able to take care of themselves.
He called his sons. He said, "My inheritance to you is a lot of gold hidden in the fields. So, it's up to you to plough them and find the gold."
He also called his neighbours and said, "I'm going to die soon. My sons do not know how to look after themselves. Please look after them until they can do it for themselves."
After the man died, the neighbours provided his sons with food for some time.
The brothers did not want to be robbed of the gold their father buried. They decided to do the digging themselves.
They dug one field after another, but they did not find any gold.
They sat down and one asked the other, "Do you think our father cheated us?" The other brother said, "No, I think our father was saying that farming is gold. And if we dig the fields, plant, and plough we can become rich."
So, like all the other farmers, they dug up the fields. They grew wheat and became very rich
