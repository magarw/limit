a warm morning , Raja woke up with a yawn and said to himself "lets go for fishing now".
While going to the pond,he met Ram,his best friend and invited him to go to the pond together.
Sita saw them going for fishing. The boys asked her if she wanted to come with them.
Sita thought for a moment and said "don't do this,fishes will die when separated by water"
They didn't paid attention to her and continued on their way to the pond.
Raja and Ram sat near the pond and saw to fishes jumping in water,one was a thin and second a fat one.
There came a third fish. They didn't saw any fish bigger than this! Sita said" This fish is even bigger than my father's foot!"
Raja and Ram took their fishing rods with and struggled for the fish.Ram said"its mine!"Raja said"no,its mine!"
Raja pulled the rod, Ram pulled stronger.
BOOM! They fell down as their rods broke.
Do you know why ?Any guesses ?fished tied their strings together!
﻿There are four of us in the family. Miguel is my favorite,                              and I follow him everywhere.
I have to keep an eye on Miguel.                                 I'm older than him.
Sometimes Miguel is not careful,                         so I had to guard the house.
﻿I am with him in everything. We sympathize with everyone.
We play with each other.
And Mother scolded us too.
I help Mom when Miguel is busy.   I pimp the birds away from our wares.
Today, Miguel will teach me. Finally, I will learn something new.
I am a kind dog. I'm not chasing cats.
If you're Miguel's friend, I'm your friend too!
Read the following sentences. Which of these do you like? I love to dance. I love to swim. I love jumping rope. I love to draw.
I love cycling. I love to climb. There is a saying “Nothing is more loyal than a dog”. This is because the dog does not leave his master. Whether he goes away or gets lost, he can definitely return to his master.
I like playing with my friend Chuma.
We are good friends. When either one of us is sent somewhere, we go together.
One day, my grandmother sent me to the shop to buy salt and cooking oil. I went with Chuma.
On the way, we saw our friends playing football.
"Ah! Football!" I said. I wanted to play too.
I said to Chuma, "Let's ask if we can play with them. I like playing football very much."
Chuma replied, "Let us go to the shop first, then we can come to play."
But I replied, "Let us play first! Grandmother will not allow us to return."
We joined our friends to play. I was the goal keeper. The goal posts were made of two big stones.
I worked hard to catch the ball. My friends were not able to score any goals.
We played until the field was full of sand.
Then we went to the shop. Grandmother's money was gone! I started to cry. Chuma shouted, "Stop crying. You wanted to play first."
We returned home without salt or cooking oil. We were very dirty and worried.
Grandmother was annoyed when we got home. The first question she asked us was, "Where were you all this time?"
We had to tell her the truth. She warned, "You should never go to play without permission."
We went to feed the ducks.  Later on, we cleaned ourselves.

वाघमारे काकाचा तो वार्षिक केशकर्तन दिवस होता.   It was the Annual Haircut Day for Waghmare Kaka.
वाघमारे काका न्हाव्याकडे जाण्यासाठी घरात निघाले. Waghmare Kaka left home to go to the barber.
पण न्हावी म्हणाला, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.''But the barber said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
वाघमारे काका दुःखी झाले. ते मदत मागण्यासाठी आपल्या बायको कडे गेले.Waghmare Kaka felt sad. He went to his wife to ask for help.
पण त्यांची बायको म्हणाली, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.''   But his wife said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
थोडा रागवून, वाघमारे काका आपल्या शिंपी मित्राकडे गेले. Feeling a little angry, Waghmare Kaka went to his friend, the tailor.
पण शिंपी म्हणाला, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.'' But the tailor said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
वाघमारे काका आणखी एका मित्राकडे गेले, सुताराकडे. Waghmare Kaka went to one more friend, the carpenter.
पण सुतार म्हणाला, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.'' But the carpenter said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
बिचारे वाघमारे काका. वार्षिक केशकर्तन दिवशी त्यांचे केस कोणीच कापू शकणार नव्हते. Poor Waghmare Kaka. No one could cut his hair on this Annual             Haircut Day.
रडत रडत,  ते गावाजवळच्या जंगलात पोहोचले. Crying, he went to the forest near the village.
ते एका गुहेजवळ बसून जोरात रडायला लागले. He sat near a cave and cried loudly.
''देवा, मदत कर! कोण माझे केस कापतील?'' “Oh God, help me! Who will cut my hair?”
गुहेत शांतपणे झोपलेला वाघ त्याच्या आवाजाने जागा झाला. The tiger sleeping peacefully inside the cave was awake now.
ते वाघ जोराने गरजला आणि वाघमारे काकांवर उडी मारली!  The tiger roared loudly and jumped on Waghmare Kaka!
बिचारे वाघमारे काका इतके घाबरले, इतके घाबरले, इतके घाबरले  की ... Poor Waghmare Kaka was so scared, so scared, so scared that ...
... त्यांच्या डोक्यावरचे सगळेच केस गळून पडले! ... all the hair fell off his head!
वाघमारे काका धावत गावात आले. वाघ पुन्हा झोपायला गेला.Waghmare Kaka ran all the way back to the village.                                   The tiger went back to sleep.
आता वाघमारे काकाला खूप दिवस केस कापण्याची गरज येणारच नाही. Now, Waghmare Kaka will not need a haircut for a very long time.

On a bright sunny day, a fawn was racing in a forest.
On his way he met a rabbit, he ran past the fast runner.
Next, he met an elephant and he ran past the huge animal too.
Then came a stream, he leapt and cleared the stream feeling refreshed with the fresh and cool water.
He was still full of energy, so he ran past the crumbling wall too.
He was sure that he is going to win the race and in his excitement he missed a large boulder on the grassy plain. He stumbled and fell down.
He got hurt in his leg and was bleeding. He burst into tears.
Hearing his cry a monkey came and massaged his aching leg and the tears flowed from the fawn's eyes.
Brother bear also came and picked him up but the fawn didn't stop crying
Mama dear came running to her baby and said, "Look we'll beat up this bad boulder!"

He loves food, but he is too lazy to cook.
"Yes. Help me with stirring," says Rabbit. But Anansi is lazy.
Anansi ties some web around his leg and to Rabbit's pot.
"Monkeys, can I share your beans?" "Yes. Help us with chopping."
"Warthog, can I share your potatoes?" "Yes. Help me with preparing."
Soon,  each of Anansi's 8 legs is tied to a pot.
All 8 legs are being pulled! "Stop pulling!" cries Anansi.
Anansi's legs stretched! And so all spiders have long thin legs.
A long time ago, three girls went out to collect wood.
It was a hot day so they went down to the river to swim. They played and splashed and swam in the water.
Suddenly, they realised that it was late. They hurried back to the village.
When they were nearly home, Nozibele put her hand to her neck. She had forgotten her necklace! "Please come back with me!" she begged her friends. But her friends said it was too late.
Nozibele went back to the river alone. She found her necklace and began hurrying home. But, she got lost in the dark.
In the distance she saw light coming from a hut. She walked quickly towards it and knocked at the door.
To her surprise, a dog opened the door and said, "What do you want?" "I'm lost and I need a place to sleep," said Nozibele. "Come in, or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele went in.
The dog said, "Cook for me!" "But I've never cooked for a dog before," Nozibele answered. "Cook, or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele cooked some food for the dog.
Then the dog said, "Make the bed for  me!" Nozibele answered, "I've never made a bed for a dog." "Make the bed, or I'll bite you!" the dog said. Nozibele made the bed.
Every day she had to cook and sweep and wash for the dog. Then one day the dog said, "Nozibele, today I have to visit some friends. Sweep the house, cook the food and wash my things before I come back."
As soon as the dog had gone, Nozibele took three hairs from her head. She put one hair under the bed, one behind the door, and one in the kraal. Then she ran home as fast as she could.
When the dog came back, he looked for Nozibele. "Nozibele, where are you?" he shouted. "I'm here, under the bed," said the first hair. "I'm here, behind the door," said the second hair. "I'm here, in the kraal," said the third hair.
The dog knew that Nozibele had tricked him. He ran and ran all the way to the village. But Nozibele's brothers were waiting there with big sticks. The dog turned and ran away and has never been seen since.
I wonder ifthere's another me somewhere in the world.
Who looks thesame.
And talks thesame.
And even has mycurls.
Someone with myeyes my ears.
Who even has mylaugh.
Who can do what Ican do.
And can't do whatI can't.
I've looked andlooked everywhere to find another me. I went down to the park and looked behindthe trees.
I looked around,up and down.
At every singleface.
I couldn't find anotherme in any single place.
There's only oneme in the world! I'm special, oh it's true!
But not just me,don't you see? There's only one of you!
Once upon a time, there lived a group of children near a huge city. There was a large park near their houseThe park was very strange. It had no trees, no plants - only garbage and waste!The whole city's trash was dumped in the park.
The children did not go to school. They spent their days roaming and playing in the park.They would find plastic bottles and bits of cloth from the garbage.Thus, they knew a lot about garbage!
One day, Didi arrived at the garbage-filled park. She wore a red scarf around her neck.Looking at the roaming children, she sat at a place near them.She took something out from her bag and started looking at it.
At first, the children stared from a distance. Gradually they crept closer to have a better look.Didi had a lot of books! Thick ones, thin ones, colorful and full of stories!The children kept creeping closer to Didi, attracted to what they saw.
Didi came to the park each day. The children too kept on visiting her regularly.They listened to lots of stories from her and in no time they could read letters and words as well!Gradually, they were able to read the stories too.
The children decided to improve the place where Didi sat. They found a table and a chair from the garbage for her.One brought a mat, another brought a curtain. Bits and pieces of things were brought whenever they were found.
One day Didi did not come. She did not appear the next day either.The anxious children kept on waiting for her.Talking among themselves, they started reading. Gradually they started teaching each other too!
One day the children found Didi's address in a book. Immediately they set out to find her, taking the bag of books along with them.In their search, they read and understood a bus' number. Next, a road's name was spoken out loud by them, since Didi had taught them everything!
Where is Didi's house? Is it there or over there?A long search exhausted the children. They were about to give up and return when someone saw a red scarf!
Didi was lying on a bed. She was ill and looked sad.She had no smile, no glow on her face. The doctor had given her medicines but she was not getting well.
The children ran to her and hugged her dearly.They showed her the bag of books and read out loud to her.Didi started to smile and her face brightened up. Her eyes started to glow.
Didi has started to come again. The children have all started to gather again too!They meet each evening. They laugh a lot and read even more. Together, they have fun - Didi, her children and their books!
For many months, the skies were dry. Lomongin, the famous rain-maker, talked to his gods. People gathered outside his home, anxiously waiting for a message of hope.
When he came out, he assured people that the creator was going to give them rain soon. They would be able to plant their crops.
Children played outside as we waited for the rains. Later that day, we saw big white clouds in the far east. I knew they were rain clouds.
People were still thinking about what the rain-maker said. Mother shouted loudly, "There! The clouds are now dark. Come inside."
The rain poured down.
We had waited for the rains! At first we rejoiced. But the rains did not stop.
There was water everywhere. The bridge linking our village to the mainland was washed away.
Houses were washed away by floods. What was a blessing, was now a disaster for us.
Everybody had prepared for planting. But now they could not plant. People of my village had longed for rain but now they did not want it anymore. We had no bridge to cross on. Many had no homes.
And, we had another problem! We saw crocodiles swimming everywhere. This had never happened before. We were confused.
We could not go shopping because all the shops were across the river. Children couldn't go to school because schools were across the river.
What should have been a blessing, became a curse to us. Lomongin, the rain-maker, was disappointed as well. The only one who was happy, was Kapuus with his eight cats!

'Wov! What a lovely raincoat!' Mannu danced happily holding the shining red raincoat that his parents had bought for him.'Mamma, may I wear the raincoat now?' Manu asked his mother.Mamma said, 'No, my child. You can wear it when it rains. It should start raining soon. But as of now I don't see any signs of the rain.'
But, Monday was a bright sunny day, full of golden sunshine.Mannu looked out of the window every now and then and asked his mother,'Mamma, will it rain today?'Mamma  peeped out of the window and said, ' I don't think it will rain today. You cannot wear the raincoat today. People will laugh at you, if you do.'
On Tuesday also Mannu kept looking at the sky. And the raincoat was kept right next to him, ready to be used. But the sky was a nice blue and as bright as it was on Monday.Mannu was disappointed,'Mamma, when will I be able to use the raincoat?''There is just a single cloud in the sky today, and that too a white one. I don't think you will get a chance to wear the raincoat today.'Mamma said.
Wednesday again was a very hot sunny day.Mannu was getting worried, 'Mamma, why is it not raining yet?'He tried to put the raincoat on at home. But had to immediately take it off because he felt too hot in it.Mamma, in her eagerness to comfort him said, 'I think it will rain soon, probably by afternoon.'
On Thursday, there was the school picnic. Mannu was eager to show off the raincoat to his school buddies.'Mamma, shall I carry the raincoat to the picnic. What if it rains there?' Mannu asked.'Don't, my pet. It will not rain today. See those white clouds? And they are also so far away.' Mamma tried to comfort him.
And... at last  on Friday, the sky looked quite dark with black clouds. Mannu kept the raincoat ready at hand.'Mamma, it will rain today, right mamma?' Mannu asked excitedly. The peacock also seemed to think so and started dancing. The tortoise came out of it's hiding and looked up at the sky hoping perhaps to feel cooler after the hot summer.'I think so. Today the sky is full of black clouds.' Mamma smiled at Mannu's excitement and was happy for him.
On the Saturday morning there was a loud thunder.  And also lightening.'Mamma, it that not lightening? Now it will surely rain, right Mamma?' asked Manu.He ran out on the lawns and saw that a frog and a tortoise also had come out of their hiding.
And.. tip...tap...tip...tap... came down the raindrops!Mannu, loved the rains...raincoat or no raincoat.'Oh, it is raining; it is raining.' Thus shouting  Mannu ran out of the house and started  jumping and dancing in the rain. And he had the company of the frog who also seemed to be  waiting for the rains.
'Wait Mannu, wait.' Mamma ran after him with his raincoat in her hand. 'You forgot your raincoat!'But Mannu was very happy getting drenched in rains. The raincoat which he was holding close to himself all this time was all forgotten.

Long long ago people didn't know anything. They didn't know how to plant crops, or how to weave cloth, or how to make iron tools.The god Nyame up in the sky had all the wisdom of the world. He kept it safe in a clay pot.
One day, Nyame decided that he would give the pot of wisdom to Anansi. Every time Anansi looked in the clay pot, he learnedsomething new. It was so exciting!
Greedy Anansi thought, "I'll keep the pot safe at the top of a tall tree. Then I can have it all to myself!" He spun a long thread, wound it round the clay pot, and tied it to his stomach. He began to climb the tree. But it was hard climbing the tree with the pot bumping him in the knees all the time.
All the time Anansi's young son had been standing at the bottom of the tree watching. He said, "Wouldn't it be easier to climb if you tied the pot to your back instead?" Anansi tried tying the clay pot full of wisdom to his back, and it really was a lot easier.
In no time he reached the top of the tree. But then he stopped and thought, "I'm supposed to be the one with all the wisdom, and here my son was cleverer than me!" Anansi was so angry about this that he threw the clay pot down out of the tree.
It smashed into pieces on the ground. The wisdom was free for everyone to share.And that is how people learned to farm, to weavecloth, to make iron tools, and all the other things that people know how to do.
I am a big boy now.
I can climb up the steps.
But I cannot climb down again.
I can climb on a chair.
But I cannot climb down again.
I climb on to the chair, and then on the table!
But I cannot climb down again.
“Papa! Papa!” I shout. Papa laughs. “Sonu, learn to climb down!” he says.
I am afraid. But I do not cry.
Slowly, I get down from the table, and down from the chair.
At last, I have learnt to climb down too!
It's not easy being a tiger.Yes, tigers are beautiful and fierce.

Where is my red ball now?
It is up.

It is high up in the sky.
It is high up in the sky. It is over the moon. It is gone!
In a village, there was a young boy whose name was Abula. He did not like to read or even to open a book. He was a lazy pupil. He behaved badly.
Abula stole his mother's money to buy sweets. Even when she hid her money, he found it and took it.After eating all his sweets, Abula would play with his friends.
After a while, Abula stopped going to school. He stayed out playing the whole day, only returning home in the evening. Abula's mother noticed this and became worried.
"Our son is not behaving well. I do not think he is attending school. He is also stealing money from me," said Abula's mother.
He said to his wife, "Next time, hide the money within the pages of a book. He never even opens a book, so the money will be safe there."
The next day, Abula looked for his mother's money. He searched everywhere but he did not find anything. He decided to go to the nearest market to find some money.
His father saw where Abula was going. "My son, I know why you are going to the market. Now go back inside and look in the books for money," he said.
Abula was puzzled, but he went and searched in the books. He found the money that his mother had hidden.
The next day, he looked in the books again. But there was nothing hidden there. He went to his father to ask why there was no money in the books.
His father smiled and replied, "My son, do you want to get enough money to buy many sweets?"  Abula answered, "Of course, father."
His father said, "Listen to me carefully. Read your books and attend your classes. You will find rewards in books. Do not give up." "But father, reading is a difficult activity. Books are boring!" Abula replied.
For a while, Abula's father was quiet. He thought about how to encourage his son. Then he said to Abula, "Let us read together. I will help you to find the wealth in books."
My little brother sleeps late. I wake early,  because I am great!
I am the one who lets in the sun.
"You're my morning star," says Ma.
I wash myself every day,  I don't need any help.
I don't mind cold water, or the blue soap that washes clothes.
Ma reminds,  "Don't forget your teeth." I reply,  "Never,  not me!"
After washing,  I greet Grandpa and Auntie. I wish them a good day.
Then I dress myself.  "I'm big now, Ma," I say.
I can close my buttons and buckle my shoes.
I make sure my brother knows all the school news.
In class I do my best in every way.
I do all these good things every day. But the thing I like most,  is to play and play!
I love my teacher.
She is a good teacher. She is kind and patient.
She has braided her hair so nicely.
She has put colourful beads in her hair.
Her beads are green, white, red, and yellow.
Mom, please would you braid my hair like my teacher's?
When I am older I will put beads in my hair.
I will grow up to be just like my teacher!

Once upon a time, there lived two sisters, Nelima and Nambuya. Their parents were dead. They lived on bare land. There was neither rain nor crops. Whoever wanted food had to go a long distance to find it.
Nelima was a humble, quiet and helpful girl. Her sister Nambuya was proud and did not listen to advice. She did not care about other people.
One day, the two sisters had nothing to eat. They would have to look for food. So Nelima and Nambuya went off in different directions.
Meanwhile, there lived an old woman called Netasile. She was believed to be a giver of riches. Netasile had leprosy and her body was full of sores.
Nambuya came across Netasile. Netasile called the Nambuya, "My daughter, how are you? Where do you come from? Where are you going?"
Nambuya answered all the questions. Then the Netasile said, "Come help me to go to my house and I will tell you what to do."
Nambuya was rude to the woman. She said, "I would rather die than touch those sores of yours." Netasile kept quiet and wished Nambuya a safe journey.
Nambuya walked for a long time. She reached a place where there were snakes, millipedes, caterpillars and other insects. She was very tired and weak from hunger. When she sat down to rest, she fell asleep. The insects began to bite her.
On her journey, Nelima came to the same old woman. She was happy to see Netasile, who was the first person she met since starting her journey. Netasile asked the same questions as she asked Nambuya.
Nelima agreed to help Netasile. "You have done what others failed to do," said the old woman. She told Nelima to go back home. There she would find everything she wanted.
Nelima was very grateful and thanked the old woman. She ran back home and found a new house with everything in it, and a lot of food. She was now rich.
But Nelima mourned the loss of her sister, Nambuya. She said to herself, "One who did not listen to advice ended up in an elephant's mouth."

Ammu did not have a puppy.But she told everyone in school that she did.
"My puppy’s name is Simba," she told Venu."Simba eats bananas," she told Abdul."Simba is black," she told Kumari."Simba plays ball with me," she told Unni.
So Venu, Abdul, Kumari, and Unni told Ammu that they would come home.To see Simba. Ammu shook her head."You can’t," she said.
"Why?" they asked."Because Simba is scared of crowds," said Ammu."Then we’ll play with him one by one," said Kumari.
"You can’t," Ammu said."Why?" asked Unni."Because we’re going out today," said Ammu.
"Then we’ll come tomorrow," said Abdul."We’ll bring bananas for him," said Venu."We’ll play with him one by one," said Kumari."Okay," said Ammu.  She didn’t know what else to say.
That evening, Ammu asked Achan if he would buy a puppy for her."We’ll see," said Achan."But it’s urgent," said Ammu. Achan laughed. Ammu didn’t eat dinner. She felt sick.
She didn’t want to think about tomorrow.  In the morning, Amma said, "You look ill."She touched Ammu’s forehead. A fever!
"Stay at home today," Amma said.So Ammu skipped school.She lay in bed all day. She didn’t smile at all.All she ate was a slice of bread.
In the evening, Venu, Abdul, Kumari, and Unni came home."Why didn’t you come to school today?" asked Unni."I am sick," said Ammu.
"We saw Simba," said Abdul."Where?" asked Ammu."In the garden," said Kumari.
"He didn’t want to play ball," said Abdul.Suddenly, Ammu got up from bed. She ran outside.
It was true. There was a puppy in her garden. Simba!"But he’s not black," said Venu. "He’s brown.’""Oh," said Ammu. "I made that up!"
"He’s not afraid of crowds," said Abdul."Oh," said Ammu. "I made that up!"
"He doesn’t like playing ball," said Unni."Oh," said Ammu. "I made that up!"
"But he loves bananas," said Kumari."I told you, didn’t I?" smiled Ammu happily.

The sun rises in the morning, by the east side.I hear the cock crow at dawn.
The sun moves over Terfa's compound before the morning meal.I smell the aroma of bier and akpupa following the sun to my window.
The sun goes behind a tree at school during lunchtime. Then it arrives in a puddle in the middle of the playground.
The sun stands above my head. My shadow stands beside me. I play the shadow game with my friends.
My shadow grows bigger, then smaller. We run after it.My shadow grows longer, then shorter. We run after it.
I stand, my friends stand. We see our shadows sway. We grow tired and return to class. After school, we go home.
The sun yawns. I see the sun sink slowly in the west. I see my shadow on a wall. It is time to go to bed.
The sun goes down behind the clouds.I lay down in my bed, and dream of the sun traveling afar.
Long time ago, animals had no legs. They all used to crawl.
Only people had legs, which Maguru gave to them.
One day, Maguru decided to give legs to every animal. He wanted them to walk. He told them about it.
The animals said, "It will be very nice to have legs." They sang and danced.
The animals said it was hard to crawl.They felt pain.
When the day came, many animals went to Maguru's house. Giraffes, lions, elephants, rabbits, crocodiles and birds stood in a line.
Each animal was given four legs. Birds were given two legs each.
Everything was different after they got legs. Some danced for joy.Others fell down.
They went to show people.The animals said, "We will never crawl again."
The last one in the line was Millipede. Maguru asked, "Is thereanyone else after you?"Millipede answered, "No, I am the last one."
Maguru thought, "He is the last one. What will I do with the rest of the legs?" Maguru gave Millipede all the remaining legs.
Millipede was very happy. He said, "I will move faster than others."
After Millipede left, Snake came to Maguru's house. He said to Maguru, "Please give me some legs."
Maguru said, "I have given out all the legs.Where were you?" Snake answered, "I overslept."
Maguru looked to see if there were legs remaining.He did not find any.
Maguru said to Snake,"Sorry, There are no legs left." Snake crawled home without legs. From that day, Snake does not sleep much. He is waiting to be first in line to get legs.

There was a boy whose name was Abel. He made himself a cart. Abel had no driver for his new cart. He said to his sister Meri, "I want a driver for my cart. Please give me your doll. She can sit in the cart."
But Meri said, "No, I want my doll." When Meri would not let him take the doll, Abel was very angry. He grabbed the doll and pulled her. Meri pulled the doll's other arm. Abel pulled and Meri pulled. The doll's arm came off!
Meri cried and ran to her mother. "Look Mother," she said, "Abel pulled my doll's arm and it came off. He wanted my doll to sit in his new cart but I wanted to play with her." Her mother said, "Abel did not behave well."
Mother thought about how to teach her son not to touch his sister's toys. She had an idea. She went to her friend who was a doctor and she asked, "I want you to help me please." The doctor replied, "How can I help, my friend?"
Mother answered, "My son Abel is behaving badly these days. He pulled the arm off his sister's doll. He must not do that. Tomorrow I will tell him to bring the doll to you to put the doll's arm on again."
"Please tell Abel that he must pay you for your work. He doesn't have any money, so you will tell him to clean your big old car that is always dusty," said mother. Her friend laughed and said, "Ee–ee! That will be good."
Abel's mother went back to her house. She asked Abel, "When you are ill or hurt where do you go?" Abel answered, "When I am ill or hurt, I must go to the doctor." Abel's mother said, "You hurt the doll, now you must take her to the doctor."
So Abel took the doll to the doctor. "This doll is hurt very badly. My mother told me to bring the doll to you. Doctor, can you give her a new arm?" The doctor agreed to look after the doll. She was able to make a new arm.
The doctor said to Abel, "The doll has a new arm. You must pay me. How much money do you have?" Abel answered, "Please doctor, I don't have any money. I can't pay you for your work."
The doctor said, "Well! You don't have any money? My big car is very dirty! Clean my car and that is how you will pay me." Abel got a bucket of water and a clean cloth. It took a long time to wash that dusty car.
Then Abel took the doll back to Meri. She was delighted and she said to Abel, "You are a good brother. Thank you for fixing my doll." "My sister, I'm sorry for getting angry and making you sad," said Abel.
From that day, Abel never took his sister's things again. And he tried his best not to get angry with her.Abel remembered how long it took him to wash the doctor's big, dirty car. He decided it wasn't worth the price to get angry and break things.

A woman with her baby went into the forest. She went to pick fruit.
In the forest she found a tree with ripe fruit.
She put down her sleeping baby and climbed the tree.
An erotot from another community came by. He saw the baby. He was surprised. He asked himself, "Where is the mother?"
He bent down. The sound of the chains on his neck woke the baby.
He let the baby play with his chains. The baby laughed as he played.
The woman looked down to see why the baby was laughing. She saw the stranger.
She was so afraid that she dropped her bag of fruit.
The erotot looked up. He said, "Don't be afraid. I'm only playing with your beautiful baby."
So the woman came down from the tree.
The erotot took off one of his chains. He gave it to the baby. "Here is a gift for you," he said.
"Go home with your baby. Tell your husband to move to a more peaceful village. Your baby has given me peace," said the erotot.

She walked over hills and valleys.
She came to a place named Tirkol.
Monkey was very happy in this place.
She ate fruit and got fat. But she missed her friends.
So Monkey made the long journey home.
The other monkeys were joyful to see her.
"Where is this wonderful place with fruit?" they asked her.
"I will take you there," said Monkey.
The other monkeys loved Tirkol. They decided to stay there forever.
But the monkeys from Tirkol were worried.
"These new monkeys will eat all our fruit," they said.
The Tirkol monkeys went to attack the new monkeys.
"Why fight?" asked an elder. "There is enough fruit for all!"
This was true. So the monkeys decided to live together peacefully.

Anil became very angry. He was angry on his mother too.
" Let's go to the market and let's buy you something," said the mother.
Even after going to the market Anil was very angry. "I want that" he kept showing his finger while looking at the orange."No, no! Not that! All the fruits will fall down!" Said the fruit vendor.
"I want that book" said Anil."No, no! Not that! Take this." Said the shopkeeper.

Too big to wear her old pink frock.Too small to make dosas at the stove.
Too big to climb up on Dadu’s back?Too smallto carry the baby on hers?

I find myself still standing with my brush in my hand, And I smile and think of my secret little land.

“Where do you live?” asks Crocodile. “In the trees,” says Ape.
“Can you swim?” asks Crocodile.
“I cannot swim,” says Ape. “I can teach you.”
“We are friends. Do not be afraid,” says Crocodile.
“Ape, my uncle is sick. He needs meat,” says Crocodile.
Ape is very afraid.Will Crocodile eat her?
Ape wants to escape from Crocodile.
Ape has an idea.
“I will give you my heart for him,” Ape promises.
“My heart is in a tree on the land,” says Ape.
“Will you fetch your heart?” asks Crocodile. “Yes,” says Ape.
Crocodile swims back to the land. Ape runs to the trees.
“You are not my friend. You lied!” says Crocodile.
“We are not friends. You want to eat me!” says Ape.
Leopard was always trying to catch Antelope.
And Antelope was always escaping from Leopard.
One day,  Leopard called out to Antelope,  "Let's be friends. What you eat,  I don't eat. Nothing makes us enemies."
Antelope agreed. So Leopard said,  "Let's make an oath to be friends. If either of us breaks the oath,  her child will die."
They made an oath to be friends. At night,  Antelope slept under a tree. Leopard slept in the branches above.
Antelope soon became fat. Leopard became thin.
Leopard was tempted to eat fat Antelope. She said to herself,  "I don't care about the oath. I don't even have a child!"
Leopard jumped down to catch Antelope. But she got caught between two branches.
Antelope was shocked. She leaped up and cried,  "Beh! Beh!"
Leopard begged,  "My friend,  help me. We agreed that whoever broke our oath to be friends,  would lose a child."
Antelope replied,  "It must have been your parent who made the oath. Now it is meant for you!"

वाघमारे काकाचा तो वार्षिक केशकर्तन दिवस होता.   It was the Annual Haircut Day for Waghmare Kaka.
वाघमारे काका न्हाव्याकडे जाण्यासाठी घरात निघाले. Waghmare Kaka left home to go to the barber.
पण न्हावी म्हणाला, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.''But the barber said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
वाघमारे काका दुःखी झाले. ते मदत मागण्यासाठी आपल्या बायको कडे गेले.Waghmare Kaka felt sad. He went to his wife to ask for help.
पण त्यांची बायको म्हणाली, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.''   But his wife said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
थोडा रागवून, वाघमारे काका आपल्या शिंपी मित्राकडे गेले. Feeling a little angry, Waghmare Kaka went to his friend, the tailor.
पण शिंपी म्हणाला, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.'' But the tailor said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
वाघमारे काका आणखी एका मित्राकडे गेले, सुताराकडे. Waghmare Kaka went to one more friend, the carpenter.
पण सुतार म्हणाला, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.'' But the carpenter said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
बिचारे वाघमारे काका. वार्षिक केशकर्तन दिवशी त्यांचे केस कोणीच कापू शकणार नव्हते. Poor Waghmare Kaka. No one could cut his hair on this Annual             Haircut Day.
रडत रडत,  ते गावाजवळच्या जंगलात पोहोचले. Crying, he went to the forest near the village.
ते एका गुहेजवळ बसून जोरात रडायला लागले. He sat near a cave and cried loudly.
''देवा, मदत कर! कोण माझे केस कापतील?'' “Oh God, help me! Who will cut my hair?”
गुहेत शांतपणे झोपलेला वाघ त्याच्या आवाजाने जागा झाला. The tiger sleeping peacefully inside the cave was awake now.
ते वाघ जोराने गरजला आणि वाघमारे काकांवर उडी मारली!  The tiger roared loudly and jumped on Waghmare Kaka!
बिचारे वाघमारे काका इतके घाबरले, इतके घाबरले, इतके घाबरले  की ... Poor Waghmare Kaka was so scared, so scared, so scared that ...
... त्यांच्या डोक्यावरचे सगळेच केस गळून पडले! ... all the hair fell off his head!
वाघमारे काका धावत गावात आले. वाघ पुन्हा झोपायला गेला.Waghmare Kaka ran all the way back to the village.                                   The tiger went back to sleep.
आता वाघमारे काकाला खूप दिवस केस कापण्याची गरज येणारच नाही. Now, Waghmare Kaka will not need a haircut for a very long time.

When Simbegwire's mother died,  she was very sad. Simbegwire's father did his best to take care of his daughter. Slowly,  they learned to feel happy again,  without Simbegwire's mother. Every morning they sat and talked about the day ahead. Every evening they made dinner together. After they washed the dishes,  Simbegwire's father helped her with homework.
One day,  Simbegwire's father came home later than usual. "Where are you my child?" he called. Simbegwire ran to her father. She stopped still when she saw that he was holding a woman's hand. "I want you to meet someone special,  my child. This is Anita," he said smiling.
"Hello Simbegwire,  your father told me a lot about you," said Anita. But she did not smile or take the girl's hand. Simbegwire's father was happy and excited. He talked about the three of them living together,  and how good their life would be. "My child,  I hope you will accept Anita as your mother," he said.
Simbegwire's life changed. She no longer had time to sit with her father in the mornings. Anita gave her so many household chores that she was too tired to do her school work in the evenings. She went straight to bed after dinner. Her only comfort was the colourful blanket her mother gave her. Simbegwire's father did not seem to notice that his daughter was unhappy.
After a few months,  Simbegwire's father told them that he would be away from home for a while. "I have to travel for my job," he said. "But I know you will look after each other." Simbegwire's face fell,  but her father did not notice. Anita did not say anything. She was not happy either.
Things got worse for Simbegwire. If she didn't finish her chores,  or she complained,  Anita hit her. And at dinner,  the woman ate most of the food,  leaving Simbegwire with only a few scraps. Each night Simbegwire cried herself to sleep,  hugging her mother's blanket.
One morning,  Simbegwire was late getting out of bed. "You lazy girl!" Anita shouted. She pulled Simbegwire out of bed. The precious blanket caught on a nail,  and tore in two.
Simbegwire was very upset. She decided to run away from home. She took the pieces of her mother's blanket,  packed some food,  and left the house. She followed the road her father had taken.
When it came to evening,  she climbed a tall tree near a stream and made a bed for herself in the branches. As she went to sleep,  she sang: Maama,  maama,  maama,  you left me. You left me and never came back. Father doesn't love me anymore. Mother,  when are you coming back? You left me.
The next morning,  Simbegwire sang the song again. When the women came to wash their clothes at the stream,  they heard the sad song coming from the tall tree. They thought it was only the wind rustling the leaves,  and carried on with their work. But one of the women listened very carefully to the song.
This woman looked up into the tree. When she saw the girl and the pieces of colourful blanket,  she cried,  "Simbegwire,  my brother's child!" The other women stopped washing and helped Simbegwire to climb down from the tree. Her aunt hugged the little girl and tried to comfort her.
Simbegwire's aunt took the child to her own house. She gave Simbegwire warm food,  and tucked her in bed with her mother's blanket. That night,  Simbegwire cried as she went to sleep. But they were tears of relief. She knew her aunt would look after her.
When Simbegwire's father returned home,  he found her room empty. "What happened,  Anita?" he asked with a heavy heart. The woman explained that Simbegwire had run away. "I wanted her to respect me," she said. "But perhaps I was too strict." Simbegwire's father left the house and went in the direction of the stream. He continued to his sister's village to find out if she has seen Simbegwire.
Simbegwire was playing with her cousins when she saw her father from far away. She was scared he might be angry,  so she ran inside the house to hide. But her father went to her and said,  "Simbegwire,  you have found a perfect mother for yourself. One who loves you and understands you. I am proud of you and I love you." They agreed that Simbegwire would stay with her aunt as long as she wanted to.
Her father visited her every day. Eventually,  he came with Anita. She reached out for Simbegwire's hand. "I'm so sorry little one,  I was wrong," she cried. "Will you let me try again?" Simbegwire looked at her father and his worried face. Then she stepped forward slowly and put her arms around Anita.
The next week,  Anita invited Simbegwire,  with her cousins and aunt,  to the house for a meal. What a feast! Anita prepared all of Simbegwire's favourite foods,  and everyone ate until they were full. Then the children played while the adults talked. Simbegwire felt happy and brave. She decided that soon,  very soon,  she would return home to live with her father and her stepmother.

One special Friday Yusuf's father gets dressed before a flicker of light brightens the sky. He pulls on his heavy weather-proof jacket and the green woolen cap that covers his ears. He waves his boy goodbye. Yusuf's eyes brighten when Papa says,  "Today is the day I will catch a fish and bring a gift home for you."
A fish and a gift? Oh,  what will it be? Papa cycles down to Muizenberg Beach. Squeak squeak go the wheels all the way to Surfer's Corner. Gulls circle the sky. "Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?" they cry. "What will you bring back for Yusuf?" Papa rings his bell. "Wait and see what it will be!"
The fishermen watch the sun rise. They check their nets. They check their oars. They listen to the wind. They drag their boats down to the water. Yusuf's grandfather,  Oupa Salie was a treknet fisherman. Before him his father,  Oupagrootjie Ridwaan,  knew the sea too.
The boat rides into the waves. Papa's arms stretch to the oar. His leg braces against the side. His neck strains,  his back muscles ripple. Papa sings as he works: "Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don't you stop."
All day long Yusuf looks at the sky. It is bright and clear and windless. A fish and a gift! What will Papa bring home from the sea? Sometimes he brings a beautiful shell. Sometimes he brings a jewel green bottle rinsed by the waves.
Some days Yusuf's father brings a story. Like the time they found sea turtles on the sand,  hundreds washed up in a storm. "Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?" cried the gulls. "What will you do to help the turtles?"  Papa said,  "We saved those turtles,  I tell you straight. We sent them back to the ocean,  every last one."
Always Papa brings a song. He sings the song while he pulls the oars. He sings the song while he pulls the nets. He sings the song as he winds the ropes. He sings the song as he cycles home. "Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don't you stop."
Ouma Safiya wants a nice fat yellowtail for her supper. "But we'll be lucky if they catch even a tiny crab. More likely it will be fish tail Friday. There's not so many fish left in the sea," says Ouma shaking her head.  Yusuf holds Ouma's hand. They cross the road at the bathing cabins."Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?" cry the gulls perched on the bright rooftops. "What is for supper?"
Last year the fishermen fought with the surfers. Angry fists and shouting words. "Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?" cried the gulls. "There's enough sea for everybody," said Yusuf's father. He showed them the fishing license that had been Oupa Salie's. "Waves for all. Water for free."
Ouma Safiya watches through her binoculars,  her fingers curled in curiosity. The shark siren sounds. Swimmers run back to the sand and grab their towels. Surfers rush to the shore,  carrying their boards under their arms. Under the showers they strip off their wetsuits. "Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?" cry the gulls. "What will Yusuf's father bring from the ocean?"
Yusuf's father and uncle and cousins heave and pull. A little shark has been caught. It twists and thrashes in the waves. Yusuf's father untangles the nets,  singing to the shark: "Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don't you stop."  When the shark at last is free it streaks back into the waves,  leaving only one fat yellowtail in the net. Ouma Safiya will be pleased.
The men pull the boat in and coil up the cables. A hard white triangle catches Papa's finger. "Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?" cry the gulls. "What did you bring back for Yusuf?" As the sun goes down,  Papa answers the gulls. "A lucky shark tooth for my boy." At home Yusuf holds his gift up to the stars.

Long time ago, there was a man called Kato. He lived in Kabuusu town. He stayed with his dog in a small house.
One day Kato was very sick. He had no one to help him. When he recovered, he decided he would marry a woman who lived nearby.
He invited friends and relatives to attend the marriage ceremony. Kato was very excited because he thought he was getting a helper.
Many things were brought for the bride and her groom. These were baskets of millet, mats, bananas,  groundnuts, and other gifts for the home.
The wedding function ended and all the visitors left for their homes. Kato was ready to start a new life with his wife and the dog.
The next day, Kato served sweet banana to his wife, but she refused to eat.
When Kato went out to hunt, the woman ate all the sweet bananas.
Kato came back from hunting and he was hungry. He asked for sweet bananas. His wife said that the dog had eaten them all!
The following day, Kato went to his farm. When he came home, he found that his wife had eaten all the meat. She did not even share with the dog.
Another day, Kato went to visit his friend and when he came back, the woman had eaten all the groundnuts. The basket was completely empty. Kato was annoyed with his new wife.
Kato thought, "Something is wrong with this woman." He decided to apply magic. He put milk in a magic pot, put the pot under the bed, and went out hunting.
The woman saw the pot, and that it was full of milk. At once, she picked up the pot and put it to her mouth. She drank all the milk while the dog watched her.
Unfortunately, the pot got stuck to her mouth. She tried to remove the pot but all in vain. She shouted, and jumped up and down. But the pot stayed stuck. The dog watched all this.
Then the dog ran off to find Kato. The dog barked and barked, and jumped up and down. Kato realised that something was wrong at home.
They ran home together. Kato was very surprised to find his wife with a pot stuck to her mouth. He looked at her and wondered.
Kato touched his wife's cheek and the pot dropped down at once. The woman was very ashamed. She decided to go back to her parents' home.
A bajaj is a three-wheeled vehicle. It is used in town to move fast from place to place.
In our community, driving is a male-dominated activity.  Females are usually not involved in it.
One day, Abebech asked her parents to give her money to take driving lessons. Her parents said to her, "This work is not good for girls. What would people say?"
However, Abebech said, "I have the ability to do anything other people do." She convinced them.  Her parents permitted her to start taking driving lessons.
Abebech successfully completed the training. Her parents discussed what to do next.
Afterwards they agreed to buy a bajaj for her. So, Abebech started to drive a bajaj on Debre Birhan roads.
One day Abebech had a great idea. She posted at the back of her bajaj a notice with her phone number on it.
The notice read, "I transport for free, pregnant women, mothers who have delivered, and children."Women and mothers whose children got sick all called Abebech.
Abebech earned money by transporting people. She continued to give free service to people who did not have money.

We often gathered at grandmother's house to listen to her stories. We liked to sit around the fire, under the stars on a cow skin. Grandmother began her last story for the night, "Hare and Elephant were neighbours and friends."
Hare liked mushrooms, but he was too lazy to farm. So he stole Elephant's mushrooms. Elephant had planted bananas and pumpkins that year. So there were no mushrooms for Hare.
Hare went without food for many days. Then he decided to steal Elephant's bananas. Elephant noticed that someone was stealing his bananas. He went to Hare and said, "Someone is stealing from me."
Hare asked, "Who is the thief?" Elephant began to sing,  "I will catch the thief! Aaah! I will catch the thief! Ooo!"  Hare felt nervous.
Elephant asked Monkey to watch his farm. But Hare did not steal that day or that night. Nor the next day or night. Monkey became tired of watching.
The following day, Hare went to Elephant's farm to steal again. When Elephant came to check on his crops, Hare hid amongst the pumpkin leaves.
Elephant saw leaves move and began singing, "I've caught the thief! Aah! I've caught the thief! Ooo!" Elephant searched everywhere but did not find the thief.
On another day, Hare was there helping himself to Elephant's crops. Elephant arrived at the farm and Hare jumped inside a huge pumpkin to hide.
Elephant noticed the large pumpkin and said, "Ooo! Here is a big pumpkin. I'll eat that for lunch." And he swallowed the pumpkin whole!
Hare tried to jump out of the pumpkin, but could not. Elephant felt something jumping in his stomach and said, "What kind of pumpkin is this that jumps in my stomach?"
Elephant spat out the pumpkin. Before he could examine it, Hare burst out of the pumpkin and ran away as fast as he could. Elephant never caught the thief.
Grandmother said, "And that is the end of the story." "Thank you grandmother," we sleepily chorused. Then we went to bed thinking about grandmother's stories.
In Miwa Forest, there lived a monkey who was always sad. This was because every time she had a baby, it died.
The pain of losing her babies made Monkey jump up and down. She would jump to one branch, then to another, and cry out, "Kwi! Kwi! Kwi!"
Monkey was sadder when she saw other monkeys with their babies.
The sad monkey sat on a branch. Days passed and she cried more and more.
Then she gave birth again. She decided to take the baby to the path.She wanted people passing by, to see the baby and wish it well.
Monkey put her baby on the path. At that time, a hunter was returning home. He saw the baby monkey lying on the side of the path.
The hunter carried the baby monkey to his house. When the hunter reached home, his three sons wanted to hold the baby monkey.
The boys sang: Throw it up! Throw it down! Throw it to me! Throw it to him! The baby monkey was thrown from one child to the other.
