“What about these?” “No, we won’t needbiscuits. We can savethose for aftersupper.”
“What’s in the pot?”
“It’s a surprise. Wait and see.”
“What about this?”“That is a watermelon. It will be too big for the pot.”
“See if you can find some spinach. It is also green.”
“Please get some bread. No, it won’t go into the pot but on the table.”
Mama carried the pot to the table and started to dish up.“What’s in the pot?” asked Sam.
“Soup!” My favourite!
Long ago, animals had no legs.
Maguru had given legs only to people.
Maguru decided to give legs to every animal.
The animals wanted legs to walk and run.
It was hard for them to crawl.
When the day came, different animals crawled to Maguru's house.
Maguru gave legs to animals and birds.
Some animals danced, while others fell down.
They said, "We will never crawl again."
Millipede was the last animal on the line.
Maguru gave Millipede all the remaining legs.
Millipede said happily, “I will move faster than others.”
After Millipede, Snake came begging, “Please give me some legs.”
Snake said to Maguru, "I over-slept."
Maguru did not find any legs for Snake.
From that day, Snake still waits to get legs.
Sonu, Monu and Rina set out to play.They saw a kitten.
She was looking at a big rat."Oh look!" shouted Sonu.
Rina saw a tiny ant going towards the big rat.
Suddenly, a very big shadow fell upon them all.
A very big eagle came down to the wall.A tiny ant, a small kitten,a big rat and a very big eagle in the same long street!
What would the three clever children do now?
They clapped their little hands!The eagle spread its big wings and flew away.
Rina made the ant climb onto a leaf. She left the leaf on the wall.The ant saw a grain of sugar. She picked it up and ran home.
The big rat picked up a half-eaten pakoda and went back into the drain.The small kitten said 'miaaww' and started licking her paw.
Monu got her some milk in a cup.The three kids played with her.
The very big eagle sitting on the tree blinked and flew far away.
It was a bright moonlit night. All the animals in Mangu's farm were sleeping. Except Tinku!
“I am not sleepy, Ma,” murmured Tinku. But Ma did not hear him. She was fast asleep. He turned left, and he turned right. He lay on his tummy, and rolled on his back. But he could not sleep!
So he set off into the night to see what he could find. Up in the sky, Tinku saw the moon, white and round, smiling down at him. He felt very happy.‘Night is beautiful,’ thought Tinku.
Far away on the top of a tree, there were some tiny lights. One spot of light flew down! “I’m a firefly,” said the spot of light. “I glow in the dark!”“Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku.“Yes, I will!” said the firefly.
Something flew by and hung upside down on a tree. “What is your name, bird?” asked Tinku.“I am not a bird, I am a bat. I can see during the night!” said the bat.“Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku.“Yes, I will!” said the bat.
A few leaves moved in the bushes. Someone was hiding! “Who are you?” asked Tinku.“I am a fox,” said the fox. “I go strolling out at night.”“Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku.“Yes, I will!” said the fox.
Two shiny eyes looked at him from a tree. “Who are you?” asked Tinku.“I’m an owl,” said the owl. “I hunt for food during the night.”“Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku.“Yes, I will!” said the owl.
“CHIRRRRRP! CHIRRRRRP!”“Who is here?” Tinku asked.“I’m a cricket,” said the cricket. “I chirp when it is dark.”“Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku.“Yes, I will!” said the cricket.
Tinku and his friends jumped and tossed and rolled until Tinku yawned. “I am sleepy. I have to go home now,” said Tinku. He was happy that he had many new friends. Snuggling close to Ma, he said, “Night is not a lonely place, Ma. Night is full of wonderful beings.”“Yes!” replied Ma. “Your new friends are nocturnal, just like wild dogs.”
“Nocturnal animals eat, play and work at night. They rest during the day. You must sleep now. Sleep will give you energy to play with your day-time friends tomorrow. Good night, little one!” she said, hugging him tight.
The bright round moon shone all night long, spreading her calm light all around. And Tinku slept all through the night!

There lived a girl called Kalabushe. She talked a lot.
One day, Kalabushe’s aunt fell ill.
That evening, Kalabushe took food to her sick aunt.
Kalabushe met a hyena who had changed into a person.
Kalabushe told him, “I am carrying meat, eggs and milk.”
The hyena licked his lips as he thought about meat.
The hyena ran ahead of Kalabushe to her aunt’s house.
He swallowed Kalabushe’s aunt. He covered himself with her blanket.
Kalabushe arrived and called out, “Aunt, where are you?”
Kalabushe saw someone covered with a big blanket.
Kalabushe asked, “Aunt, why are your ears so big today?”
“Aunt, why are your eyes so big?”
“Aunt, why is your mouth big?” The hyena swallowed her!
Kalabushe kept asking questions while inside the hyena’s stomach.
He became tired of Kalabushe’s questions. He spat her out.
Kalabushe and her aunt were rescued by the villagers.
Once upon a time, there lived a happy family.
The children never fought with each other. They helped their parents at home and in the fields.
But they were not allowed to go near a fire.
They had to do all their work during the night. Because they were made of wax!
But one of the boys longed to go out in the sunlight.
One day the longing was too strong. His brother and sister warned him.
But it was too late! He melted in the hot sun.
The wax children cried to see their brother melting away.
But they made a plan. They shaped the lump of melted wax into a bird.
They took their bird brother up to a high mountain.
And as the sun rose, he flew away, singing in the morning light.
Why is the baby crying?
I think she is hungry.
Why is the boy sad?
I think he is missing his father.
Why is the girl happy?
She has a new dress.
Why is the old man laughing?
He read a good joke.
Why is the lady smiling?
Her children are reading quietly.
What is this lady feeling?I think she is feeling shy.
Heeeee! There is a beautiful cow at home.
It has only one horn,  and no tail.
It is fat,  with a big stomach.
It is a powerful cow.
The shepherd loves this cow the most.
When the other cattle graze,  this one eats alone.
This cow is a fighter. Other cows leave it alone.
If you met such a cow,  what would you do?
One day, Mr Sloth came to visit. He said: I’m sleepy! I need a good branch for a bed! Yawn! Yawn! Yawn!
I’m quite good at climbing. I know how to swing.But sleeping’s my favourite, favourite thing!
This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here. And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?
Oh no, Mr Sloth! A giraffe’s eating there!He might think you’re lunch and start nibbling your hair!
This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here. And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?
Oh no, Mr Sloth! There’s a beehive right there! You’ll never get sleep with those bees everywhere!
This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here. And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?
Oh no, Mr Sloth, that’s a snake over there! Not a branch! Poor old snake. You gave him quite a scare. Sssssss! sssSSSs! SSss! Ssss!
This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here. And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?
Oh no, Mr Sloth!There’s a bird squawking there! You’ll never get sleep with that noise in the air!Haw-haw! Haw-Haw! Haw-haw!
Try climb one more branch, Mr Sloth! they all said. And that branch was just the right one for his bed.
The bird and the snake, the giraffe and each bee. Were happy to have Mr Sloth in their tree.
Where is my cat?
Is it under the bed?
Is it on top of the cupboard?
Is it behind the couch?
Is it next to the bin?
Is it inside the basket?
Is it outside the house?
Here it is!

He used to look after the cows with her.
One day the soldiers came.
They took the cows away.
Tingi and his grandmother ran away.
They hid in the bush until night.
Then the soldiers came back.
Grandmother hid Tingi under the leaves.
One of the soldiers put his foot right on him,  but he kept quiet.
When it was safe,  Tingi and his grandmother came out.
They crept home very quietly.

Little Ant loved to read. Little Ant was often teased. “Ants don’t read. Ants must feed. Ants collect the food they need.”
Little Ant would read all day, he’d read and read the day away.
The other ants took what they found to store for winter underground.
His mum and dad got really mad, and Little Ant felt really bad.
In autumn when the leaves fall down.
The ants must keep food underground.
The Queen wants food to fill the store, so all the ants must work some more.
Little Ant begins to shout about a place he read about. “A restaurant is what we need, a place where people go to feed. It says so in the books I read.”
The ants go marching one by one. They march into the setting sun.
And Little Ant said “Hey, there’s one!”
The ants go marching one by one, carrying a burger, carrying a bun.
When they return the Queen is glad. The stores are full. They cheer like mad.
Ant gets hugs from mum and dad.
His baby sister takes his hand “Now I think I understand.” “The way you love to read a book … Makes me want to take alook.”
Let me tell you my story. I start as a small spark.
I spread when the wind carries me.
We are good friends,  you and I.
I cook your food.
I light your night.
I have many tricks.
I am part of your family.
But be careful when you invite me to your home. I don't like to be left alone.
Come back, cat! Play with me.
Sit in your basket. Stay right here!
Come back, cat! That’s way too high.
Come back, cat! Don’t go outside.
Come back, cat! That’s not yours.
Come back, cat. What have you got?
Come back, cat.  That’s not your friend!
Hello, cat! Are you back?
Stay in your basket. It’s nap time now.
Cat?
Long, long ago there was a king called Kayanja. He lived in a palace with his queen and their daughter, Princess Apenyo. Princess Apenyo was such a beautiful young woman that every man wanted to marry her. But king Kayanja demanded a very high bride price for the princess.
Near king Kayanja's palace lived a chief called Aludah the Great. He was called "the Great" because everybody in the neighbourhood obeyed him, and he was very violent to anyone who disobeyed him! Chief Aludah's wife had recently died of malaria, and he wanted another wife.
So the fat old chief went to king Kayanja to offer bride wealth for the young princess. While the two men were discussing the price, the maid Kakembo overheard their conversation. Maid Kakembo was very close to princess Apenyo.
Chief Aludah agreed to give half of his wealth to king Kayanja, including a needle, which was also part of the bride price. Preparations were made in secret for the wedding between chief Aludah and princess Apenyo. The king knew that his daughter would not be happy with this decision.
One week before the royal wedding day, maid Kakembo approached Apenyo. "My dear Princess,  your father has organised your wedding with chief Aludah, and it will take place in one week."
Princess Apenyo was shocked and at first didn't know what to do. Then she thought, "I will never marry chief Aludah, that fat old man. Never! I must hurry to Trevor and see what he can do before it's too late." Trevor was princess Apenyo's boyfriend.
That night Apenyo crept out of the palace. If her father discovered where she was going he would be very angry. She ran through the thick, dark forest over rocks and shrubs. When finally she arrived at Trevor's house she was tired and thirsty.
"My love, why have you run all this long distance alone and at such a time of night?" asked Trevor. He fetched water for her and allowed her to rest. Trevor could not settle down while he waited for Apenyo to talk.
"My dear princess, what is the problem?" asked Trevor. Apenyo breathed heavily and said sadly, "My father wants to marry me off to chief Aludah the Great. But I can't marry that horrible man. Trevor, I want to marry you even if you are poor. I am ready to suffer. I love you."
"But princess, I have nothing to pay as your bride price, you know I'm a poor boy," cried Trevor. Apenyo replied, "I know, but it's only you I can get married to." She thought for a while and said, "Let's go to Kategga the boatman and ask him to take us across the river. That way we can escape and my father will never find us."
Back at the palace, king Kayanja had discovered princess Apenyo's disappearance. He ordered his subjects to search for her everywhere. The king's guards, soldiers, and everyone else searched, but they couldn't find the princess. They went back to the king and told him that Apenyo was nowhere to be seen. "Then go back and search again," King Kayanja ordered. He was very annoyed.
As Princess Apenyo and Trevor hurried to the riverbank, dark clouds began gathering in the sky. A heavy storm was coming.
Kategga the boatman was mooring his boat when the young couple approached him. Trevor asked Kategga to row them across the river. Kategga refused to accept, explaining that a heavy storm was fast approaching, and it would be too dangerous.
Trevor insisted and explained to Kategga why they must cross. He then put his hand deep in his pocket and took out a cowrie shell to give to Kategga. When Kategga heard their story and saw the beautiful shell, he felt sorry for them. He agreed to row them across the river in spite of the weather.
When King Kayanja and chief Aludah reached the bank, they saw the three people in the boat. They realised that the young lovers had escaped. Heavy winds rocked the boat and Kategga could no longer control it. King Kayanja shouted, "Apenyo, please come back! I forgive you. I will never punish you or Trevor."
But, it was too late. The boat tipped over and the three people were thrown into the wild water. They all drowned. After that day, everyone in king Kayanja's kingdom could marry anyone they wanted, rich or poor.

My name is Duma and I am ten years old.I live with my sister Zinhle who is thirteen years old.We live with Mama, Baba, our little brother Wandile, and our dog Bhubesi.
Since this coronavirus came, our lives have changed. It is such a small virus but it can make us very sick. Any person can get very sick from this coronavirus.
I am sad because I cannot play with my friends. Wandile is sad that he cannot hug his friends. Zinhle is also sad that she can't share her lip gloss with her friends.
Mama is a cleaner at the hospital in town. Baba sells fruits and vegetables in town.Every morning they leave for work and Zinhle looks after us.
Our neighbour, Gogo, is very old and has a heart problem. No one is allowed near her these days. The coronavirus is very dangerous for older people.We don't want to make her sick.
After work, Mama goes to check on Gogo and brings her fresh fruits. Mama leaves the fruits at the door because she can't go into the house.
Every morning, Zinhle goes to collect water from the nearby taps. Some people are wearing masks, some are not. Zinhle made a mask using her doek. She washes her hands at home. Mama puts hand sanitizer on our hands.
Every night, Mama reminds us: "Wear a fresh mask every day. Wash your hands with soap for 20 seconds when you arrive anywhere. Cover your mouth and nose if you cough or sneeze.""Yes, Mama!" we say.
1. Wash your hands with water.2. Use soap to wash your hands.3. Wash for 20 seconds or slowly count from 1 to 20.4. Rinse your hands with water.5. Dry your hands with clean towel or tissue.6. Now your hands are clean!
Once upon a time Jackal was walking around the bush. He was very hungry. He saw Crow flying above the trees with a big piece of cheese in his mouth.
"Hmmm that cheese looks delicious! I must find a way to get it," thought Jackal. "Oh, I have a plan!" said Jackal to himself while wiping his mouth quickly. He did not want Crow to notice that he was hungry.
Crow had been flying the whole morning. He was tired. He decided to sit on a branch of a tree. Jackal sat down under the tree where Crow was sitting.
Jackal called with a huge smile, "Hello Crow! You're looking very good today. Your feathers look glossy and healthy. You must be taking very good care of yourself."
Crow was very flattered to hear this. Crow always thought he was the strongest and most beautiful of all the other birds.
"I hear you also have the most beautiful singing voice of all the other birds. Won't you sing a song for me this morning?"
Crow was so flattered that he stretched his wings and prepared to sing for the jackal. He pushed his chest out and let out a loud pitched sound.
As Crow started singing the cheese fell to the ground, right in front of Jackal. Crow stopped and looked down. Jackal grabbed the piece of cheese and ran into the bush. Crow was left angry and hungry.

Everyone knows that the elephant has a very long nose.
But a long time ago, the elephant's nose was short and fat. Like a shoe in the middle of its face.
One day a baby elephant was born. She was curious about everything. She had a question for every animal.
She was curious about Giraffe. "Why do you have a long neck?" she asked.
She was curious about Rhino. "Why does your horn have a sharp point?"
She was curious about Hippo. "Why do you have red eyes?" she asked.
And she was VERY curious about Crocodile. "What does Crocodile eat for dinner?" she asked.
"Never ask a question like that!" said her mother. Then she walked off, frowning.
Quickly Crow flew down to Baby Elephant. "Follow me to the river. There you will see what Crocodile eats for dinner," squawked Crow.
So the baby elephant followed Crow down to the river.
She pushed through the reeds and stood on the bank. She looked into the water. Where was Crocodile?
"Hello," said a stone near the river bank. "Hello," said Baby Elephant. "Can you tell me what Crocodile eats for dinner?" she asked.
"Bend down and I will tell you," said the stone. "Lower, lower," said the stone. So Baby Elephant bent down lower, and lower.
Then suddenly, "Snap!" Baby Elephant's nose was caught in Crocodile's jaws. "Crocodile will eat you for dinner!" squawked Crow, and flew away.
Baby Elephant sat back on her strong legs and pulled. She pulled, and pulled. But Crocodile did not let go of her nose.
Baby Elephant's nose stretched, and stretched, and stretched. Then, "Thud!" she fell on her back.
Crocodile sunk back into the water. He was cross about losing his dinner.
Baby Elephant looked at her nose. It was stretched very long. She could not see where it ended!
Her nose was so long she could pick fruit from high branches.
Her nose was so long she could shower her back with water. From that day, all elephants had long and useful trunks.

One day,  Rabbit was walking by the riverside.
Hippo was there too,  going for a stroll and eating some nice green grass.
Hippo didn't see that Rabbit was there and she accidentally stepped on Rabbit's foot. Rabbit started screaming at Hippo,  "You Hippo! Can't you see that you're stepping on my foot?"
Hippo apologised to Rabbit,  "I'm so sorry. I didn't see you. Please forgive me!" But Rabbit wouldn't listen and he shouted at Hippo,  "You did that on purpose! Someday,  you'll see! You're going to pay!"
Rabbit went to find Fire and said,  "Go,  burn Hippo when she comes out of the water to eat grass. She stepped on me!"  Fire answered,  "No problem,  Rabbit,  my friend. I'll do just what you ask."
Later,  Hippo was eating grass far from the river when,  "Whoosh!" Fire burst into flame. The flames began to burn Hippo's hair.
Hippo started to cry and ran for the water. All her hair was burned off by the fire. Hippo kept crying,  "My hair has burned in the fire! My hair is all gone! My beautiful hair!"
Rabbit was happy that Hippo's hair was burned. And to this day,  for fear of fire,  the hippo never goes far from the water.

When Rohan woke up, he began to play with Jimmy, his dog.“There’s something you should do first!” said Riya, his big sister. “BRUSH YOUR TEETH!”WOOF!
“I don’t want to brush my teeth! Jimmy doesn’t brush his teeth!”“Animals take care of their teeth too, but in other ways! We must brush our teeth to keep germs away!”“Germs?”“Germs are very tiny creatures that you cannot see. If you don’t brush properly, they stay in your mouth and hurt you!”“Ouch!”“YES! That’s why we must take good care of our teeth by brushing twice a day - morning and night!”“But brushing is no fun!”“I’ll tell you a secret, Rohan! Psst…”  Rohan smiled.
Mummy called out, “It’s breakfast time!” “There’s something we should do first!” said Riya. “WASH OUR HANDS!”WOOF!
“But Jimmy never washes his hands!”Riya laughed, “He doesn’t use his hands or paws to eat like we do! We must wash our hands with soap to get rid of germs.”“Are germs on our hands too?”“Germs are EVERYWHERE!”WOOF!“Aaaah-chhhooo!” Riya covered her mouth with her hands as she sneezed.“Don't do that! My teacher says that we should sneeze into our sleeve, not our hands!" said Rohan.“Why?”“Because when we sneeze into our hands, germs stick to them. If we don’t wash our hands, we spread germs and make others sick!”
“Here comes Germy!” Riya shouted, chasing Rohan and waving herdirty hands.  “EEEEEEEK!”WOOF!
Later Riya showed Rohan the proper way to wash hands. “Wet your hands and turn off the tap. Then rub in some soap on the palms, the back of the hands and between the fingers. Scrub hands for twenty seconds! Now, it’s time to rinse off and dry!”“But that’s a long time!”“Remember my secret?”Rohan smiled.
When they came back home after playing, Riya nudged Rohan, “There’s something we should do first!”Mummy teased, “Play some more?”“TAKE A BATH!”“Mummy, don’t you know that germs are everywhere? We can’t see them, but they stick to our skin and clothes!”“That’s why we must bathe every day…” “…to get rid of them!”
"Start by getting yourself wet,” said Mummy. “Then apply soap all over!” Riya and Rohan giggled as Mummy’s ticklish fingers soaped them up.“Then it’s time to rinse off!”“And dry with a clean towel!”“SUPERCLEAN!”WOOF! “It’s Jimmy’s turn next!”
“Do you want to listen to a story?” asked Papa.
“There’s something we should do first!” reminded Riya. “Tidy UP!”Rohan yawned. “Do we have to?”“Remember you couldn’t find your ball the other day? Putting things away in the proper place makes it easy to find them later!”“And keeps our house neat!” “You both are so smart!” said Papa proudly. “Bedtime!”“Papa! There’s something we should do first!” said Riya, pulling Rohan along.“Make the germs disappear with our magic secret!”Rohan nodded.
A few minutes later, Mummy and Papa heard a familiar tune. “So that’s your secret!” said Papa. “Humming a song to make brushing fun!”“And while washing our hands too!”“That’s a great idea!” said Mummy.WOOF!Rohan and Riya enjoy taking care of themselves. Do you? They make up a game with the germs and guess who wins?
Germs say, yucky, mucky and dirty is FUN!I say, I brush and wash and I know I have won!Germs say, never bathe, it’s a waste of time!I say, smelling nice with soap is so fine.Naughty germ says don’t pick up your things, The house looks better that way.I say, I tidy up because I like my thingsThat is a good way to end my day!And I feel better in every wayI feel better in every way! I FEEL BETTER IN EVERY WAY!!!!!Now make up your secret song and hum it when you have to do boring things!

Once upon a time the rabbit was a great friend of the monkey.
One day the rabbit said,  "Let's go for a walk and look for something to eat." The monkey agreed,  but it was a trap for him!
They went to a field of maize and started to eat it.
But the clever rabbit had spoken to the owners of the farm,  to catch the monkey and show him he was foolish.
The clever rabbit started shouting,  "Robbers! Robbers! Your maize is all gone!" And he jumped up and ran away.
Suddenly the owners appeared and found the monkey trying to run away. But he has a long tail and it was stopping him.
The owners followed him,  shouting,  "Stop! Stop! We saw you,  you are the monkey."
But they caught him and started beating him.
He couldn't stand the pain so he said,  "I was with my friend Rabbit. He is the one who invited me."
But the owners cut his tail off and told him,  "Go and tell your friend that we cut off your tail!"
Then they went to the rabbit's house and cooked the monkey's tail to eat. The rabbit invited the monkey for lunch.
At the end of the meal the rabbit asked the monkey if he knew what he had eaten. The foolish monkey answered,  "No I don't!"
The rabbit told him that he had eaten his own tail and then ran away. And from then on they became enemies!
I like my teacher very much.
She is beautiful. She is a good teacher. She is kind and patient.
She braided her hair pretty nice.
She placed colorful beads in her hair.
The beads are green, white, red, and yellow.
Mom, could you please braid my hair just like my teacher's?
When I grow older, I will also place colorful beads on my hair.
I will grow up to be just like my teacher!
Mama K has been harvesting cabbages all week. Doobie,  Maya and Duksie help Mama K in her vegetable garden on Saturday mornings. Today the children are going to help with counting and packing the cabbages. Then Baba K will take boxes of cabbages to sell at the market.
The taxi drops off the children at the garden gate. They can see the huge heap of cabbages piled up near Baba K's old truck. "Yo! What a lot of cabbages!" says Maya pointing. "There must be a thousand cabbages there!" laughs Duksie. "No way! Two hundred at the most!" disagrees Doobie.
Mama K is waiting at the gate. "Hello everyone,  I'm happy to see you!" she greets the children. "Now let's get to work. You'll need to count the cabbages and put them into boxes,  12 cabbages in each box. I have 20 boxes. Two of you can each pack 7 boxes and one of you can pack 6 boxes."
The children stand around the pile of cabbages. They talk about different ways to count the cabbages. "I think I will count mine in 2s," Maya says. "I like counting in 4s," says Duksie,  "it's quicker."  "I'm going to count in 3s,  just to be different!" pipes up Doobie.
Soon the children have filled 20 boxes. "Good work!" exclaims Mama K. "Look,  there are some cabbages left over. My pigs love cabbages so let's share these with them," she suggests. "How many cabbages did you pack into boxes? How many cabbages were left over?" she asks the children.
The next job is to write the price on each box and then help Baba K load the boxes on his truck. They must put half the boxes on one side of the truck and half on the other side,  to balance the load.
"We're almost done!" says Baba K. "Let's see,  how many more boxes we must still put on each side to balance the load?"
Soon all 20 boxes are loaded onto the truck. Baba K warms up the engine and drives off to market. "If I can sell all the boxes," he thinks to himself,  "I'll have enough money to fix the pig pen and get a surprise for the children!"
Back at the farm,  Mama K and the children water plants and rake leaves. By twelve o'clock they are all tired. Mama K tells them,  "It's time for your treat. Can you guess what it I have for you today?"
She goes inside to fetch their surprise. The children wait patiently for her to return while they guess what she might bring them. When she comes down the path her apron pockets are bulging!
"Let's see if you guessed right! What's in store for you today?" Mama K tips out her apron pockets and a pile of yellow apples falls onto the table. "See,  I was right!" Duksie squeals. Mama K tells the children,  "Now remember the rule. Share fair! No one to get more or less than the other!"
First the children count the apples in 2s. The count: 2,  4,  6,  8,  10,  12,  14,  16,  and 1 apple left over, Altogether there are 17 apples.
Next,  they share out the apples equally. There are 2 apples left over. The children then put their apples in their bags to take home. How many does each child get?
"Let's cut the 2 apples to share between us," suggests Duksie. "How many parts of the apple will we each get?" asks Maya. "I know the answer!" smiles Doobie.
Just then Baba K arrives home from market. The truck is empty and Baba K is smiling. "I sold all the cabbages. Now I can fix the pig pen and buy you that soccer ball you wanted.  "Yay!" shout the children."
Umhlangano waqhubeka naxasibeni kubonakala zingekho iindlovu.“Sizoqhuba nevoti noba zingekho iindlovu. Sizobeka inkosi namhlanje,” watsho uSikhova.
Izilwanyana zavotela ukuba inkosi kuzoba nguMpovani.UMpovani wavumela phezulu nakubeni heyi zothwala omxinzi.“Luxanduva olufaka umsebenzi omninzi,” waacinga.
Iindaba zoba uMpovani wenyulwe uba abeyinkosi zahamba ngokutshetsha.Zifikile ezindlebeni zenkosana yeendlovu.Yamcunukisa kakhulu inkosana.
Inkosana yeendlovu yaya kufuna ukudla ehlathini.Ngokuziqqaja, ngamakhulu amatshamba yayizazi uba inamandla futhi ingenandaba kwanampovani.Enoba heyihamba kumgade wazo na kakade, yona heyidlisela.
Ngamandla esiyinawo, inkosana isiphule isiphunzi kwaphuma iimpovani ezininzi!INkosi uMpovani uchola ithuba angene kuwo umboko.“Kumele uhloniphe wonke umntu,” watsho uMpovani eyiluma inkosana yeendlovu.
Inkosana yeendlovu yagxwala yacela utshweli ngelithi izokwenza kwasani exelwa nguMpovani mayingayibulali.Indlovu yagoduka itshwencile ingaphathanga kudla, suka zee mekenxe ezinye iindlovu zixakiwe uba kwenzekeni.Yachaza konke okuyehleleyo kunye nezethembiso azenze kuMpovani.
Ezinye iindlovu zagcobela ukuthola inkosana yazo iphila.Zangabi sabi nandaba nokulawula kwabo ke nguMpovani.Kanjalo ulawulo lucholwa zimbovani noba zincane.
In a tiny village of  Lumela, lives a little boy called Chipego.  Chipego lives with his father, mother and his  little sister Mutinta.  There is one more special member of the family, Pendo the cow. Chipego helps his father to look after Pendo in exchange for pocket money that he uses to buy books. Meet Chipego. He is 10 years old and in Grade 5 at the village school. Chipego always comes top of his class. "What's his secret?" his schoolmates ask themselves."He's excellent in reading and writing. How does he do it?" they wonder. Chipego tells them it is because he reads lots of books. While they waste their time doing nothing, he spends all his free time reading.
Chipego sometimes earns K80.00 a week in pocket money. He spends most of the pocket money on books at the second-hand book shop in his village.So how does Chipego earn enough pocket money for these books? Read on to find out.
Meet Pendo, the family's milking cow. She produces over 20 litres of milk per day. Chipego's father sells the milk.A cow needs food and water, and time to graze in the field. So each day after school, Chipego helps with this work. Chipego's father gives him pocket money for the work he does. And it is this money that Chipego saves to buy books each week.
First, Chipego gives Pendo a bunch of carrots. He gives her exactly eight carrots a day. Each day he picks the carrots from his father's vegetable garden, enough for a day at a time.You can work it out. You will find that Pendo eats nearly 60 carrots a week. Can you tell exactly how many?
After that, Chipego takes Pendo to graze in the fields. His father warned him to watch the time and give Pendo not  more than three quarters of an hour to graze.Pendo usually starts grazing at about14:15 hrs, so that Chipego can take her back to the milking shed at 15 hours. In winter when it gets dark earlier, Chipego may start grazing earlier, around 13:30 hrs.
Next Chipego gives Pendo water. Without water Pendo won't produce milk, no matter how much Chipego feeds her. Chipego fetches buckets of water from the village pump because there isn't one nearby.Pendo's trough holds about 30 litres of water. Chipego's bucket only holds 5 litres. So to fill the trough Chipego has to make many trips. Can you work out how many trips he has to make?
Then, Chipego takes Pendo to his father to get her daily 12 kg bag of grain. Chipego calculates that's almost 90 kg a week.Each bag costs K39.00. Chipego works out the cost of grain for each week. First he works out the cost of 7 bags at K40.00, which makes K280.00 Then he subtracts K7.00 to get K273.00 "That's over K1 000 a month!" Chipego estimates. Is he correct?
Chipego's father milks Pendo twice a day. She produces about 24 litres of milk a day, so about 12 litres for each milking.Sometimes Chipego helps with the milking but it is not as easy as it looks. "One day," he thinks to himself, "I will have my own cows and I will have to do all the milking myself."
His father pours the milk from the big bucket into smaller two litre cans or one litre bottles. He then sells the milk for K8.00 a litre.Once a week Chipego's father donates 25 litres of milk to Bulela School feeding scheme. Each child gets a quarter litre of this milk. That means that 100 children get milk on this day.
For each litre of milk sold, his father gives Chipego 50 ngwee. That doesn't sound like a lot, but if his father sells 24 litres a day, it adds up to quite a bit. Can you tell how much?Chipego saves his money until Saturday when he makes a trip to the book shop. Each book costs less than k10.00, so in a good week, he can buy quite a few.
Chipego also loves to drink Pendo's milk. His father says that milk helps to build strong bones and teeth and makes a person fit and healthy.So by drinking milk and eating lots of vegetables from his father's garden, Chipego is strong and healthy. He seldom gets sick and never goes hungry. His mother loves making mabisi using Pendo's milk too. His young sister enjoys adding the milk to her chibwantu! Hmmm! Yummy!
Chipego never forgets to thank Pendo at the end of each day. He rewards her with extra carrots or spinach leaves that he finds lying around the garden."Thank you Pendo, you are my best friend! It is thanks to you that I am strong, healthy and clever. If not for you I would never be able to buy all the books that help me be top of my class." One day I will be a veterinary  doctor because of you!Pendo is very lucky because Mutinta, Chipego's mother and Father also rewards her! What an amazing cow!
This is Jaaka the fisherman from Naminya.
He fishes on the river Nile.
He has a boat,  fishing net and a hook.
He always wakes up very early in the morning to catch the Nile perch.
At around 10am,  he's selling his catch in Jinja central market.
Jaaka what happened? Was it a loss? He's so sad.
"Today the situation is bad. The Nile breeze did not permit me to fish. And one perch swam away with my hook."
"But I have hope that tomorrow will be good,  because I've bought a new hook."

Nestled in the Kingdom of the Zulu is a magnificent place called the Valley.
A little girl called Jabulile lives here. Jabulile was always a happy child. She was also curious, and full of questions about life.Everything fascinated her.
Jabulile’s father was a mielie farmer.Her mother was a teacher. They taught her to dream big dreams. Jabulile’s biggest dream was to help people.
One awful day, the clouds began to gather over the Valley. Everything grew dark and grey. An ugly storm swept over the land.
Great gusts of wind blew the roofs off the huts. All the animals lost their homes. It was a very sad day.
The village folk cried, “What shall we do now?”“All the crops are ruined!” cried the farmers. “Our homes are gone!” said the elders. All hope seemed lost. But Jabulile remembered something her wise father once told her.
Jabulile started speaking to the villagers.“The storm only hurts us,” she said, “because of the way we choose to see it. If you look up, the sun is shining again. It is a new day.“After every storm, there must be a rainbow!” she shouted excitedly.
The villagers saw the rainbow and they began to smile. It stood as a promise that the storm was over.
The villagers rebuilt their homes. Farmers planted new crops. The grass grew greener than ever before.
Once again there was hope and happiness in the Valley.
A long time ago,  the king of the bush was Mr Lion.
He sent his animals to stop the noise coming from a small lake in the bush. But they did not succeed!
An elephant volunteered to stop it. The elephant was sent out as a guard.
At midnight the noise began and the elephant started killing the frogs. He did the same thing the next day.
After a couple of weeks,  King Lion was happy because the elephant had stopped the noise.
But about a month later,  they saw a lot of insects on their farm.
King Lion asked the elephant to call the frogs to come and eat the insects.
The elephant was very nervous because he had killed all of them. He said,  "Sorry,  sorry,  I k- k- k- killed them!"
Then King Lion said: Elephant,  I asked you to stop the noise,  not to kill the frogs. And the elephant was put in prison for many years!
And the king told all the animals to always do exactly what he said.
One day a very clever baby was born in Gungululu in the Eastern Cape. Her name was Sindiwe Magona. She was the oldest of eight children.
At night, her grandmother told magical stories about ogres and giants, animals of the forests, great beasts, and little creatures of the veld. It was Sindiwe’s favourite time.
Sindiwe loved school and she dreamed about being a teacher.
When Sindiwe became a teenager, her family organised a feast to celebrate. She was given special things to wear and a wise old man sang a praise song to her. (Blessings, long life! May your ancestors guard you!)
Sindiwe trained to be a teacher. She was very excited to teach at her first school. But there weren’t enough schools for black children and they had no desks or books to write in. This made Sindiwe feel scared. How could she be a good teacher when the children had nowhere to sit?
She left the school to work as a cleaner.She worked in four different houses. Sometimes the people there treated her badly and Sindiwe became very unhappy.
All this time Sindiwe studied. Her hard work paid off! She won a scholarship to study at a university in New York. She and her three small children packed their bags and flew across the sea to the United States of America.
In New York, Sindiwe studied to become a social worker. She wanted to help families make their lives better.
When she finished studying, the United Nations gave Sindiwe a job. Most of the countries in the world meet at the United Nations to talk about their problems.
Sindiwe told the world about South Africa, and how hard it was for black people living there. The people at the United Nations loved to listen to Sindiwe’s stories. They wanted to learn more and more about South Africans. Perhaps, together, they could help to change things in South Africa.
She worked at the United Nations for twenty years while her children grew into adults. But Sindiwe missed the country where she was born. She wanted to tell her stories to the people at home.So she packed her luggage, got on a plane and flew back over the sea to Cape Town.
Sindiwe’s love for books and stories have helped her write piles and piles of books. And children and grown-ups love to read her stories. Many people call her Nomabali because she’s always writing, telling and reading stories.
Every day when eight-year-old Sisanda gets home from school,  she changes out of her uniform,  eats her lunch and plays a game of umlabalaba with her grandfather. They have so much fun flying their "cows" around the board that she doesn't want to stop. But then he reminds her that she wants to become a bank manager one day when she grows up.
For her last birthday,  Sisanda had a special treat – her parents got permission for her to have a party at the game reserve. The giraffes at the reserve were curious about this group of people. They stretched out their long necks for the best view of the party and they even seemed to want some of the birthday cake! Sisanda loved the giraffes. All animals were special to her,  but it was the quiet and gentle giraffes that stole her heart. She could spend all day watching them.
"Oh no!" said Sisanda starting to cry. "I wish there was something I could do. The baby giraffe must be crying just like me." Sisanda cried and cried. Her mother tried to comfort her. She even read Sisanda an extra story at bedtime to help her forget how sorry she felt for that baby giraffe. Eventually,  Sisanda drifted off to sleep to the sound of her mama's voice.
They found the baby giraffe standing alone. His willowy neck drooped and his big brown eyes looked dull. Sisanda stood as close to him as she could. She opened her small bag and took out a book. Then,  to her parents' surprise,  she began to read to the baby giraffe. He turned his head towards her voice and listened as if he could understand every word. At first,  Sisanda's parents thought reading to a giraffe was a strange thing to do,  but they changed their minds when they saw how peaceful he looked − his gentle eyes looking at Sisanda.
On the day of the outing,  forty Grade 3 children waited eagerly for the reserve gates to open. Then Sisanda proudly led everyone to Thokozani. Some of the children looked at the tall giraffe in amazement. Others giggled nervously. Their teacher,  Miss Khanyile,  just smiled.
One day a rat saw a Biiigggg Bun... "Ah, ha... what a lovely feast. Let me take this to my hollow," she said.
She pushed the bun from the back. AAAAeeeeee!!!huh!!!It did not move.
The Rat pushed the bun from forward. Did it move? Oh, not at all!
The Rat pushed the bun from right. Oh no, still the same.
The rat ran and pushed the bun from the left. Did it dare to move? no, not at all!!
"Isn't this crazy" the rat thought. "Let me tie a thread and then move, may be" jumped the rat.
The rat came out with a thread, within no time.  She tied the bun with a long piece of thread and,...now started to pull!
"Ah, i can't" cried the tired rat. But, she has an idea!"Umm, But let me just eat it here," she said and bit a piece of bun. "Yummm, so tasty", she said. She ate two pieces now. And, ate a bit more. And, few more too. It ate so much that the size of the bun is now small!!
The rat started pushing the bun again. The eatery just slipped to the hollow. "Ah! Finally, it is in"The rat just couldn't stop grinning. But, Oh, ho!! Now, the rat's stomach is full!
The rat tried to get into the hollow. But, she just can't!!
The rat sits outside the hollow. Her stomach is so full that, she just cannot enter the hollow!! "Huh, i ate too much," the rat cried.

"God is our strong refuge; he is truly our helper in times of trouble."Psalm 46:1
Long ago, there was a man who had a very serious wound on his leg. He could not stand or walk. This man lived in a village with his wife and their children.
The couple had three sons and one daughter. The daughter's name was Nangila. Her duty was to take care of her father. The sons worked on the land and grazed animals.
Nangila was a beautiful girl. All the villagers liked and respected her. Her parents wanted a good husband for Nangila. They set a difficult task in order to find the right man.
Anyone who wanted to marry Nangila would have to get a herb from a lake near the village. This herb would heal her father's wound. But the lake was filled with dangerous spirits.
Some men tried to get the herb but returned without it. Some men did not return from the lake at all.
Nangila felt worried. Not even her brothers would go to the lake. One day, she decided to fetch the herb herself. Her mother said, "My daughter, if strong men have failed, how will you succeed?" But Nangila had made up her mind.
On the way to the lake, Nangila met an old woman carrying wood. She helped the woman to carry her firewood. The old woman was grateful. She said to Nangila, "I will tell you how to reach the spirit lake and what to do when you get there."
When she reached the shore of the lake, Nangila saw the spirit family drinking and dancing. She waited and watched. One by one, the spirits fell asleep.
Once the spirits were all sleeping, Nangila dived into the lake. She found the herb and put it in her bag. As she swam back to land, the waves were rising.
When Nangila reached the shore the spirits were awake. She was afraid, but she sang the song the old woman taught her: I, daughter of Wekesa, am from the lake. I came because men are too scared to come. My father needs this herb to heal his wound. That is why I am here, in the land where many are scared to reach, for you are the rulers.
Nangila's voice was so sweet that the spirits asked her to sing for them again and again. Her singing sent the spirits back to sleep. Then Nangila ran very fast until she got to her village.
Everyone was waiting for Nangila to return. After treating his wound with the herb her father was able to stand again. The entire village danced and praised Nangila.
It happened one year that the rain didn't fall. The trees dried up and died. The rivers disappeared and the water evaporated. People and animals were dying from hunger and thirst.
The chief animals met to talk about the situation. Lion said, "Let's call everyone together and discuss the idea of digging a well. We can drink from its waters."Elephant agreed and went off to spread the news to the other animals.
All the animals gathered to discuss the situation. Lion began, saying, "My brothers and sisters, this year the rain has not fallen. Everyone is dying from hunger and thirst. Let us dig a well so that we can all drink from it."
The animals all agreed and immediately grabbed hoes, shovels and picks. They started digging a well.
Hare had not come, but the other animals continued without him. They dug. And they dug. And they dug some more. And finally they hit water. When they struck water, Lion said, "Why did Hare not come to help? He will not drink from this water!"
Later Hare came and saw the well. He said, "Hello?" But he heard nothing. So he went in and splashed around in the water for a while.
The next day, when the animals came, they saw that their well was a big mess. The water was nothing but mud. They asked, "Who would do such a thing?" Someone said, "I bet it was Hare, because when we were digging the well he was nowhere to be found."
The animals decided to leave a guard at the well. They chose Baboon to keep an eye on things. Hare came to the well that night, and said, "Hello?" And Baboon replied, "Hello!" So Hare came over to Baboon, saying "Try this!" Hare gave Baboon some honey. And Baboon let him take some water. Just then, Hyena arrived and saw Hare drinking.
The next day, Hyena went and told all the animals that Hare had taken water from the well. They chose Turtle to guard the well. Turtle was on the job when Hare arrived at night, saying, "Hello?" He didn't hear a sound.He started talking to himself, "Lucky me! I've come to have a little drink."
When Turtle had arrived at the well, she had hidden herself among the rocks. She looked just like another rock. As soon as Hare started to go into the water, Turtle grabbed Hare by the leg. Hare said, "Oops, you didn't grab me. You've grabbed a stick!" But Turtle didn't say a word. She stayed there holding onto Hare until the sunrise.
When Lion arrived, he saw that Turtle had captured Hare. He called the rest of the animals to decide what to do with Hare. When all the animals were assembled, Lion asked them, "What shall we do with Hare?"Turtle said, "I want Elephant to grab him with her trunk and beat him on rocks." All the other animals agreed.
Hare quickly said, "O Great Lion, you know that hares don't die if you hit them on rocks. A hare will only die if he is thrown into ashes."So, Lion told Elephant to grab Hare. Elephant picked him up and started hitting him in a pile of ash from a fire.
After Hare was completely covered in ashes, Elephant threw him. As Hare landed he made a big cloud of dust! When the animals saw the dust they really laughed.
When the dust settled, the animals looked around and Hare was gone! And then they knew that Hare had tricked them again.
Odongo and Apiyo lived in the city with their father. They looked forward to the holidays. Not only because school was closed, but because they went to visit their grandmother. She lived in a fishing village near a large lake.
Odongo and Apiyo were excited because it was time to visit their grandmother again. They packed their bags and got ready for their long journey the next day. They could not sleep and talked about the holiday the whole night.
Early the next morning, they left for the village in their father's car. They drove past mountains, wild animals, and tea plantations. They counted cars and sang songs.
After a while, the children were tired and fell asleep.
Father woke up Odongo and Apiyo as they arrived in the village. They found Nyar-Kanyada, their grandmother, resting on a mat under a tree. In thier language, Nyar-Kanyada means "daughter of the people of Kanyada." She was a strong and beautiful woman.
Nyar-Kanyada welcomed them into the house. She danced around the room singing with joy. Her grandchildren were excited to give her the presents they brought from the city. "First open my gift," said Odongo. "No, my gift first!" said Apiyo.
After she opened the presents, Nyar-Kanyada blessed her grandchildren in a traditional way.
Then Odongo and Apiyo went outside. They chased butterflies and birds.
They climbed trees and splashed in the water of the lake.
When it was dark they returned to the house for dinner. Before they could finish eating, they were falling asleep!
The next day, the children's father drove back to the city leaving them with Nyar-Kanyada.
Odongo and Apiyo helped their grandmother with household chores. They fetched water and firewood. They collected eggs from the chickens and picked vegetables from the garden.
Nyar-Kanyada taught her grandchildren to make soft ugali to eat with stew. She showed them how to make coconut rice to eat with roast fish.
One morning, Odongo took his grandmother's cows to graze. They ran onto a neighbour's farm. The farmer was angry with Odongo. He threatened to keep the cows for eating his crops. After that day, the boy made sure that the cows did not get into trouble again.
On another day, the children went to the market place with Nyar-Kanyada. She had a stall selling vegetables, sugar and soap. Apiyo liked to tell customers the price of items. Odongo would pack the items that customers bought.
At the end of the day they drank chai tea together. They helped grandmother to count the money she earned.
But too soon the holidays were over. The children had to go back to the city. Nyar-Kanyada gave Odongo a cap and Apiyo a sweater. She packed food for their journey.
When their father came to fetch them,  they did not want to leave. The children begged Nyar-Kanyada to go with them to the city. She smiled and said, "I am too old for the city. I will be waiting for you to visit me again."
Odongo and Apiyo both hugged her tightly, and said goodbye.
When Odongo and Apiyo went back to school they told their friends about life in the village.   Some children felt that life in the city was good. Others felt that the village was better. But most of all, everyone agreed that Odongo and Apiyo had a wonderful grandmother!
An apple fell from a tree under which Rabbit was sleeping.
Rabbit heard a voice say, “Run Rabbit run!”
Rabbit told Chicken, “Something fell and I heard, ‘Run Rabbit run!'”
Chicken started running when she heard what Rabbit said.
They told Dog, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Dog started running with Rabbit and Chicken.
Dog told Horse, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Horse started to run with the others.
Donkey asked, “Why are you running?” Horse replied, “I don’t know.”
Donkey started running with them.
Donkey told Cow, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Cow was worried and started to run as well.
Cow told Cat, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Cat started running with the other animals.
They met a boy. “Don’t you know what happened?” he asked.
“It was me who said, ‘Run Rabbit run!’” laughed the boy.
Bobabini hebengabangani abakhulu hebehlukene kakhulu.UNonjana hekuthanda ukulala, ukudla engathembeki.Kanti yena uKatana helungile, enokubele futhi engumngani ongamthemba.Yeyonto eyadalukuba batshube kwelokuba bayolalisa kwaNonjana, khonukuze baxele ngohambo lwabo.
Wathi uNonjana, “Mna ndizophatha ukudla kwemini yokuqala.”“Mna ndophatha ukudla kwemini yesibini,” watsho uKatana evuma.Baabhala oko phantsi khonukuze bangaliballi.
“Kuzobamandi kusasa masimbona umngani wethu uNkukhu, kaade samtshubela,” watsho uNonjana ekhapha umnganakhe ejika ebuyela endlinakhe.“Ndiyabonga ngokundikhapha mngan’am,” kutsho uKatana.
Ekuseni baayiqala indlela.Endleleni hebejabule, becula amaculo bedantsa.Baafika emthini bachopha phantsi. “Chaka ndilambile,” watsho uKatana kuNonjana.
UNonjana waakhipha umxhafuxhafu kokudla.Wakhipha izikotile ezimbini waqala ukuchaka ukudla loo nyavunyavu ngokutshetsha.‘’Kukudla kwethu oku?” waabuza uKatana ecunuka ngenyani.Zeyimtshincile into yoba umnganakhe ephule izigqibo. Waaphutsha ke ngoku yilento.
“Ulindeni?” waabuza uNonjana eqalisa esidla.“Kutheni wathwala ukudla kwakho wedwa?”waacunuka watsho uKatana.UNonjana waqhubeka wadla. Esadla kanjalo, nangenxa yokuphanga namafutha ayegcwele isandla sakhe, satshibilika isikotile sawa phantsi.Ukudla konke kwachitheka kowo mhlaba bebehleli kuwo.
“Kulungile ke mnganam,” watsho uKatana.UKatana waakhipha amakhekhe amahle kweyakhe ingxiwa wadla.Ngoyonkxetsha, uNonjana hebheke ukudla kuka Katana ngamehlo arhalayo.Xa uKatana egqibile ukudla wapakisha. “Singaqhubeka nendlela?”
Ukususela ngoko ke beemka bedle imu kolo hambo lonke. Isisu sikaNonjana sasifundekela.Ngobo busuku, uKatana wazichakela ukudla kwakhe walala, egcobile kuba eziphathele ukudla okwaneleyo.UNonjana walala engadlanga.
Ngosuku olulandelayo, uKatana wadla intwana yokudla phambi koba bahambe. UNonjana herhala engakwazi nokuzigola emana ebheka ukudla kukaKatana.UKatana wabuye watshona engxiweni yakhe. “Naku ukudla,” watsho uKatana.“Yhoo, undixolele. Ndenze kabi,” watsho uNonjana.“Masidle,” watsho uKatana.Bachopha phantsi aba bangani badla.
Besotshuba baaqhubeka nohambo baabuye badlala futhi ngathi aange baxabane.Baafika kwamngani wabo liselihle iwatshi.“Nihambe kanjani bangani bam?” watsho uNkukhu.“Sihambe kahle kakhulu,” baaphendula batsho ngankxetsha bencumelene.
Kwaaba ngumgubho omkhulu wokuzalwa.Baacula! Badantsa! Badla!
In a country called Gabon,  a little village stood at the very edge of a forest. In the heart of this forest,  in the highest branches of an enormous tree,  lived a very special bird − the bird that made rain.
For as far back as the villagers could remember,  they had taken the time to keep this bird happy. They saved scraps of bread,  pieces of fruit and fresh coconut milk,  and every week or two a group of villagers took these delicacies into the forest. When they had laid them at the base of the tree,  one of them played a simple tune on the thumb piano.
After a while,  the bird flew down to the ground to eat and drink. When she had finished,  she began to sing the most beautiful song.   At the same time,  she raised her dark,  shiny blue wings,  and within minutes,  the rain began to fall.
This went on for many years. Because the rain fell regularly,  the crops grew abundantly and there was plenty of food in the village.   But gradually things began to change. Somehow,  the villagers were always busy and they began to neglect the rain bird. "It will rain anyway," they said. "It's time to stop spoiling that silly old bird!"
But the people were wrong. When they stopped looking after the bird,  the rain stopped falling. The crops began to dry up and die,  and the animals grew thin and weak. Still,  nobody in the village went into the forest to feed the bird that brought the rain. Now they were all too busy trying to find money to buy food in the neighbouring town.
One scorching day,  a young girl called Ketti decided to go into the forest after school. "At least it will be cool in there," she thought. She walked and walked,  and after some time,  she came to the tall tree in which the rain bird lived. Ketti stared up at the tree. Suddenly,  she remembered how her granny had taken her into the forest to feed the bird when she was still a tiny child. Ketti opened her school bag and pulled out a piece of bread left over from her lunch. Carefully she laid the bread at the base of the tree. Then because she had no thumb piano, she sang an old song that she had known all her life.
With a loud whooshing sound,  a beautiful blue bird swooped out of the branches above Ketti's head and began to eat the bread. When the bird had finished,  she opened her mouth and sang a few pure,  high notes. Then she raised her shiny wings and all of a sudden Ketti heard the rumble of thunder. By the time she reached her home,  giant rain drops were pelting down,  cooling the baking red earth.
Ketti was very happy,  until she told her parents what had happened. "Don't be silly!" scolded her mother. "Nobody believes that bird has anything to do with the rain anymore!" "Your mother is right," said Ketti's father. "The drought has been broken now and we will be fine. Don't go wasting good bread feeding that greedy old bird again!"   Though Ketti didn't argue with her parents,  she felt sure they were wrong. "If only Granny were still alive," she said to herself,  "she would have believed me!" But Ketti's granny had died a few years earlier. The only thing Ketti had left,  was her granny's old thumb piano.
Two weeks passed and there was no more rain. The crops began to shrivel up again and the hungry animals' ribs began to stick out even more. The sun beat down mercilessly from a glaring blue sky.   "I don't care what they say!" thought Ketti. "We need rain. I'm going to feed the bird again tomorrow!"
So,  early the next morning,  after taking a slice of bread and a handful of red berries from the kitchen,  Ketti slipped out of the house. She began to make her way to the centre of the forest.   What she didn't realise,  was that her father was also awake. When he saw what his daughter was doing,  he realised that she was going to feed the rain bird again.
"I'll teach that  child a lesson!" he said to himself angrily. He snatched his bow and arrows and silently followed Ketti into the forest. Just as the bird flew down to eat the food that Ketti had set out for it,  her father raised his bow and released his deadly arrow. The arrow flew straight into the bird's heart. The bird let out a piercing shriek. Terrified,  Ketti spun around − just in time to see her father fall down,  stone dead. Ketti screamed and turned around − just in time to see the arrow fall harmlessly from the bird's glossy body. Then the bird,  unharmed, swooped up into the highest branch of the tree.
Ketti raced out of the forest to a scene of utter devastation. Every animal and every person she saw lay dead on the ground. With a pounding heart,  she ran all the way back to her home.  She quickly found her granny's old thumb piano. "This is my only hope!" she thought. "The rain bird is angry. I have to make her happy again! I HAVE to!"
Half an hour later,  Ketti was back at the base of the big tree. Her body was drenched with sweat and she was gasping for breath. A few paces away from her lay the lifeless body of her father. Ketti looked away quickly,  and with trembling hands,  began to play the thumb piano. She played and played,  until her fingers hurt.
Finally,  what she wanted most in the world happened. Down swooped the bird as if nothing had happened. The bird ate some of the berries still lying on the ground and sang a few notes. Then,  as Ketti played on,  the bird raised her wings. Ketti heard a rustle behind her.
It was her father who had woken up! "I'm sorry!" he said again and again to the big, blue bird. Then he held out his hand to his daughter and they walked slowly back to the village. In the village all the people and animals were alive again.
That night the villagers held a meeting.They all agreed that they had learned a valuable lesson. And from that day onwards,  not one week passed without a special trip to the forest to feed the bird that brought the rain.
Monkey lived in a big tree on the bank of a river. In the middle of the river there was a small island. Lots of fruit trees grew on that island.
Monkey wanted to go and eat the fruit. He saw a big rock half way across the river and he thought he could jump onto the rock,  and then onto the island.
He jumped into the air and landed on the rock. He jumped again and reached the island. He enjoyed eating the fruit and then went back home. He did this several times.
But Crocodile lived in the river with his wife! The wife said,  "Dear husband,  you should go and lie on the rock. The colour of your skin matches the colour of the rock."
A few days later,  Crocodile saw Monkey coming onto the island. He quietly climbed over the rock and carefully lay down on it and kept his face underwater.
Monkey finished eating and was ready to go back. But the rock looked higher than usual,  so he spoke to the rock,  "Dear rock,  you seem to have grown. Are you all right?"
Crocodile was a fool and thought the rock must be a talking rock. So he answered Monkey and said,  "I look bigger because a big crocodile is lying on me."
Monkey said,  "Dear Crocodile,  I know you want to eat me. I am very old and you can have my body. But I must say goodbye to my children in that big tree." So Crocodile gave him a ride on his back!
As soon as they were there,  Monkey climbed the tree and said,  "Thank you for the ride,  my dear friend. Goodbye,  now you can go home!" But Crocodile said,  "But you promised."
Monkey laughed and said,  "What a fool you were to believe me!" and disappeared behind the branches of the tree. Crocodile never did catch clever Monkey!
DeviAgain! Again!I want to knock it down again!Bonda does it. He makes a box tower.He does a good job.He does not smile.He does not frown.
DeviVroom! Vroom!BAM!And she knocks it down again!!!Bonda laughsand claps.He does this every time.Bonda is my best friend.A perfect friend for a girl in a wheelchair!
DeviHi! I'm Devi. I'm from the future! The year 2085.So much has changed since your time.Today, technology makes life wonderful!
DeviMeet Bonda. My best friend. A ROBOT.Did you guess that? Who else would build a tower 50 times?Bonda never gets bored!
DeviBonda can do many things.He can get my secret box from the top shelf.He can lift Baba's desk to find my earring.Things like that.
BondaHumans are useless!Your legs and arms cannot grow taller.My arms have cameras and telescopes!
DeviI have to train Bonda.I "program" him.I show him how to do things.Like on Sunday, I wanted my box.First, I sent Bonda to the shelf. Bonda's screen has a map of my house. I drew the path to the shelf with my finger on the map.Next, I told him to reach up and scan the top shelf.His camera finger took pictures.
DeviBonda showed me the pictures he took.I touched the picture of the box I wanted."That is my secret box, Bonda," I said.Can you bring it to me?Now, I only have to say, "Secret box!" And off he goes.Once Bonda learns, he never forgets. Not like humans!
DeviSo, that is my best friend.I have human friends too.We play and fight and go to school.But I love Bonda best. He never gets mad at me!
DeviRobots do not have feelings.But, shhh! Don't tell Bonda I said that!It might make him feel bad!BondaThat is not logical, Devi!If I do not have feelings, how can I feel bad?Silly humans. Pah!
DeviThe best part is, I have Bonda all to myself! I never get jealous. Because I am his only friend!BondaThat is not true. I have other robot friends! Wait! Does Devi only like me BECAUSE she thinks I have no friends? And no feelings? Oh no! I feel mad, and sad, and...
DeviBonda, are you okay? You are getting hot! You are not working!I will take care of you now. I will shut you down. It will be like going to sleep. Then I will start you again.BondaDevi's eyes are wet. She is sad. I feel sad. But, wet eyes mean she cares about me.So I also feel happy! I feel happy-sad.
Whirr! Hum! Bonda reboots.DeviBonda? Bonda, do you hear me?Is your memory gone? I want you to remember our fun! Our love...
BondaAha! Love. That sad-happy feeling is love!
BondaHi, Devi!What can I do?Do you want me to stack the boxes?Do you want me to get your secret box?DeviOh, Bonda!You're all right!I am so glad!
BondaI do something very odd.No one programmed me to do it.I wrap my arms around my friend, Devi.This is not logical!
Who or what is a robot?A robot is “any electro-mechanical machine guided by a computer program or electronic circuits." It doesn't have to look like a human. There are robots all around us, already!Really? Where?Well, they are in factories, warehouses, orchards, hospitals and even homes. They may look like large mechanical arms.Car factories use these for welding, gluing and painting car parts. Or they may look like tiny cameras, attached to thin hair-like tubes,.Hospitals use these to entering our intestines and arteries to check them out. Some robots look like flat round discs, buzzing around.Homes and offices use these to clean floors at night when everyone is asleep. Some look like small wheeled vehicles, going into war zones.Soldiers use these to find dangerous landmines.Other robots roll across the surfaces of the moon or Mars.They take pictures and sendsamples to send to scientists back on Earth.Will there be a Bonda for every Devi by the year 2085? We'll have to wait and see!
Have you ever seen a robot?If you have ever used, or even seen, a computer or a smartphone, you have 'seen' a robot!Yes, they are in those devices as well. Some of them even have names, like Siri and Cortana.They can help us find useful information for school projects, traffic reports and more. They can book our bus and train tickets, and order our groceries.They can even tell us exactly how many calories we have burnt after a game of football!What does the future of robots look like? We may not have robots walking our streets in India by 2040.But we will definitely be surrounded by robots of one kind or another without knowing it. It is quite likely that there will be driverless “robot” cars on our streets. We may have microscopic robots in our contact lenses that help us take pictures.We won't even have to hold our phones or cameras up to take them.But how will we take selfies?? And little airborne robots called drones will be flying all around.They will deliver letters, packages and kababs, putting delivery boys out of business!As for 2085, 45 years AFTER that, who knows what robots will be up to?
Long ago, there was a man who had a very serious wound on his leg. He could not stand or walk. This man lived in a village with his wife and their children.
The couple had three sons and one daughter. The daughter's name was Nangila. Her duty was to take care of her father. The sons worked on the land and grazed animals.
Nangila was a beautiful girl. All the villagers liked and respected her. Her parents wanted a good husband for Nangila. They set a difficult task in order to find theright man.
Anyone who wanted to marry Nangila would have to get a herb from a lake near the village. This herb would healher father's wound. Butthe lake was filled with dangerous spirits.
Some men tried to get the herb but returned without it. Some men did not return from the lake at all.
Nangila felt worried. Not even her brothers would go to the lake. One day, she decided to fetch the herb herself. Her mother said, "My daughter, if strong men have failed, how will you succeed?" But Nangila had made up her mind.
On the way to the lake, Nangila met an old woman carrying wood. She helped the woman to carry her firewood. The old woman was grateful. She said to Nangila, "I will tell you how to reach the spirit lake and what to do when you get there."
When she reached the shore of the lake, Nangila saw the spirit family drinking and dancing. She waited and watched. One by one, the spirits fell asleep.
Once the spirits were all sleeping, Nangila dived intothe lake. She found the herb and put it in her bag. As she swam back to land, the waves were rising.
When Nangila reached the shore the spirits were awake. She was afraid, but she sang the song the old woman taught her, "I, daughter of Wekesa, am from the lake. I came because men are too scared to come. My father needs this herb to heal his wound. That is why I am here, in the land where many are scared to reach, for you are the rulers."
Nangila's voice was so sweet that the spirits asked her to sing for them again and again. Her singing sent the spirits back to sleep. Then Nangila ran very fast until she got to her village.
Everyone was waiting for Nangila to return. After treating his wound with the herb her father was able to stand again. The entire village danced and praised Nangila.

When we go walking and the road is long, we’ll walk together singing a song.
I am with you and you are with me. A journey is fun with our family.
I’ll keep you cosy like a mother hen. She keeps her chicks warm under her wing.
If the rain starts to fall down from the sky, like that good hat I’ll keep your face dry.
If storm clouds get angry and grumble and moan, be brave, why cry? You’re not alone.
We’re walking together so we never get bored. Look up! Look around! See where we’ve explored!
If you see something that’s funny to see, I don’t want to miss it. Please share it with me!
If your feet start to hurt from the distance we’ve passed, don’t worry, we’ve made it! Here’s the clinic at last.
We all need to check our throat, lungs and ears. Get strong as you grow, it’s no reason for tears.
Do you think it’s scary? Here, hold my hand. She’ll check your blood pressure with this clever armband.
They give us our medicine, tell us what we should know, to keep us all healthy. Now back home we go.
It’s okay to be tired, there’s so much we’ve seen. Now it’s your bedtime. Sleep well and sweet dreams.

When I am happy, so is she.
When I cry, she cries too.
But I cannot hear her voice. My friend lives inside the mirror.
“Come out,” I tell her, “we will play.” She does not come out.
I am not happy. I go to sleep.
She comes out of the mirror in my sleep! And we have fun.
We play, we run, we shout and scream together.
When I talk to her, she also talks to me.
In the morning, my friend will go back into the mirror.
But I don't mind at all. We will play again in my dreams!

Tamara was a five-year-old girl who lived with her family. Their village was near a forest that had wild animals.
Tamara was obedient to her parents. She looked after sheep and goats.
Tamara loved listening to birds singing as she took care of the animals. As the birds sang, she put her own words to the tune.
Tamara was too young for school. Her parents only allowed their older children, Nashipae and Tasieku, to go to school. It was 10 kilometres away.
Nashipae and Tasieku went with other children from the village in the morning and returned in the evening. They carried food in small containers.
Tamara asked her mother, "When will I go to school?" Her mother answered, "You will go soon, my dear child."
One day, a car arrived with the chief and two ladies. The chief made sure that children went to school at the right age.
People believed that if a child was able to stretch her hand over her head and touch the ear, she was ready to start school.
The chief asked, "How old are you?" Tamara replied, "I am five years old." "Let's see if you can go to school," the chief said.
One of the ladies took Tamara's right arm and gently placed it over her head. Tamara touched her left ear.
Tamara would go to a different school than Nashipae and Tasieku. It was new and closer to home.
Tamara was very happy. She thought, "I will read and write like Nashipae and Tasieku."
A long time ago,  three girls went out to collect wood.
It was a hot day so they went down to the river to swim. They played and splashed and swam in the water.
Suddenly,  they realised that it was late. They hurried back to the village.
When they were nearly home,  Nozibele put her hand to her neck. She had forgotten her necklace! "Please come back with me!" she begged her friends. But her friends said it was too late.
Nozibele went back to the river alone. She found her necklace and began hurrying home. But,  she got lost in the dark.
In the distance she saw light coming from a hut. She walked quickly towards it and knocked at the door.
To her surprise,  a dog opened the door and said,  "What do you want?" "I'm lost and I need a place to sleep," said Nozibele. "Come in,  or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele went in.
The dog said,  "Cook for me!" "But I've never cooked for a dog before," Nozibele answered. "Cook,  or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele cooked some food for the dog.
Then the dog said,  "Make the bed for me!" Nozibele answered,  "I've never made a bed for a dog." "Make the bed,  or I'll bite you!" the dog said. Nozibele made the bed.
Every day she had to cook and sweep and wash for the dog. Then one day the dog said,  "Nozibele,  today I have to visit some friends. Sweep the house,  cook the food and wash my things before I come back."
As soon as the dog had gone,  Nozibele took three hairs from her head. She put one hair under the bed,  one behind the door,  and one in the kraal. Then she ran home as fast as she could.
When the dog came back,  he looked for Nozibele. "Nozibele,  where are you?" he shouted. "I'm here,  under the bed," said the first hair. "I'm here,  behind the door," said the second hair. "I'm here,  in the kraal," said the third hair.
The dog knew that Nozibele had tricked him. He ran and ran all the way to the village. But Nozibele's brothers were waiting there with big sticks. The dog turned and ran away and has never been seen since.

Once upon a time, there was a boy who was so ugly that nobody loved him. Not even his parents. At home,  he would sit alone while his family watched television.
At school, he would sit alone while other children were playing.
He would walk alone behind the other boys when they went to fetch the cattle. They didn't want to walk with him.
One day he decided to leave home. He walked until he got to an indigenous forest. He started to feel scared, but was comforted by the thought that nobody would speak to him. Because nobody loved him.
He was about to enter the forest when an old, dirty,  ugly woman came up to him. She greeted him and asked why he was going into the scary forest. The boy was shocked to hear someone speaking to him. He told the old woman that he wasn't going anywhere. Because no one loved him.
The old woman asked if he needed help. He quickly said, "Yes." The old woman said that before she helped him, she wanted him to lick her face until she was clean and beautiful.
The boy didn't have any other choice in order to get the help he needed. He licked the sleep from her eyes,  the snot from her nose, and the wax from her ears. He licked her face until she was clean and beautiful.
The old woman thanked him. She said, "You will find many wonderful things in the forest, but don't take any of these things. Only bring back the root that you find."
The boy ran, wanting to see all of the things in the forest. Before he could enter the forest, the old woman called him. She said, "Boy! Come back here!" He ran back to her. She repeated, "Don't take any of the wonderful things in the forest. Only bring back the root that you find." The boy nodded and ran off.
Before he could enter the forest, he heard a voice saying, "Boy! Come back here!" He started to feel confused about what the old woman wanted. He ran back to her again. She said, "You will find many wonderful things in the forest. But only bring back the root that you find." The boy nodded and ran off.
Just after he had entered the forest, he heard a voice saying, "Boy! Come back here!" He again went back to the old woman. She said, "Listen to me. Only bring back the root that you find. Don't take anything else from the forest." The boy was annoyed with the repetition. He ran into the forest.
Once he was in the forest, he saw a bowl filled with money. He took the money and put it in his pocket. All of a sudden, he thought about what the old woman said. He took the money out of his pocket and put it back in the bowl.
He continued walking. He saw some splendid new clothes. He took off his clothes and put on the new ones. Then he thought about what the old woman had said. He took off the new clothes and put his old ones back on.
Next he saw the root. It was withered from the sun. He asked himself what the old woman thought he would do with the root. Next to the root, there was a bowl of food. The food smelled delicious and the boy was hungry. He couldn't stop himself from eating.
When he had finished,  he remembered what the old woman had told him. The old woman had said he must only take the root. He looked around for the root, but he couldn't see it anymore.
The boy left the forest feeling disappointed. He went back to tell the old woman what had happened. But the old woman was gone.
Once upon a time, Sly Jackal woke up early in the morning. He was very hungry. His tummy gave a big growl. GRRrrrrr! He jumped up and went searching for food.
He wandered around the forest for hours without getting any food. The sun was very hot. Sly Jackal could barely see in front of him. All he could think of was his hunger pangs.
"Aaauuuu!" Sly Jackal let out a loud scream. He fell into a well right in front of him. He was so hungry that he did not spot it.
"Oh my hat!" he thought. "I have to get out of this well. I will die of hunger."
Sly Jackal screamed and shouted, "Help! Anyone help!" Donkey was grazing a few metres away from the well. Donkey heard Sly Jackal's desperate cry. He came rushing.
"What is the matter?" Donkey was very worried. "The water in this well is cool and sweet. I am bored swimming alone. I need someone to help me swim. Please will you join me?"
"The sun is very hot," said Donkey. "I can't swim very well though." "Jump in! I will help you come out of the well," promised the Sly Jackal.
Donkey jumped into the well. The water was so cool. He was free from the heat. Before he knew it, the jackal had jumped on his back and out of the well. Sly Jackal laughed and ran away. Donkey was trapped in the well. He started screaming and shouting, "Help! Anyone help!"

Once upon a time,  Rabbit and Monkey were friends. One day,  in a time of famine,  Rabbit invited Monkey over to play.
Rabbit said,  "Let's play cooking each other!" Monkey asked,  "How can we do that?"
Rabbit answered,  "First,  we have to make a fire."
Rabbit continued,  "We fill a pot with water,  and then put it on the fire."
"I will get in first. When I beat on the lid of the pot,  you open it. Then I will get out." Rabbit explained. Monkey agreed.
So,  Rabbit got in the pot first.
When the water started to warm up,  Rabbit knocked,  and Monkey opened the lid.
When it was Monkey's turn,  Rabbit put a big stone on the lid of the pot and sat on top of it as well!
When the water started to boil,  Monkey knocked,  but Rabbit didn't open the lid.
Monkey died,  and Rabbit ate his best friend!

One harsh winter, many people in the land were sick. Ma Monikazi’s cheeks burned. Sweat dripped from her body. She wanted to hold the icy grass to her face to cool down. Under her blanket she held her belly and sang to the baby inside her: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”Her stomach growled when the baby’s powerful kicks woke her at night. She ate the leftover meat in the cooking pot, hungry for life.
One bright night the moon was bigger, fatter and pinker than ever. Her breath came fast. The baby was ready. The aunties in the birthing room rubbed her back and warmed the water. When Monikazi held her beautiful daughter in her arms, she knew she was a special girl, a fighter.What a blessing! Her name is Nontsikelelo. She will be the mother of all blessings.
Nontsikelelo was beautiful and strong with crinkling black button eyes. She loved her older brother, Mcengi. He made her laugh and so the laughter spread. She loved to eat meat before she had teeth. Her favourite aunt always kept a little portion on the side of her plate for Ntsiki. Mcengi chased the chickens that scratched in the garden where Ma Monikazi grew spinach and squash to feed her family. Ntsiki ran after him as her legs grew strong.Ma Monikazi had another baby boy, Velaphi, and another, Qudalele. Finally another sister, Nomyaleko. Little Ntsiki folded napkins and washed the baby clothes. She swept the house and fed the fire. She picked up her baby brother when he cried and tickled him till he laughed.She taught them to sing: “Be strong, little one. Winter is gone. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”
Qingqiwe, her grandfather, raised horses. His favourite was Shishi, a glossy black mare. As soon as Ntsiki was old enough, he hoisted her on to the saddle in front of him. His strong arms reached around her. He laced the reins through her fingers.He taught her to talk softly to Shishi, to groom her with a hard bristled brush. When she stroked its glossy coat, Albertina whispered, “You are the most beautiful creature. Thank you for letting me ride on your back.”Her father, Bonilizwe, came home from the mines at Christmas. Ntsiki pulled herself up onto Shishi’s broad back. She rode out to meet him at the bus stop. Ntsiki sat tall and straight. Her knees held firm. She handled the reins with gentle fingers.How proud Bonilizwe was of his daughter. The biggest smile Ntsiki had ever seen covered her father’s face.
On her sixth birthday she went to school. “You must choose an English name,” said the Presbyterian teacher, but Ntsiki liked her own name. “Why do I need a new name?” she asked. The teacher scowled and read the names aloud: “Adah, Agnes, Albertina, Anna.” What did they mean? Ntsiki liked the long name best. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had rhythm. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had bounce. Albertina was a name you didn’t mess with.When her cousin married a handsome man from a nearby town, Albertina was chosen as an umkhapi. The maid of honour! Weeks before the wedding, she stitched her isikhakha, the short traditional skirt, and threaded bright beads onto her amatikiti. Her mother gave her the white flag and said, “You have a big job, my blessing.”At the bend in the road Albertina waved the flag, then turned Shishi back, leading everybody from miles around to the ceremony. People would gossip if she made a mistake, but the guests lined the road. They ululated and sang. They threw down flowers for the horse and the girl.
Her mother was often sick and needed Albertina to look after the home. In her last year of primary school, Albertina was the oldest pupil in the school. She was chosen to be the head girl and wore her badge with pride.Her best friend, Betty, told her about a competition, saying, “You must apply, my clever friend.” “What is the prize?” asked Albertina, growing curious.“A scholarship to high school!” said Betty. “You must apply. You’ll win it, for sure.”
Albertina studied until the candle burned down. She practised sums. She practised spelling. She sharpened her pencils and gave her shoes an extra shine. Next morning she passed Shishi in her paddock. The horse whinnied and stamped the ground.The test began. Albertina’s fingers shook. The sums were tricky. Her mouth went dry. Her hand cramped on her pencil but she continued. “Well done, Albertina!” said her teacher at the end. The important official arrived and called the top two students to the stage. “Well done to Albertina for full marks,” he said, “but you are too old. The scholarship goes to…”Albertina tried not to cry. “That’s unfair,” shouted Betty, hopping with fury. “That wasn’t in the rules!” How would Albertina go to high school now? She dragged her feet all the way home.The teacher wrote to the newspaper about the unfair decision. Brother Joe at the Catholic Mission station read the story over his breakfast. He cracked his boiled egg with an extra flourish. He pushed the newspaper across the table to Father Bernard. He didn’t like the story one bit either.
Soon enough there was a scholarship for Albertina. Mariazell near Matatiele was a long way from Xolobe, but the whole village erupted. Their home girl was off to high school. She would make them proud. They threw a party like no other. The women brewed the sorghum beer and lit the fires. They slaughtered chickens and stirred up pots of meat. Albertina smiled till her face ached.She packed her brown suitcase and polished her shoes again. Before setting off on the bus to Matatiele, she said goodbye to Shishi. Albertina brushed her coat and stroked her wiry mane. She whispered all her questions into the horse’s silky ear: What if I get lost? Will I make new friends? Will I still be clever so far from home? Shishi whinnied and stamped the ground.
School days started well before sunrise. The girls washed quickly in the cold water and swept the dormitories before Mass. The milky porridge was never quite enough; the stew not as tasty as Aunty’s back home. But Albertina studied hard. She played netball on sunny afternoons.In her school holidays Albertina worked at the mission station. She rubbed and scrubbed against the zinc washboard. She boiled sheets in copper tubs, then wound them through the wringer. She hoed and tilled the school garden but missed her family. Who was telling her brothers and sisters funny stories? Who wiped their eyes when they cried? Who tickled them until they laughed?Albertina loved the nuns who taught her. Could she become a holy sister? “But nuns earn no salary,” said Father Bernard. “Perhaps you should become a nurse? You’ll be paid while you study.”
Albertina took a train to Johannesburg. She bought a smart white uniform, new navy shoes and a shiny red fountain pen. Sick people came all day to the hospital. She cleaned their wounds with careful fingers. She held the old people gently. When the babies cried, she sang: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!Some nights Albertina worked till dawn. She looked out the window and thought of her family. Were the children hungry? Did they go to school? Who was riding Shishi? She remembered the dark green spinach. She missed the scent of the earth. There was no vegetable garden here. There was nowhere for a horse.Albertina never went to parties. She saved every shilling. On her days off she learned to play tennis. Whoosh! Plop! She whacked the ball across the net. Always, she wished for a little more money to send home.
Walter Sisulu was a brave and clever man who dreamed of freedom for South Africa. His big smile captured Albertina’s eye. They walked together down the city streets. Her delicate hand rested on his arm. Walter wanted Albertina to be the mother of his children.Bright ribbons decorated the Bantu Men’s Social Centre on their wedding day. Albertina’s long-sleeved dress had a swirling train of lace. Many friends blessed their special day. Albertina planted flowers in her little garden. Within a year, Max was born. Albertina had become a mother. One day people would call her the mother of the nation.Max had his mother’s black button eyes and his father’s round chin. He was the hope for their future. Albertina wanted to fight for a new South Africa, so that Max could be free. When he cried, she sang: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”
Police came in the middle of the night, banging on the door. Albertina scolded the men who messed up her house. “How rude you are!” she said, “trampling mud inside my home.”In the morning Albertina’s favourite flowers lay crushed beneath their footprints. She remembered chasing the chickens from her vegetable garden back in Xolobe and set about replanting her garden. The earth, she knew, would recover.She would support her husband who kept many secrets and hid from the police.
She joined the women and worked to organise a march to Pretoria. The women refused to carry a pass. They sang, “Wathint’ abafazi; wathint’ imbokodo! You strike a woman; you strike a rock!”Many hard years followed after Walter’s arrest. He was jailed on Robben Island for 26 years. Albertina, also, was sent to jail many times. Often she was scared. Often she was lonely.But even on the darkest nights, she could see a sliver of moon through the window in her cell. She sang the song that Ma Monikazi sang before she was born: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”
Little Ant loved to read. Little Ant was often teased. "Ants don't read. Ants must feed. Ants collect the food they need."
Little Ant would read all day, he'd read and read the day away.
The other ants took what they found to store for winter underground.
His mum and dad got really mad, and Little Ant felt really bad.
In autumn when the leaves fall down, the ants must keep food underground.
The Queen wants food to fill the store, so all the ants must work some more.
Little Ant begins to shout about a place he read about. "A restaurant is what we need, a place where people go to feed. It says so in the books I read."
The ants go marching one by one. They march into the setting sun.
And Little Ant said, "Hey,  there's one!"
The ants go marching one by one, carrying a burger,  carrying a bun.
When they return the Queen is glad. The stores are full. They cheer like mad.
Ant gets hugs from mum and dad.
His baby sister takes his hand, "Now I think I understand. The way you love to read a book makes me want to take a look."
This is a fat king.
The fat king has a thin dog.The fat king and his thin dog go for a walk.
The dog sees a bird.The dog runs after the bird.
The king runs after the dog.
They run and run.They run and run for many days.
The king catches the dog.
Now the fat king is thin.
Now the fat king is thin.
Once upon a time, all the animals lived together in the bush. The rooster was their chief.
Rooster told the animals that the comb on his head was made of fire. For this reason all the animals feared Rooster.
In those days, fire was made using a bow drill. One rainy day, Leopard's bow drill got wet. She could not make a fire to warm her family.
So Leopard sent her cubs to ask Rooster for fire from his comb.
Rooster was in a bad mood. He sent the cubs away without any fire. Leopard was upset when the cubs came back with nothing.
Late that night when Rooster was asleep, Leopard and her cubs went to steal the fire from Rooster's comb. Leopard picked some dry grass outside Rooster's house.
She put the dry grass next to the comb on the sleeping Rooster's head. But the grass did not catch fire. She carefully touched the comb. It was cold!
The cubs also touched the comb. There was no fire! The leopard family all started laughing.
The leopards' laughter woke Rooster and the chickens. Rooster turned his comb towards them, shouting, "You should run away. Aren't you afraid?"
Leopard replied, "We touched your comb and we know about your trick! We'll go back and tell the other animals. They will be angry with you."
The chickens were afraid. They ran away and Rooster ran with them. The chickens left the bush and went to live with people.
Since that time, chickens have feared leopards and lived with people for protection.
Odongo and Apiyo lived in the city with their father. They looked forward to the holidays. Not only because school was closed, but because they went to visit their grandmother. She lived in a fishing village near a large lake.
Odongo and Apiyo were excited because it was time to visit their grandmother again. They packed their bags and got ready for their long journey the next day. They could not sleep and talked about the holiday the whole night.
Early the next morning, they left for the village in their father's car. They drove past mountains, wild animals, and tea plantations. They counted cars and sang songs.
After a while, the children were tired and fell asleep.
Father woke up Odongo and Apiyo as they arrived in the village. They found Nyar-Kanyada, their grandmother, resting on a mat under a tree. In thier language, Nyar-Kanyada means “daughter of the people of Kanyada.” She was a strong and beautiful woman.
Nyar-Kanyada welcomed them into the house. She danced around the room singing with joy. Her grandchildren were excited to give her the presents they brought from the city. “First open my gift,” said Odongo. “No, my gift first!” said Apiyo.
After she opened the presents, Nyar-Kanyada blessed her grandchildren in a traditional way.
Then Odongo and Apiyo went outside. They chased butterflies and birds.
They climbed trees and splashed in the water of the lake.
When it was dark they returned to the house for dinner. Before they could finish eating, they were falling asleep!
The next day, the children's father drove back to the city leaving them with Nyar-Kanyada.
Odongo and Apiyo helped their grandmother with household chores. They fetched water and firewood. They collected eggs from the chickens and picked vegetables from the garden.
Nyar-Kanyada taught her grandchildren to make soft ugali to eat with stew. She showed them how to make coconut rice to eat with roast fish.
One morning, Odongo took his grandmother's cows to graze. They ran onto a neighbour's farm. The farmer was angry with Odongo. He threatened to keep the cows for eating his crops. After that day, the boy made sure that the cows did not get into trouble again.
On another day, the children went to the market place with Nyar­Kanyada.She had a stall selling vegetables, sugar and soap. Apiyo liked to tell customers the price of items. Odongo would pack the items that customers bought.
At the end of the day they drank chai tea together. They helped grandmother to count the money she earned.
But too soon the holidays were over. The children had to go back to the city. Nyar-Kanyada gave Odongo a cap and Apiyo a sweater. She packed food for their journey.
When their father came to fetch them, they did not want to leave. The children begged Nyar-Kanyada to go with them to the city. She smiled and said, “I am too old for the city. I will be waiting for you to visit me again.”
Odongo and Apiyo both hugged her tightly, and said goodbye.
When Odongo and Apiyo went back to school they told their friends about life in the village. Some children felt that life in the city was good. Others felt that the village was better. But most of all, everyone agreed that Odongo and Apiyo had a wonderful grandmother!
Sara has a canoe. Her canoe is big. It is by the riverside.
Some women come to the river. One woman has a basin of fruit. Another woman has a chicken. Another woman has a goat. Another woman has two goats. They ask Sara, "How can we get to the other side of the river?" Sara says, "Get in my canoe!"
Then, some men arrive. One man has a fish. Another man has a bicycle. Another man has a sack of maize.
Another man has two sacks of maize. They ask Sara, "How can we get to the other side of the river?" Sara replies, "Get in my canoe!"
Some animals come to the river. They ask Sara, "How can we get across the river?" Sara says, "Get in my canoe!"
The animals get in the canoe. The dog gets in the canoe. The cat gets in the canoe. The monkey gets in the canoe. The rabbit gets in the canoe. The turtle gets in the canoe. The gazelle gets in the canoe.
The elephant arrives at the river. He asks, "How can I get to the other side of the river?" Sara says, "Get in my canoe!" The elephant gets in the canoe. The canoe fills up with water.
The canoe is too small. There isn't enough room.
Sara says, "Hold on! First I'll take the women."
Sara says, "Second, I'll take the men."
Sara says, "Finally, I'll take the animals."
The elephant says, "I'm just going to walk!"
It is one week until Thato’s birthday. That’s seven whole days!
His mama says: “Your birthday present will be a BIG surprise!” Thato wonders: what will it be?
On Monday Thato thinks: “Maybe I will get giant wings so I can fly high in the sky like a bird…”
On Tuesday Thato thinks: “Maybe I will have a birthday cake as big as a house!”
On Wednesday Thato thinks: “Maybe I will get a rocket ship to whizz up to the moon.”
On Thursday Thato thinks: “Maybe I will get fins so I can swim under the water like a fish.”
On Friday Thato thinks: “Maybe I will get magic soccer boots and score a thousand goals!”
On Saturday Thato thinks: “Maybe I will get a key that opens a box filled with treasure!”
On Sunday it is Thato’s birthday. Mama smiles and says: “Come and see your surprise!”
It is the best present ever. Thato’s big brother Kudzai has come to visit all the way from the big city!
Thato smiles and smiles and his big brother lifts him up in the air and hugs him.Kudzai asks: “What do you want to do for your birthday, little brother?”
And Thato knows exactly what they will do the whole day long.
Once upon a time, the animals decided to have a party. But it was not for all of them. It was only for the animals that had horns.
The rabbit was getting ready for the party. But then he found out that the party was not for everyone. It was just for animals  with horns.
The rabbit went somewhere and got some horns. Then he put them on his head and went to the party.
During the party the rabbit ate and drank and danced.
This made him tired and he fell down in the sun. But while the rabbit was sleeping, the horns fell off!
Then all the animals discovered that the rabbit was not the kind of animal they wanted. So they pulled his ears till they got bigger and bigger.
Then they ran away. And that's the reason why rabbits have big ears!
When we go walking and the road is long, we'll walk together singing a song.
I am with you and you are with me. A journey is fun with our family.
I'll keep you cosy like a mother hen. She keeps her chicks warm under her wing.
If the rain starts to fall down from the sky, like that good hat I'll keep your face dry.
If storm clouds get angry and grumble and moan, be brave, why cry? You're not alone.
We're walking together so we never get bored. Look up! Look around! See where we've explored!
If you see something that's funny to see, I don't want to miss it. Please share it with me!
If your feet start to hurt from the distance we've passed, don't worry, we've made it! Here's the clinic at last.
We all need to check our throat, lungs and ears. Get strong as you grow, it's no reason for tears.
Do you think it's scary? Here, hold my hand. She'll check your blood pressure with this clever armband.
They give us our medicine, tell us what we should know, to keep us all healthy. Now back home we go.
It's okay to be tired, there's so much we've seen. Now it's your bedtime. Sleep well and sweet dreams.
The Winter cold had passed. Spring was coming to Nkanyezi's village. Soon the villagers would gather to celebrate the new season. Nkanyezi looked forward to the Spring festival more than any other day in the year.
One warm morning, Nkanyezi overheard two village elders talking about the festival. "The people of Ndlovu have lost their spirit of celebration," one sighed. "How can we have a Spring festival in a village that has forgotten how to celebrate?" asked another.
Nkanyezi was worried. "How will the sun shine again unless we sing to wake it from its winter slumber?" she asked herself. Nkanyezi thought for a long time. "I must find what we have lost," she decided. "I must go in search of things that will bring back the spirit of celebration to my village."
The elders gave Nkanyezi their blessing for the journey. They gave her a bag to carry the things she would find. Nkanyezi was afraid, but she believed she would succeed.
Nkanyezi walked all day. She hiked up a hill, and down into a valley. She sailed across the great river, and climbed between sharp rocks. She marched across the plains until she reached the shadow of the red mountains.
As night was closing in, Nkanyezi arrived at a village of patterns and colours as she had never seen before. She told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people.The mother of this tribe gave Nkanyezi a gift. She told the girl, "With love we give to you this paint to restore colour to your village." Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the paint in her bag. Early the next morning she went on her way.
Nkanyezi walked all day, through a vast forest of giant trees. As the sky became too dark for her to see, she heard the sound of beating drums. She hurried towards the drumming, feeling the spirit of dance coming to her tired feet.
Nkanyezi found herself in the village of the Bhubezi. People were sitting around a fire, drumming and singing. She had never before heard such wonderful music. She told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people. The Bhubezi invited her to rest and stay the night.
In the morning the chief called on Nkanyezi. "My child," he said, "here is a special drum. It plays a new song every time you beat it." Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the drum in her bag. She went on her way again, delighted with this gift of music and dance.
On the third day of her journey, as she passed a field of fat cows, her nose started to tingle. An aroma tickled her taste buds and her mouth started to water. She followed the scent, and arrived in a village to find people standing over steaming pots of stew. This tribe was famous for its feasts and Nkanyezi had never before tasted such flavours. After she had eaten her fill, she told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people.
The next day, the council of cooks gave her a secret spice blend. "Our daughter," they said, "with these spices, happy tummies are guaranteed! We give you the gift of good food." Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the spices in her bag. She knew she had everything she needed. With new energy she started the long journey back to the village of Ndlovu.
When she arrived home the villagers gathered around her to hear of her adventures. She told them the tales of what she had seen, heard, and eaten. Then she opened her bag to share the gifts given. The villagers rejoiced to receive these treasures. The generosity of others and the courage of Nkanyezi brought back colour, song and dance to the people.  And so the spirit of celebration was restored to the village of Ndlovu.
All of us went to the fun fair.
Father bought brother fancy glasses. Mother bought me a bright blue cap. The baby got sugar candy.
On the way home,  a very strong wind came. It blew my cap away.
My cap got stuck on a branch of a big old tree.
I cried a lot. And I did not eat my dinner.
Later that night,  the moon came up. It looked at my cap in the big old tree.
The moon tried on my cap. It smiled happily. I had to smile too.
After school the next day,  my mother gave me a shiny new red cap. "The moon sent it," she said.
That night,  both the moon and I wore our caps and smiled. We were happy.
Do you think the sun needs a hat?
Guess which cap I am wearing today!
Once upon a time, there lived a man who had plenty of everything – a large fertile farm, with cattle, sheep, and goats. But, as he grew old, he grew sad, because one thing was missing. He did not have a wife.
Standing under a tree one day, he had a brilliant idea.If he couldn't find a wife, perhaps he could make one?
So he set to work to shape a beautiful woman from a strong branch of the tree. When he had finished making the statue, he touched her eyes, and they opened. He blew gently on her, and she came alive.
She was truly the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He knelt before her, and asked her to be his wife.
He gave her a colourful apron, beads, and a head ring, the sign of a married woman. And he built her a house with the mud and grass that used to lie at the foot of her trunk. "Only one thing I beg of you," he said to his wife. "Never tell anyone where you come from."
But before long, the young men from a neighbouring village began talking among themselves. "How can such an old man have such a beautiful young wife?" So they decided to steal her and take her to their own kraal.
The old man was heartbroken. He felt he could not live without her. But then he thought, "Perhaps if I have something of hers, I would not feel so sad?" So he sent his doves to find her, to sing to her, and to bring back something of hers to him.
When they found her, they sang to her in the language of birds. "Tree woman, tree woman. More beautiful than any other. Your husband has sent us. To bring back your apron!"
She gave them her apron, and they flew over the hill, over the river, back to her husband. He held the apron to his face, and was comforted for a little while.
But his longing did not go away. So again he sent his doves to sing to her:Tree woman, tree woman! More beautiful than any otherYour husband has sent us To bring back your head ring! And back they flew with the head ring, the sign of a married woman.
He held the head ring and sighed for his wife, far away in the kraal of other people. He called his doves again. He told them to go to her and sing: Tree woman, tree woman More beautiful than any other Your husband has sent us To bring back your life!
So away they went the third time. They perched on her shoulders. As they sang, each bird pecked out an eye. Immediately she turned again into a statue. Her feet and arms fell away. Then her head. And she fell to the ground.
Her husband slowly rolled her wooden trunk to the river. He stood her up with her roots in the water. Nourished by sun and soil, she grew leaves again.
And when the wind blows, the leaves sigh. Just as a woman does when she longs for her husband.

Many years ago,  the Lizard and the Frog were friends. One day  they decided to look for girlfriends in the city.
The Frog was jealous of  the Lizard's shining and brilliant skin.
He said,  "What did you do to look so beautiful? Look at me,  I am so ugly. What can I do about my skin?"
The Lizard said,  "Listen! Put some water in a pot and put it on the fire. Next you....."
But the Frog said,  "I know already,  I know! Keep quiet,  my friend!" And he left.
Frog arrived home and put some water in a pot.
When the water began to boil,  he threw himself into it.
His skin was burnt and his tail came off!
Instead of being brilliant and beautiful like the Lizard,  he was even more ugly!
I dance when I am happy, I dance when I am sad, I dance when I am lonely, I dance when I am angry.
My teacher says, "Sit still! Don't dance about all day."
But my mother says, "Dancing makes you healthy. Dancing makes you tall. One day you'll be a dancer, And surprise them all!"
And I say, "One day I'll dance and people will pay just to see me leap and twirl."Her dancing is SO good," they'll say."
One day, mama bought different fruits.
"When can we have some fruit?" we asked. "We will eat the fruit tonight," said mama.
My brother Rahim is greedy. He tasted all the fruit. He ate a lot of it.
"Look at what Rahim did!" shouted my little brother. "Rahim is naughty and selfish," I said.
Mama was angry with Rahim.
We were also angry with Rahim. But Rahim was not sorry.
"Are you going to punish Rahim?" asked little brother.
"Rahim, you will be sorry soon," warned mama.
Rahim started feeling unwell.
"My stomach is painful," whispered Rahim.
Mama knew why Rahim was sick. "The fruit is punishing Rahim," she thought.
Later, Rahim said sorry to us. "I will never be so greedy again," he promised. We believed him.
Once upon a time,  the animals decided to have a party. But it was not for all of them. It was only for the animals that had horns.
The rabbit was getting ready for the party. But then he found out that the party was not for everyone. It was just for animals with horns.
The rabbit went somewhere and got some horns. Then he put them on his head and went to the party.
During the party the rabbit ate and drank and danced.
This made him tired and he fell down in the sun. But while the rabbit was sleeping,  the horns fell off!
Then all the animals discovered that the rabbit was not the kind of animal they wanted. So they pulled his ears till they got bigger and bigger.
Then they ran away. And that's the reason why rabbits have big ears!
This is cow. Cow is cool!
By day,  it is an ordinary cow.
Flying a kite.
Kicking a ball.
By night,  a supercow!
Saving lives.
And fighting crime.
But if you close your eyes really tight,  and make a wish.
Cow might come to visit you too!
The end.
There once lived a chicken, called Cikizwa, who was an orphan.One day Cikizwa was out looking for food when she saw a mole coming out of his hole. She started speaking to the mole, but he ignored her.
From that day on, the mole and Cikizwa became great friends. The friends often hugged each other tightly. They loved and looked after each other.
Elephant often said really unkind things to Cikizwa to try and make her unhappy. One morning, when Cikizwa greeted Elephant, he snubbed her and said, “Ha, ha, ha! Go away, you orphan! What do you want from me? You’re so skinny. It’s as if you haven’t had enough mealies to eat!” Cikizwa was heartbroken.
The next day it rained and rained. It rained so heavily that many animals were swept away by the nearby river. Cikizwa was safe in her little coop because her father had been clever enough to build a drain nearby so that it didn’t get flooded.
But Cikizwa still felt sad about what had happened to some of her friends.Once the rain stopped, beautiful, colourful flowers appeared and there was a cool breeze. Cikizwa was out enjoying the sunshine when she saw Elephant limping along and crying loudly. Kind Cikizwa quickly called an ambulance.
When the ambulance arrived, Elephant got the help he needed. His leg was bandaged and he was given an injection to help with the pain. As soon as Elephant started to feel better, he thanked Cikizwa for her kindness.Then he said, “Cikizwa, my child, never change who you are. Keep on respecting and loving everyone.”
But Gumbi and Cikizwa didn’t care. They became even closer. Gumbi taught Cikizwa how to swim and dive, and Cikizwa taught Gumbi how to scratch in the sand for food.Eventually Gumbi asked Cikizwa to marry him. Cikizwa agreed immediately. Together they decided to have their wedding the following Saturday at a place that they both loved near the river.
Their wedding day arrived. The sun was blazing hot. What a wonderful wedding it was!The animal choir sang beautifully. Iguanas, whales, crocodiles, seals, sharks, dolphins, sheep, cattle, dogs, antelopes, hares, porcupines, water snakes and other animals all sang together:“It is enjoyable here at the wedding of the fish. It is enjoyable here at the wedding of the chicken!”

It is raining.
Rain gives us water.
I enjoy playing outside.
But it is raining.
I enjoy playing out in the rain.

In a village on the slopes of Mount Kenya in East Africa,  a little girl worked in the fields with her mother. Her name was Wangari.
Wangari loved being outside. In her family's food garden she broke up the soil with her machete. She pressed tiny seeds into the warm earth.
Her favourite time of day was just after sunset. When it got too dark to see the plants,  Wangari knew it was time to go home. She would follow the narrow paths through the fields,  crossing rivers as she went.
Wangari was a clever child and couldn't wait to go to school. But her mother and father wanted her to stay and help them at home. When she was seven years old,  her big brother persuaded her parents to let her go to school.
She liked to learn! Wangari learnt more and more with every book she read. She did so well at school that she was invited to study in the United States of America. Wangari was excited! She wanted to know more about the world.
At the American university Wangari learnt many new things. She studied plants and how they grow. And she remembered how she grew: playing games with her brothers in the shade of the trees in the beautiful Kenyan forests.
The more she learnt,  the more she realised that she loved the people of Kenya. She wanted them to be happy and free. The more she learnt,  the more she remembered her African home.
When she had finished her studies,  she returned to Kenya. But her country had changed. Huge farms stretched across the land. Women had no wood to make cooking fires. The people were poor and the children were hungry.
Wangari knew what to do. She taught the women how to plant trees from seeds. The women sold the trees and used the money to look after their families. The women were very happy. Wangari had helped them to feel powerful and strong.
As time passed,  the new trees grew into forests,  and the rivers started flowing again. Wangari's message spread across Africa. Today,  millions of trees have grown from Wangari's seeds.
Wangari had worked hard. People all over the world took notice,  and gave her a famous prize. It is called the Nobel Peace Prize,  and she was the first African woman ever to receive it.
Wangari died in 2011,  but we can think of her every time we see a beautiful tree.
It is nearly break time at Siyafunda Primary School. The two spaza shop owners at the school are preparing lunch to sell to hungry children.
In Mr Motaung’s shop, the bread is cut and ready for making kotas. He carefully cuts out the soft middle of each quarter loaf. Then he puts polony and chips in the space inside. Motaung puts two spoonfuls of his wife’s homemade atchar in each kota. He likes to boast that his kotas have atchar inside and atchar on top!
In Mr Mkhize’s shop, the chips are nearly ready, but he is still cutting his bread for kotas. He is worried because things are not going well with his shop. “It started well,” thinks Mkhize. “But now I get fewer and fewer customers. At least I’m reducing some of my costs by cutting five kotas from a loaf.”
Jabu and Zodwa are buying lunch. Zodwa buys from Mr Mkhize. Jabu buys from Mr Motaung. He believes that Motaung’s kota has got more chips and atchar than Mkhize’s kota.
The queue at Mr Motaung’s shop is always longer. Zodwa waits for Jabu. Then the friends sit together in the shade to enjoy their kotas.
Zodwa notices something that makes her stare and frown. “What are you staring at?” asks Jabu. “Your kota! It looks bigger than mine,” says Zodwa.
They both look very closely at their kotas. Sure enough, Jabu’s is bigger. “Something is not right here,” says Zodwa. “I wonder if this is the reason Mr Mkhize’s shop is not busy anymore.” Jabu thinks for a while and then he replies, “Well, I heard that some kids saw Mkhize cutting his bread into five pieces for kotas!”
Nomsa overhears Jabu and Zodwa talking and she’s curious. She asks them what’s wrong with cutting the loaf into five pieces for kotas. Zodwa and Jabu reply together, “A kota is a quarter of a loaf!” Nomsa still looks confused, so Zodwa explains, “The loaf must be cut into four equal pieces. Otherwise, they are not quarters.”
Nomsa is cross because she also buys from Mr Mkhize. “So, he is stealing bread from us!” she says in a loud voice. Zodwa decides to go back to Mkhize’s shop to complain. She marches off, holding her kota up in the air. Nomsa hurries behind her. Jabu sighs and gets up to follow his friends.
Mr Mkhize is disappointed when he sees that the children aren’t new customers. “Oh, hello again kids,” he mutters, “how can I help you?” “Mr Mkhize, I asked you for a quarter and I paid you for a quarter. But this is not a quarter,” says Zodwa, pointing at her kota. “I want a quarter kota or my money back,” she adds firmly.
“Is it true Mr Mkhize? You’ve been cheating us!” cries Nomsa. A few children have followed them to the shop and are now listening to the fierce accusations. Mkhize waves his hands wildly. “What are you saying about me?” he protests. “I’m not like that! I want you to get out of my shop now!”
Then Zodwa says quietly, “We will tell everyone what you are doing. It will spread like wildfire throughout the school. You will have to close your shop. No one will come and buy from you!” Mr Mkhize looks at the three children standing in front of him. Then he looks at the growing crowd outside his shop.
“OK,” he says eventually, “I will give you your money back. “And also promise that you will cut each loaf into quarters for your kotas,” speaks up Jabu. Mr Mkhize promises that he will. Then he clears his throat and says loud enough for everyone to hear, “I also promise that I will add more atchar and more chips to my kotas.”
Mr Mkhize did indeed add extra chips and atchaar to his kotas. Soon more children were buying from him, and his shop started doing well. He was even able to hire someone to help him.
Now there is a healthy competition between Mr Mkhize and Mr Motaung, and everyone is happy.
Once long ago,  the birds had a meeting. They wanted a king.
The Eagle wanted to be king. The other birds said,  "Your call is too sad to be king." The Ostrich wanted to be king. The other birds said,  "You can't fly."
Peacock wanted to be king. The other birds said,  "You are too proud. You cannot be king." Owl wanted to be king. The other birds said,  "You sleep during the day. You cannot be king."
And so they did not get too far. Then one bird said,  "Who can fly the highest? That bird should be king." All the birds flew up up up into the sky.
Goose flew over the highest mountains in the world. Eagle flew into the blue above the mountains. But Vulture flew without stopping,  up towards the sun.
High above them,  the birds heard Vulture cry,  "I am the highest,  I am king!"
Vulture heard a tiny voice,  "Tink,  tink,  tink! I am the highest,  I am king." It was Ncede,  the Neddicky,  the smallest bird of all! He had held onto the feathers of Vulture as he flew up into the sky!
So Vulture flew down with the little bird still under his wing. The other birds were cross with Ncede. They waited for him,  ready to pluck out all his feathers.
But the quick little bird saw how angry they were,  and flew into an empty snake hole.
The birds told Owl to wait near the hole and catch him when he comes out. So Owl sat in front of the hole.
But the sun was warm and soon Owl was fast asleep. The little bird peeped out,  saw that Owl was asleep,  and z-zip,  away he went.
Owl was very ashamed that he had let the little bird escape. Now he only hunts at night. In the day,  he sleeps,  away from the sight of the other birds.
One day, Dog found eggs at the river
Dog put the ten eggs in his bag.
Dog looked after the eggs and kept them warm.
Crocodile asked Dog, “Have you seen my eggs?”
Crocodile asked all animals about her eggs.
Meanwhile, the eggs hatched one by one.
Dog could not give the young crocodiles enough food.
One day, Crocodile heard the rumbling bellies of young crocodiles!
Crocodile went inside and hit Dog with her tail.
Crocodile chased Dog down the road.
Dog stopped and said to Crocodile,“I am sorry!”
Crocodile forgave him and went to swim with her children.
Tom carries a tray of ripe bananas.
Tom goes to the market to sell bananas.
People at the market are buying fruit.
But no one is buying Tom's bananas. They prefer to buy fruit from women.
"In our community,  only women sell fruit," people say. "What kind of a man is this?" people ask.
But Tom does not give up. He calls,  "Buy my bananas! Buy my sweet ripe bananas!"
One woman picks up a bunch of bananas from the tray. She looks at the bananas carefully.
The woman buys the bananas.
More people come to the stall. They buy Tom's bananas and eat them.
Soon,  the tray is empty. Tom counts the money he earned.
Then Tom buys soap,  sugar,  and bread. He puts the things in his tray.
Tom balances the tray on his head and goes home.
The Winter cold had passed. Spring was coming to Nkanyezi’s village. Soon the villagers would gather to celebrate the new season. Nkanyezi looked forward to the Spring festival more than any other day in the year.
One warm morning, Nkanyezi overheard two village elders talking about the festival.“The people of Ndlovu have lost their spirit of celebration,” one sighed.“How can we have a Spring festival in a village that has forgotten how to celebrate?” asked another.
Nkanyezi was worried. “How will the sun shine again unless we sing to wake it from its winter slumber?” she asked herself.Nkanyezi thought for a long time.“I must find what we have lost,” she decided.“I must go in search of things that will bring back the spirit of celebration to my village.”
The elders gave Nkanyezi their blessing for the journey. They gave her a bag to carry the things she would find.Nkanyezi was afraid, but she believed she would succeed.
Nkanyezi walked all day. She hiked up a hill, and down into a valley. She sailed across the great river, and climbed between sharp rocks. She marched across the plains until she reached the shadow of the red mountains.
As night was closing in, Nkanyezi arrived at a village of patterns and colours as she had never seen before. She told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people. The mother of this tribe gave Nkanyezi a gift.She told the girl, “With love we give to you this paint to restore colour to a village that has gone dull.”Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the paint in her bag. Early the next morning she went on her way again, excited with this gift of colour.
Nkanyezi walked all day, through a vast forest of giant trees. As the sky became too dark for her to see, she heard the sound of beating drums. She hurried towards the drumming, feeling the spirit of dance coming to her tired feet
Nkanyezi found herself in the village of the Bhubezi. People were sitting around a fire, drumming and singing. She had never before heard such wonderful music.She told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people. The Bhubezi invited her to rest and stay the night.
In the morning the chief called on Nkanyezi.“My child,” he said, “here is a special drum. It plays a new song every time you beat it.” Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the drum in her bag. She went on her way again, delighted with this gift of music and dance.
On the third day of her journey, as she passed a field of fat cows, her nose started to tingle. An aroma tickled her taste buds and her mouth started to water. She followed the scent, and arrived in a village to find people standing over steaming pots of stew.This tribe was famous for its feasts and Nkanyezi had never before tasted such flavours. After she had eaten her fill, she told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people.
The next day, the council of cooks gave her a secret spice blend.“Our daughter,” they said, “with these spices, happy tummies are guaranteed! We give you the gift of good food.”Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the spices in her bag. She knew she had everything she needed.With new energy she started the long journey back to the village of Ndlovu.
When she arrived home the villagers gathered around her to hear of her adventures. She told them the tales of what she had seen, heard, and eaten. Then she opened her bag to share the gifts given. The people rejoiced to receive these treasures.Through the generosity of others and the courage of Nkanyezi, the villagers again found the colour, song and dance in their lives. And so the spirit of celebration was restored to the village of Ndlovu.
Long ago Hen and Eagle were friends. One day,  Eagle found Hen under a tree resting with her hopping bags. Hen was standing on one leg.
Eagle asked Hen,  "Where is your other leg?"
Hen told Eagle,  "The shopkeeper cut off my leg and gave me these groceries in return."
Eagle asked Hen whether he could do the same. He also wanted a bag of groceries. Hen agreed.
Eagle went to the shopkeeper and asked her to cut off one of his legs in exchange for groceries. The shopkeeper accepted.
The eagle hopped on one leg all the way home. But he was happy with the things the shopkeeper gave him.
When Eagle reached home,  he found Hen with both her legs.
Eagle was furious and chased Hen. But he never caught her. Instead,  Eagle always looks out for Hen's children. Whenever he catches one,  he eats it.
The day that we’re waiting for is coming. It’s going to be Chiefs versus Aces on this very field. Come and watch! Come with your vuvuzela!
“Chiefs, the cup must come to sleep at home,” said Coach. “I want us to work together as a team to defeat the Aces. We must attack cleverly, defend well, and pass to each other.”
Soon we were practising hard. “Pass the ball, pass it, Portia Modise!”“Defend, defend, Jomo!”“There it is, there it is, into the goals!”Po-o-o-o! Po-o-o-o! Po-o-o-o! sounded the vuvuzela.
“You played wonderfully, my beautiful Chiefs!You attacked cleverly, you defended well, and you passed to each other. You played as a real team!”
“High five to all of you! Well done!” said Coach.
We went home really tired, but the practice was good.“When is the real match, Coach?” we asked.
Finally the day came. “Halala Chiefs, halala! It’s going to be a good game. The cup is ours!” said Coach. Po-o-o-o-o! Po-o-o-o! Po-o-o-o-o! sounded the vuvuzela.
And then there was a surprise. “What beautiful kit!  Thank you, Coach. We play the best, and now we also look the best!”
Not here, not there.Where have you gone?
Not on the sofa.Not under the cot.
Not in the box.Not under my sister's frock.
Not under the pillow.Not in my bag.Sob, sob, where have you gone?
I have looked in every room, l have looked under every book.
I have looked under the chair,I have looked under the stool.Where have you gone?
Soon granny came back from her walk."Look what I found in the park."
"It can sway, it can bounce.It can spin, it can dangle.Ha-ha, hee-hee," said Granny with a giggle.
Oh Granny! Thank you so much!You have found my dear yo-yo!
"Yo-yo? What a funny name!What a funny toy!I want to play with it,It gives me so much joy!"
Giggle, giggle, giggling away,Granny played, with my little toy.For the rest of the day!

“I can’t lift you up, Shanu!” says Ammi. “You are too big!”
“You can’t walk to school alone, Shanu!” says Abbu. “You are too small!”
“You can’t sleep in the baby’s cot, Shanu!” says Dadu. “You are too big!”
“You can’t carry the baby to the park, Shanu!” says Dadi. “You are too small!”
Shanu is puzzled. Too big! Too small! How can she be too big andtoo small all at once?
Too big to wear her old pink frock.Too small to make dosas at the stove.
Too big to climb up on Dadu’s back?Too smallto carry the baby on hers?
“What am I the right size for?” Shanu wonders.
Ammi smiles and says, “Why, you are just big enough to go to big school.”
“And you are just small enough for me to carry you on my shoulders,” says Abbu.
“You are just big enough to take me for my morning walks,” says Dadu.
“And you are just small enough for me to tell stories to,” says Dadi.
“And you will always, always be the perfect size...for this!" all say, and give her a warm, wonderful hug.

Long time ago,  there were two young men who lost their cows. They looked for the cows until it was late.
As it got dark,  they saw a light in a house. They agreed to go and ask for a place to sleep.
They went to the house and knocked. The door opened and they went in. The young men didn't see anyone. But they heard a voice greeting them.
The voice said,  "I am a louse. Open the metal pot and have food. Open the earthenware pot and drink amahewu."
Then the louse put on its skin and went out.
The young men ate,  drank,  and gave thanks. Then they left the house.
As they left,  they had a bad thought. They said,  "No,  it couldn't have happened that we had food from a louse."  Eventually they agreed to go back and crush the louse.
They went back to the house and crushed the louse. Suddenly the louse was gone,  and the house disappeared! They found themselves outside in the open.
Chat was born blind. Her eyes had never seen her parents, or her brothers and sisters. She knew their faces by touch.
One day, Chat was strolling in the garden. She liked the sweet scent of flowers. She loved to touch their soft petals.
Chat wished she could see flowers, just once. "They are lovely," she said to herself.
Every day, Chat walked in the garden. She knew her way around. Today, she raised her head to the skies.
Suddenly, she heard thunder and lightning. "I need to hurry back to the house," Chat thought.
Rain began to fall. Chat slipped, lost her balance and fell. She hit her head on a stone.
When Chat woke up, there were people around her. "What happened?" she asked.
"You fell and bumped your head," her father said. "Thank God you are fine," said her mother.
"Daddy, mummy?" asked Chat. She also called the names of her brothers and sisters. "Please, get me a flower."Everyone was surprised.
Her sister returned with a flower. Chat held it gently. "It is so lovely," she said.
Her family looked at one another. "Chat, can you see the flower?" her mother asked.
Chat played with the flower in her hand. "You are all so beautiful, just like this flower," she smiled.
This is Lekishon. Lekishon is calling his dog.
Lekishon and his dog are going to graze the animals. The sun is hot.
Lekishon and his dog are thirsty and hungry.
They go to look for water.
Lekishon loses track of his cows.
Lekishon starts to cry.
He decides to go home with his dog.
The cows found the way home! Lekishon and his dog are very happy.
It is nearly break time at Siyafunda Primary School. The two spaza shop owners at the school are preparing lunch to sell to hungry children.
In Mr Motaung's shop,  the bread is cut and ready for making kotas. He carefully cuts out the soft middle of each quarter loaf. Then he puts polony and chips in the space inside. Motaung puts two spoonfuls of his wife's homemade atchar in each kota. He likes to boast that his kotas have atchar inside and atchar on top!
In Mr Mkhize's shop,  the chips are nearly ready,  but he is still cutting his bread for kotas. He is worried because things are not going well with his shop. "It started well," thinks Mkhize. "But now I get fewer and fewer customers. At least I'm reducing some of my costs by cutting five kotas from a loaf."
Jabu and Zodwa are buying lunch. Zodwa buys from Mr Mkhize. Jabu buys from Mr Motaung. He believes that Motaung's kota has got more chips and atchar than Mkhize's kota.
The queue at Mr Motaung's shop is always longer. Zodwa waits for Jabu. Then the friends sit together in the shade to enjoy their kotas.
Zodwa notices something that makes her stare and frown. "What are you staring at?" asks Jabu. "Your kota! It looks bigger than mine," says Zodwa.
They both look very closely at their kotas. Sure enough,  Jabu's is bigger. "Something is not right here," says Zodwa. "I wonder if this is the reason Mr Mkhize's shop is not busy anymore." Jabu thinks for a while and then he replies,  "Well,  I heard that some kids saw Mkhize cutting his bread into five pieces for kotas!"
Nomsa overhears Jabu and Zodwa talking and she's curious. She asks them what's wrong with cutting the loaf into five pieces for kotas. Zodwa and Jabu reply together,  "A kota is a quarter of a loaf!" Nomsa still looks confused,  so Zodwa explains,  "The loaf must be cut into four equal pieces. Otherwise,  they are not quarters."
Nomsa is cross because she also buys from Mr Mkhize. "So,  he is stealing bread from us!" she says in a loud voice. Zodwa decides to go back to Mkhize's shop to complain. She marches off,  holding her kota up in the air. Nomsa hurries behind her. Jabu sighs and gets up to follow his friends.
Mr Mkhize is disappointed when he sees that the children aren't new customers. "Oh,  hello again kids," he mutters,  "how can I help you?" "Mr Mkhize,  I asked you for a quarter and I paid you for a quarter. But this is not a quarter," says Zodwa,  pointing at her kota. "I want a quarter kota or my money back," she adds firmly.
"Is it true Mr Mkhize? You've been cheating us!" cries Nomsa. A few children have followed them to the shop and are now listening to the fierce accusations. Mkhize waves his hands wildly. "What are you saying about me?" he protests. "I'm not like that! I want you to get out of my shop now!"
Then Zodwa says quietly,  "We will tell everyone what you are doing. It will spread like wildfire throughout the school. You will have to close your shop. No one will come and buy from you!" Mr Mkhize looks at the three children standing in front of him. Then he looks at the growing crowd outside his shop.
"OK," he says eventually,  "I will give you your money back. "And also promise that you will cut each loaf into quarters for your kotas," speaks up Jabu. Mr Mkhize promises that he will. Then he clears his throat and says loud enough for everyone to hear,  "I also promise that I will add more atchar and more chips to my kotas."
Mr Mkhize did indeed add extra chips and atchaar to his kotas. Soon more children were buying from him,  and his shop started doing well. He was even able to hire someone to help him.
Now there is a healthy competition between Mr Mkhize and Mr Motaung,  and everyone is happy.
It is Rani's first day at school.Her mother is holding her hand and walking her to school."I am grown up now", Rani says to her mother. "Let go my hand, let go!"Her mother holds her hand even more tightly.
There were many children reaching the school already.Some children came by bus, by car, some by rickshaw, cycle.And some came by walking, just like Rani.
Rani and her mother reached the school gate, and her mother let go off her hand.Her mother stays at the gate. Now Rani has to go inside alone.There are many new faces all around her.
She takes one step, then another. She looks back, her mother was getting smaller and smaller as she walks away. She thinks. will my mother disappear and feels scared so runs back to her.She doesn't feel so grown up and holds her mother's hand and says "Don't go away".
All the students were inside by now, Rani was the only one outside.The teacher comes out and smiles at Rani. Rani smiles back at her teacher and let go off her mother's hand. Her mother says, "Rani, I will be here when you come out."Her mother waves to her and goes away.
Rani went inside. She was now happy, her mother will be there after school!

As it got dark, they saw a light in a house. They agreed to go and ask for a place to sleep.
They went to the house and knocked. The door opened and they went in. The young men didn't see anyone. But they heard a voice greeting them.
The voice said, "I am a louse*. Open the metal pot and have food. Open the earthenware pot and drink amahewu**."* A small parasitic insect** A Southern African drink
Then the louse put on its skin and went out.
The young men ate, drank, and gave thanks. Then they left the house.
As they left, they had a bad thought. They said, "No, it couldn't have happened that we had food from a louse." Eventually they agreed to go back and crush the louse.

There was a dark jungle.
It was a big dark jungle. There were lots of trees and a narrow path. Many animals and birds lived here.
One day,  all the animals came together. "Did you hear?" asked Tota,  the parrot. "Yes," said Hirni,  the deer. "What?" asked Darpok,  the rabbit. "We have a school in the jungle," answered Zhoola,  the monkey. Mota,  the elephant wondered,  "Hmph?" Lamboo,  the giraffe said,  "Oh,  good!" Dheema,  the snail squealed,  "Hurry,  let's go!"
Tota,  the parrot flew ahead. Zhoola,  the monkey jumped from tree to tree. Poorakha,  the python slithered fast. "Here!" shouted Tota. "Can you read?" "It is upside down,  I think," said Zhoola hanging by the branch. Poorakha concluded,  "Hisssss. No one can read."
Soon,  all the other friends joined them. Lamboo looked over the tree. "No one here," he said. Zhoola repeated,  "No one here." Tota proposed,  "Look carefully!" Pilloo,  the little bear declared,  "I found a room!"
"I found a swing",  announced Dheema. "What are these blocks?" Darpok wanted to know. "What is this?" was Zhoola's question. Poorakha explained,  "I believe,  this is a pencil."
Moto and Lamboo found a classroom. They called the others,  "Look,  what is this?" Everyone came with school bags. They began shouting,  "Teacher! Teacher! Where is our teacher?" No one knew.
Then they heard a roar. They heard a loud roar. They heard a louder roar. Poorakha was worried. Dheema was scared. Tota hid behind the board. Lamboo and Zhoola were puzzled.
Who is this? "Hup!" said Zhoola the monkey. No one spoke. They all looked at the teacher. Up and down carefully. Then they looked at one another.
The teacher turned to write on the black board. "Jump," said Zhoola. "Fly! Said Tota. Thump,  thump,  thump ran Mota. "Run,  run run fast," screamed Dheema. "Bhagoooo," they all shouted together. When the teacher turned. There was no one in the class."
For the children in every country of Africa
One day, my big sister  Zinhle had this idea. "I am going to make masks for those people in the community who don't have masks!" she said. "That's a good idea! Let's tell Mama and Baba when they get home!" I said.
When Mama and Baba arrived home, we told them about Zinhle's idea. "That's a good idea, my child!" Baba said, and Mama agreed. "I will ask our church members to give us cloth to make the masks. Let's ask Gogo to help with sewing."
The next day, the church ladies dropped off colourful cloth and elastic at our house.Zinhle left some cloth and elastic in a bag outside Gogo's door, with a note asking Gogo to help.
Zinhle started stitching masks and Wandile and I watched her. Zinhle is very good at stitching. She stitched many masks. Wandile and I counted the masks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, then, 100!
Zinhle and Gogo made enough masks for everyone in the community! We helped them!Mama and Baba were so proud.
The next day, Baba and Mama were not working. They decided to give out the masks to anyone who needed a mask. Zinhle carried Mama's hand sanitiser and sprayed people's hands. "Remember to wash your mask every day," said Mama.
Now when Zinhle goes to get water, everyone is wearing masks. Everyone looks and feels safer.
Later, Mama asked, "Children, what do we do after we touch anything?""We wash our hands with soap and water!" Wandile said. "Or use sanitiser," I added.Mama smiled, "And what do we wear when we go out?" We all shouted, "Our masks!"
1. Wash your hands with water.2. Use soap to wash your hands.3. Wash for 20 seconds or slowly count from 1 to 20.4. Rinse your hands with water.5. Dry your hands with clean towel or tissue.6. Now your hands are clean!
When Rohan woke up, he began to play with Jimmy, his dog.“There’s something you should do first!” said Riya, his big sister. “BRUSH YOUR TEETH!”WOOF!
“I don’t want to brush my teeth! Jimmy doesn’t brush his teeth!”“Animals take care of their teeth too, but in other ways! We must brush our teeth to keep germs away!”“Germs?”“Germs are very tiny creatures that you cannot see. If you don’t brush properly, they stay in your mouth and hurt you!”“Ouch!”“YES! That’s why we must take good care of our teeth by brushing twice a day - morning and night!”“But brushing is no fun!”“I’ll tell you a secret, Rohan! Psst…”  Rohan smiled.
Mummy called out, “It’s breakfast time!” “There’s something we should do first!” said Riya. “WASH OUR HANDS!”WOOF!
“But Jimmy never washes his hands!”Riya laughed, “He doesn’t use his hands or paws to eat like we do! We must wash our hands with soap to get rid of germs.”“Are germs on our hands too?”“Germs are EVERYWHERE!”WOOF!“Aaaah-chhhooo!” Riya covered her mouth with her hands as she sneezed.“Don't do that! My teacher says that we should sneeze into our sleeve, not our hands!" said Rohan.“Why?”“Because when we sneeze into our hands, germs stick to them. If we don’t wash our hands, we spread germs and make others sick!”
“Here comes Germy!” Riya shouted, chasing Rohan and waving herdirty hands.  “EEEEEEEK!”WOOF!
Later Riya showed Rohan the proper way to wash hands. “Wet your hands and turn off the tap. Then rub in some soap on the palms, the back of the hands and between the fingers. Scrub hands for twenty seconds! Now, it’s time to rinse off and dry!”“But that’s a long time!”“Remember my secret?”Rohan smiled.
When they came back home after playing, Riya nudged Rohan, “There’s something we should do first!”Mummy teased, “Play some more?”“TAKE A BATH!”“Mummy, don’t you know that germs are everywhere? We can’t see them, but they stick to our skin and clothes!”“That’s why we must bathe every day…” “…to get rid of them!”
"Start by getting yourself wet,” said Mummy. “Then apply soap all over!” Riya and Rohan giggled as Mummy’s ticklish fingers soaped them up.“Then it’s time to rinse off!”“And dry with a clean towel!”“SUPERCLEAN!”WOOF! “It’s Jimmy’s turn next!”
“Do you want to listen to a story?” asked Papa.
“There’s something we should do first!” reminded Riya. “Tidy UP!”Rohan yawned. “Do we have to?”“Remember you couldn’t find your ball the other day? Putting things away in the proper place makes it easy to find them later!”“And keeps our house neat!” “You both are so smart!” said Papa proudly. “Bedtime!”“Papa! There’s something we should do first!” said Riya, pulling Rohan along.“Make the germs disappear with our magic secret!”Rohan nodded.
A few minutes later, Mummy and Papa heard a familiar tune. “So that’s your secret!” said Papa. “Humming a song to make brushing fun!”“And while washing our hands too!”“That’s a great idea!” said Mummy.WOOF!Rohan and Riya enjoy taking care of themselves. Do you? They make up a game with the germs and guess who wins?
Germs say, yucky, mucky and dirty is FUN!I say, I brush and wash and I know I have won!Germs say, never bathe, it’s a waste of time!I say, smelling nice with soap is so fine.Naughty germ says don’t pick up your things, The house looks better that way.I say, I tidy up because I like my thingsThat is a good way to end my day!And I feel better in every wayI feel better in every way! I FEEL BETTER IN EVERY WAY!!!!!Now make up your secret song and hum it when you have to do boring things!
A rat has entered the house. Grandma was the first to see it."Rat!" He jumped on the sofa as he shouted.The little pillows in it all fell down.
"Where?" Dad climbed out the window as he heard that.The curtains all fell down as he pulled."There!" Mom jumped on the table shouting. The plates in it fell down and broke.
﻿"Catch the mouse," Mithun looked at the cat and shouted.The cat saw the mouse, then ran away and crawled under the bed."Rat!" Mithun ran after the cat shouting.
"I will chase away that rat," said the mother boldly.He took a broom and stabbed here and there."You're a rat," Dad shouted. Mom saw the rat and he too hid under the cot.
"I know how to get rid of this rat!" Grandma jumped down from the sofa. He rolled up a newspaper and stabbed it here and there.
"Rat!" Said Dad. He climbed a little further up the window."Left with you!"Grandma looked at the mouse. He too ran and hid under the bed.
"Damn!" Said Dad. He could not climb above it.Slowly descended from the window. He hid under the bed without catching the mouse's eye!
“Rat! Rat! ” That everyone shouted together.Papa woke up to that noise.She sat up in bed and rubbed her eyes gently.Um, of course, yes, I know this, why it's something known in advance.
It had two eyes, four legs, and a long tail."Rat!" Papa clapped his hands happily.Papa looked at the rat and the rat started to run. Papa also ran backwards!
Climb on the sofa, jump out the window, jump on the table, roll on the pillows ...
... slipped between the curtains, stumbled on the plates, and ran out the door!
One special Friday Yusuf ’s father gets dressed before a flicker of light brightens the sky. He pulls on his heavy weather-proof jacket and the green woollen cap that covers his ears. He waves his boy goodbye. Yusuf ’s eyes brighten when Papa says, “Today is the day I will catch a fish and bring a gift home for you.”
A fish and a gift? Oh, what will it be? Papa cycles down to Muizenberg Beach. Squeak squeak go the wheels all the way to Surfer’s Corner.Gulls circle the sky. “Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” they cry. “What will you bring back for Yusuf?”Papa rings his bell. “Wait and see what it will be!”
The fishermen watch the sun rise. They check their nets. They check their oars. They listen to the wind. They drag their boats down to the water. Yusuf ’s grandfather, Oupa Salie was a treknet fisherman. Before him his father, Oupagrootjie Ridwaan, knew the sea too.
The boat rides into the waves. Papa’s arms stretch to the oar. His leg braces against the side. His neck strains, his back muscles ripple.Papa sings as he works: “Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don’t you stop.”
All day long Yusuf looks at the sky. It is bright and clear and windless. A fish and a gift! What will Papa bring home from the sea? Sometimes he brings a beautiful shell. Sometimes he brings a jewel green bottle rinsed by the waves.
Some days Yusuf ’s father brings a story. Like the time they found sea turtles on the sand, hundreds washed up in a storm.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cried the gulls. “What will you do to help the turtles?”Papa said, “We saved those turtles, I tell you straight. We sent them back to the ocean, every last one.”
Always Papa brings a song. He sings the song while he pulls the oars. He sings the song while he pulls the nets. He sings the song as he winds the ropes. He sings the song as he cycles home. “Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don’t you stop.”
Ouma Safiya wants a nice fat yellowtail for her supper. Mother wants a new dress.“Don’t be silly,” says Ouma. “You’ll be lucky if they catch even a tiny crab. More likely it will be fish tail Friday. There’s not so many fish left in the sea.”Yusuf holds Ouma’s hand. They cross the road at the bathing cabins.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cry the gulls perched on the bright rooftops. “What is for supper?”
Last year the fishermen fought with the surfers. Angry fists and shouting words.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cried the gulls.“There’s enough sea for everybody,” said Yusuf ’s father. He showed them the fishing licence that had been Oupa Salie’s. “Waves for all. Water for free.”
Ouma Safiya watches through her binoculars, her fingers curled in curiosity. The shark siren sounds. Swimmers run back to the sand and grab their towels. Surfers rush to the shore, carrying their boards under their arms. Under the showers they strip off their wetsuits.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cry the gulls. “What will Yusuf ’s father bring from the ocean?”
Yusuf’s father and uncle and cousins heave and pull. A little shark has been caught. It twists and thrashes in the waves. Yusuf’s father untangles the nets, singing to the shark: “Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don’t you stop.”When the shark at last is free it streaks back into the waves, leaving only one fat yellowtail in the net. Ouma Safiya will be pleased.
The men pull the boat in and coil up the cables. A hard white triangle catches Papa’s finger.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cry the gulls. “What did you bring back for Yusuf?”As the sun goes down, Papa answers the gulls. “A lucky shark tooth for my boy.”At home Yusuf holds his gift up to the stars.

On Sunday, Jimmy Zogba scored the winning goal.
On Monday, the Cool Cat Crew strutted by.
“Hey, Rafiki, where’s your zebra hair? Your hair’s so plain, like you don’t care.”
“Hey, Rafiki, where’s your fake tattoo? Your skin’s so boring. You are too.”
“Hey, Rafiki, where’s your bling? Your teeth are wonky, that’s the thing.”
That day, Rafiki walked home slowly.
“Auntie, can I have zebra hair?” “I can’t cut you zebra hair. Actually, I wouldn’t dare.”
“My skin’s so boring, Sisi. Can you make a fake tattoo?”“You don’t need one to look like you.”
“Mkhulu, I wish I had some bling.” “Bling, my child, don’t mean a thing.”
The next weekend, Santi Ramires scored the winning goal.
On Monday, the Cool Cat Crew strutted by.
“Hey, Rafiki! Looking fine!”
Rafiki shrugged. “I look like me; this style is mine.”
Once upon a time, Jackal was walking around the bush. He was very hungry. He saw Crow flying above the trees with a big piece of cheese in his mouth.
"Hmmm that cheese looks delicious! I must find a way to get it," thought Jackal. "Oh, I have a plan!" said Jackal to himself while wiping his mouth quickly. He did not want Crow to notice that he was hungry.
Crow had been flying the whole morning. He was tired. He decided to sit on a branch of a tree. Jackal sat down under the tree where Crow was sitting.
Jackal called with a huge smile, "Hello Crow! You're looking very good today. Your feathers look glossy and healthy. You must be taking very good care of yourself."
Crow was very flattered to hear this. Crow always thought he was the strongest and most beautiful of all the other birds.
"I hear you also have the most beautiful singing voice of all the other birds. Won't you sing a song for me this morning?"
Crow was so flattered that he stretched his wings and prepared to sing for Jackal. He pushed his chest out and let out a loud pitched sound.
As Crow started singing the cheese fell to the ground, right in front of Jackal. Crow stopped and looked down. Jackal grabbed the piece of cheese and ran into the bush. Crow was left angry and hungry.

There was only one bus in Ebei's village. It was big and blue. It was very noisy.
“Tomorrow we will go to town,” said Ebei's mother. “We will buy your school uniform.”
Ebei was very excited. They would travel in the big blue bus. He could not sleep that night.
When his mother came to wake him, Ebei was already dressed.
Ebei and his mother walked to the bus stop. They waited for the big blue bus. But the bus did not come.
Other people arrived at the bus stop. They complained because the bus was late. “Where is the bus?” they asked.
Ebei was worried. “We will not be able to go to town,” he thought. “I will not be able to get my uniform.”
Some people gave up and went home. Ebei cried. He did not want to go. “We will wait a bit longer,” said his mother.
Suddenly, they heard a noise. They saw dust in the air. The bus was coming!
But this bus was not blue. It was not big. It was red and small. The people did not want to get in this bus.
“Get in! Get in!” shouted the driver. “We are very late today,” he called.
Ebei and his mother got in first. Soon everyone else got in the small red bus.
Ebei looked out the window. He saw more people at the bus stop.
Even more people were running to catch the bus. But they were too late. The red bus was full. It left for town.
“Where is the big blue bus?” asked Ebei's mother. “It broke down,” replied the driver. “We are fixing it. It will come tomorrow.”
Ebei did not care about the colour of the bus. He did not care about the size. This bus was going to town!

It was the unusually hot summer holidays. Nomfundo and her family were visiting their relatives in Durban. Inside the house it was as hot as the sun itself.After lunch, Nomfundo took her book and went to cool down at the forest near the house.
The shade of the two tallest trees gave her enough shade to stay there for a while.There was nothing but the sound of birds. How peaceful!
Suddenly, Nomfundo felt something hit her head. "What could that be?"She saw a tiny book next to her. She thought it was her imagination. "I only brought one book here, where is this one coming from?"She looked up the tree, around the tree but did not see anyone.
Then she saw the tiniest animal looking down at her.It was a dormouse, a rare and very shy kind of mouse made completely of fur.They are only found in Asia, Europe and Africa.
Nomfundo looked up again, and this time she saw the dormouse's nose peeping through the branches."Hello, I'm Nomfundo. Have you lost something?" Nomfundo asked the dormouse.The small furry rodent squealed in fright and hid behind a leaf.Then the dormouse moved forward again and spoke with a timid voice, "Hello, I'm Bushy. I lost my book."
"I was reading when suddenly a wind blew up," explained Bushy."I will return your book to you," said Nomfundo."How? You are down there and I am up here," replied Bushy.But Nomfundo was already running home! She had an idea.
Nomfundo went to get the helium balloons that her little brother got for his birthday. She ran back to the forest with the balloons and tied them on a string, around her waist.She floated up the tree."Welcome to the forest canopy," squealed an excited Bushy.
Nomfundo gave the tiny book to Bushy. As a token of friendship, Nomfundo took off one of her ribbons and presented it to Bushy.Bushy tied the ribbon on her tail and the two were friends from that moment."Come, let's explore the forest canopy," said Bushy.
"We must go quietly here, the fruit bat is asleep," whispered Bushy.Bats search for food at night and sleep during the day. They sleep high up in the trees to stay safe from predators.
Next, they came across a colourful frog."Hello Benji, how are you?" Bushy asked the frog.Benji was surprised to see a human in the tree tops! Nomfundo was surprised to see a frog up there!Tree frogs live most of their lives in trees.
Suddenly, Nomfundo heard a loud crying sound! It was a bird calling the dormouse."There's a human! Why is she here?" squawked the Hornbill. "Nomfundo is my friend from the world on the ground," replied Bushy."Please don't be afraid," said Nomfundo, holding out her hand.
The animals welcomed Nomfundo and shared their food with her. But the day is coming to an end, and Nomfundo must leave her friends.She will return to the ground feeling very happy.What a good day she had!
“We have milk, eggs,bread  and vegetables in the fridge,” says Ma.“I’ll cook dinner!” says Pa.“Pa, can you make fried rice?” asks Tara. “Fried rice,” Madhav echoes.
As soon as Tara, Madhav, Ma and Pa enter the house, they know that something is wrong. Very wrong."Chee! What’s that smell?” cries Tara.“A MONSTER!” yells Madhav.
It is hot, dark and stinky. The whole house smells!Where is the smell coming from?
Ma opens the fridge. Everyone covers their noses and mouths.“Hmm, it’s warm inside and the light is off,” says Ma, sticking her arm into the fridge. “What happened?” asks Tara. "The fridge stopped working some time ago," Pa explains. "Without the cold air, everything spoiled,” says Ma, glumly.“Has the milk gone bad?” asks Tara.“Yes, can you smell how sour it is?” asks Ma.“Milk needs to be kept cold to stay fresh,” says Pa.
“Has the bread gone bad?” asks Tara.“Yes, do you see that green stuff? That’s mould,” says Pa, “It grows on the bread.”“Fuzzy,” says Madhav, curiously.“Don’t touch it,” says Pa. “You’ll fall sick if you eat it.”
“Have the vegetables gone bad too?” asks Tara, sadly.“Yes, they’re rotten,” says Ma. “We can’t eat them.”
Invisible MonstersTara and Madhav thought there was an invisible monster in their house. While there was no monster to be found, they were right about there being something invisible!When food goes ‘bad’—meaning it cannot be eaten by human beings—it’s because something invisible has begun to eat the food. These invisible beings are called microbes.Microbes aren’t totally invisible: they’re just very, very, very tiny (tinier than the tiniest insect you’ve ever seen). You need a machine called a microscope to be able to see them. They look something like this.
On Sunday,  Jimmy Zogba scored the winning goal.
On Monday,  the Cool Cat Crew strutted by.
"Hey, Rafiki, where's your zebra hair? Your hair's so plain, like you don't care."
"Hey, Rafiki, where's your fake tattoo? Your skin's so boring. You are too."
"Hey, Rafiki, where's your bling? Your teeth are wonky,  that's the thing."
That day, Rafiki walked home slowly.
"Auntie, can I have zebra hair?" "I can't cut you zebra hair. Actually,  I wouldn't dare."
"My skin's so boring, Sisi. Can you make a fake tattoo?" "You don't need one to look like you."
"Mkhulu, I wish I had some bling." "Bling,  my child,  don't mean a thing."
The next weekend, Santi Ramires scored the winning goal.
On Monday, the Cool Cat Crew strutted by. "Hey, Rafiki! Looking fine!"
Rafiki shrugged. "I look like me; this style is mine."

﻿A fawn was zooming in a race through the forest.
He ran past the rabbit with ease.
He even flew past the big-big elephant.
He jumped over the stream feeling refreshed by the cold water.
He ran past the crumbling wall.
In excitement, he didn't pay attention to where he was running and missed the large boulder. He stumbled and fell.
﻿He got hurt very badly in his leg and couldn't get up.
The monkey massaged his leg. Tears flowed from the fawn's eyes. He couldn't bear the pain.
Brother Bear picked him up and called his mother.
His mother came. She said, “Look, we’ll beat up this bad boulder!”
The fawn said, “Oh, don’t do that or he will also get hurt and start crying.” His mother laughed. So did he.

Once upon a time, the Eagle and the Hen were great friends. They helped one another in times of need.
They played together. They played with the other animals like the tortoise.
They had a great herd of cows,  sheep, goats and camels. They used to graze together in the plains while playing.
One day hen went to borrow a razor blade from the eagle to shave her children. Eagle gave hen his razor without questioning.
Hen shaved her children neatly. However she forgot to keep the razor safely.
When the eagle came for his razor, hen could not find it. She scratched all over in vain. Eagle became angry and began eating hens chicks.
Hen ran for dear life and went to stay with the humans. Till today hens live with humans and eagles feed on the chickens.
When the last school bell rang, all the children laughed and screamed with joy.                                                    All, except Akku. Akku was ANGRY!
"Akku! Akku! Look at the pretty sunflowers!" said Appa, as they rode   through a field."Oh no! They’re TOO YELLOW! They’re making my eyes hurt!" said Akku.
Akku! Akku! Look! Look at all the monkeys!" said Appa, pointing at the roof of their house.                              "oh no!" said Akku. Go AWAY!
"Here, drink some buttermilk," said Appa. "It’ll cool you down.""NO!" said Akku. "I DON’T WANT ANY!""Try a sip, at least?""OKAY! FINE!" said Akku, and tried a sip.It wasn’t all that bad.She had another sip.  And another.In no time, the glass was empty.
"Would you like a vada?" asked Appa.  "NO" said Akku."Just one little bite?""Okay, FINE!" said Akku, and took a bite. It  was quite good.She took another bite.And another.In no time, the plate was empty.
"Good girl," said Appa. "Now will you tell me why you’re so angry?"    "NO!" said Akku."Was it something I did?""NO!""Was it something Amma did?""NO!""Did something happened in school today?"     "MAYBE!"        "Oho."
"Would you like to draw it?" asked Appa. "Here’s a nice sheet of paper and some crayons."                                                                                                                                     "Okay, FINE!" said Akku.
Akku drew a brick… "This is the BRICK that I tripped over this morning," said Akku.                   "You’re right. That is a  brick!" said Appa.
And Akku drew a boy…"This is Bikku, The BOY who laughed at me when I fell down!" said Akku.                 "You’re right," said Appa. "He shouldn’t have laughed at you."
And Akku drew an idli…    "This is my idli," said Akku. "It fell out of my lunch box when I tripped over the BRICK!"
And Akku drew a crow…                                              "This is the CROW that flew off with my idli," said Akku.                              "The crow must have been very hungry," said Appa.
And Akku drew her teacher…"This is my teacher, Amala Miss," said Akku."She helped me up when I fell down. And then she hugged me.""That’s nice of her," said Appa."And then she patted my back and said, you would be fine. I DON’T like to be hugged and patted."Are you alright now?" I’m okay now."     "That’s good."
"See how well you draw, Akku?" said Appa."You’re a real artist! Will you draw something for Amma too?""Okay!" said Akku, and      started drawing some more. "This is a little white mouse… and this is a boat…and this is a coconut tree…"
"And this is a sunflower…and this is your cycle, Appa… and this is a dog…and this is a frog…"In no time, Akku had forgotten all about the BRICK that made her trip and fall. And about the BOY who laughed at her. And about the IDLI-CROW.And Akku even forgot about being ANGRY.
10 Things to Do If You Feel ANGRY like Akku:1. Laugh loudly and jump around with your arms in the air!2. Slowly – very, very slowly – breathe in, and breathe out!3. Drink some water! Or buttermilk!4. Eat a piece of fruit! Or a vada!5. Tell a grown-up about how you’re feeling!6. Write about how you’re feeling!7. Draw it out! Paint it!8. Play with a pile of clay!9. Make up a song about your anger! Sing it aloud!10. Do the happy dance!
Once upon a time, Lion was the strongest and most feared of all the animals. He would catch other animals and eat them. But one morning while he was looking for his breakfast, he got caught in a hunter's trap.
Lion gave his loudest roar. He pulled and pulled to free himself from the trap. The trap got tighter and tighter around his leg every time he pulled. Lion grew tired and he felt more pain in his leg. Finally, he gave up.
Days went past as Lion lay baking in the sun. He was hungry and thirsty and there was nobody to save him. He became weaker and weaker. "I am going to die of hunger and thirst in this trap," he thought to himself.
One morning, Lion heard a sound coming from the nearby bushes. He listened and looked closer. He saw Warthog walking with his family, talking and laughing. The warthogs were going to the river to drink water and play in the mud before the sun got too hot.
"Warthog! Please help me! Warthog!" cried Lion. "Please set me free from this trap," he pleaded. "Never," said Warthog. "You are a cruel animal. You will eat me and my family for breakfast if I set you free." Lion replied, "I promise I would never do such a bad thing. We will be friends if you can set me free."
Warthog felt sorry for Lion. "I do not like seeing you in such pain, thirsty and dying from hunger," he said. So he pulled at the trap with his long strong tusks and released Lion. Warthog saved his new friend.
"Thank you for saving my life," said Lion. "I must go to my family now,  good bye." Warthog replied, "Go well my friend." He was happy that Lion was his friend. "My family will never have to run from Lion again," he thought.
Lion walked away limping and weak. He was also very hungry. Then he saw Warthog's children playing in the mud. "Today is my lucky day," said Lion with his mouth watering.
"Warthog, my new friend," called Lion. "I have been caught in the trap for days without food. I am too weak to hunt. Please would you give one of your children to me for breakfast?" Warthog was shocked. "I saved you from the trap and now you want to eat my children?"
"I am very sorry my friend," said Lion, "but I am starving. I might be weak right now,  but I am still stronger than you." Lion opened his mouth and showed his strong teeth. "If you do not give me one of your children, I will take one for myself," he roared.
Warthog knew that he did not have the speed or the strength of Lion. He would never be able to protect his children in a fight. "All right," agreed Warthog. "I will give you one of my children. But first I want you to show me how you were caught in the trap. In case I have to save another lion from such a trap."
Lion imagined the wonderful taste of young warthog in his mouth. He could hardly wait. He went back to the trap and put his foot inside, to show his friend how he was trapped.
"Ouch!" Lion roared. Warthog had closed the trap on Lion's foot. "Aha! I got you," said Warthog. "You will stay in that trap hungry and thirsty again. See if your strong teeth and sharp claws can help you now."
"Run! Run! Run away!" Warthog's wife shouted to the children at the top of her voice. "Raise your tails when you are running so that your father can see you," she called. The babies ran as fast as they could through the bushes.
"Warthog please help me!" begged Lion again. He was in pain from the trap. "I will do anything for you if you save me," he cried. "No way, liar! I will never believe you again," shouted Warthog. "I will also warn other animals not to save you because you are very sly."
Warthog saw his children running in a row with their mother. Their tails were lifted up for him to see them. He rushed to his family and they all escaped safely. To this day, warthogs always run with their tails lifted up to see that everyone is safe.
Come back, cat! Play with me.
Sit in your basket. Stay right here!
Come back, cat! That’s way too high.
Come back, cat! Don’t go outside.
Come back, cat! That’s not yours.
Come back, cat. What have you got?
Come back, cat.  That’s not your friend!
Hello, cat! Are you back?
Stay in your basket. It’s nap time now.
Cat?
I wake up at night feeling thirsty. I want to get some water. I start looking for my slippers under the bed.
Oh my God! There is a tiger under my bed.
Now what should I do?
Should I call Ma? What if the tiger roars?
Should I just go back to sleep? But I am not sleepy any more.
Then someone turns on the light. Ma is standing at the door.
“What happened dear?Did you call me?” asks Ma.
I point towards the tiger. Ma bends and pulls the tiger out from under the bed!
Hey, this is no tiger. This is my thick yellow and black sweater. Its buttons shine like a tiger's eyes.
I got scared for nothing!Ma gets me some water.
Now I will sleep. And dream about real tigers in a jungle!
"Lineup class! Let’s go to the park," Laila Miss says.Allthe students hold hands, chattering away. Kavya stands by herself.Asthey start walking, Laila Miss asks, "Does anyone know what acaterpillar becomes when it grows up?"  Kavya’sstomach flips. She knows the answer! Should she say something?
Kavyaand her family have just moved to Bengaluru from her village.Theylive at the construction site where her parents work.It’shard living in a half-finished house. The air smells of smoke, andthe honking traffic makes it hard to sleep. The towering buildings,zooming cars, and busy people make her feel very, very small.
Kavyahas been coming to school for a week. She still hasn’t spoken toanyone.Whatif they make fun of her accent? Or tease her because she’s neverbeen to school before?  Kavyatakes a deep breath and raises her hand. In a noisy city likeBengaluru, she can’t be quiet forever.
"Whencaterpillars grow up, they become butterflies," Kavya says."That’sright!" Laila Miss says."Caterpillarsare only caterpillars for a few weeks," Kavya says. "They spendthat whole time eating leaves." "Theymust get very big," says Mary, her classmate."Theydo!""After they eat and eat and eat, caterpillars weave cocoons on the sides of plants. They go inside, where they grow and change," says Kavya.
"That’scorrect," Laila Miss says. "They stay in the cocoons for abouttwo weeks. When they come out, they are butterflies.""Look,we’re at the park!" Mary says. Kavya gasps. The park is covered in butterflies!
Bluebutterflies the colour of rivers. Yellow butterflies the colour ofsunlight.Orangebutterflies the colour of ripe chikoos. Black-and-white butterfliesthe colours of starry skies.These are all the colours Kavya misses from her village.She feels her heart flutter.
"Every year, butterflies travel thousands of kilometres to come to this park. They are here formore food, better weather, and a safe placeto lay eggs," Laila Miss says.  "This journey is calledmigration."
"Don’tthey get tired, flapping their wings for so long?" a classmateasks."Ifthere is a strong wind, they don’t have to flap their wings,"Kavya says. "They spread their wings and glide.""Thatmust be bumpy," Mary whispers to Kavya.
Kavyathinks about the bus ride to Bengaluru – squeezed in between allthe luggage. Bumping and tumbling for hours and hours and hours. Isthat how a butterfly feels on the wind?
"Whenbutterflies migrate, they follow rivers. To stay healthy, they stopalong the riverbank to soak up minerals with their feet. It’scalled mud-puddling," Laila Miss says."Mud-puddling?"Mary says. "That sounds like fun."Maryand Kavya smile at each other. "Itis," Kavya says. "But now puddles are hard to find."InKavya’s village, men in trucks take sand away from the river. Theweather gets hotter and hotter. There is less and less rain.
Last year, the river went dry. The butterfliesdidn’t have enough water to mud-puddle. Kavya’s family didn’thave enough water to farm.  That’swhy they moved to Bengaluru.
"Youknow a lot about butterflies, Kavya," says Laila Miss."That’sbecause they are my favourite insects," says Kavya."Whydo you love butterflies so much, Kavya?" asks Mary.Howcan Kavya choose just one thing? Sheloves how their bodies are sometimes spotted and sometimes striped.How they drink nectar with their long noses. How they spread pollen,which makes more flowers grow.
"Theyfly far, but wherever they land, they make new friends," Kavyasays, squeezing Mary’s hand. "They’re very small, but they’realso very brave.""Justlike you," Laila Miss says.Kavyasmiles a smile as wide as a butterfly’s wings.
Makea Butterfly Rest StationButterfliesin India migrate twice a year. Their journey is getting harder andharder because our forests and rivers are disappearing. Butterfliesdon’t have enough places to rest. Many get tired along the way. Oneway to help butterflies is to make safe spaces for them to stop andhave a good meal.
Here’show to make a butterfly rest station:Find	a flat vessel with high edges, like a thali or	a	plate.Butterflies	love bright colours. Paint the vessel red, yellow, or orange.Fill	the vessel with butterfly food. It’s easy to make! Mix four cups	of water with one cup of sugar.
Add pieces of over-ripe fruit. Butterflies love bananas, guavas, mangoes, papayas, and oranges.Keep the vessel out on your veranda, windowsill, or anywhere outside.Clean and refill the vessel every two to three days.To attract even more butterflies, plant flowers that butterflies love. You can plant verbena, geraniums, dahlias, or sunflowers. You don’t need a lot of space – you can plant them in pots on the ground, or keep them on windowsills.

In a far away town, there was a smart and expensive shoe shop. This is the town in which I was born.
Many people came to this shoe shop, but few could afford to buy the fancy footwear. One day, a rich man with big feet visited the shop.
He put his money on the shop counter. Then, with his hands in his pockets, he walked up and down looking at the shoes.
As he came closer, I held my breath and froze.He stretched out his hands and grabbed me.He sat down and put me on his feet.
He had huge feet, and the smell nearly suffocated me! I was packed into a box.We drove home, and he put me in a cupboard.
He wore me every day.I made him smart and he walked with confidence. I had a hard life. He was always lazy about washing his feet.
In return, sometimes I pinched him, making him limp.Eventually, I became old and broken, with scars and cracks.He put me outside, next to the rubbish bin.
Someone picked me up for recycling, and took me to a leather workshop.At the workshop I was made into a shiny new wallet!I began a new life.
I have many friends.....
My some friends are elder than me and....
some are younger than me......

And some are such who doesn't have legs.....
And some are such who even fly.....
Ohhhhhh Even books are my friends......
But do you know who is my best friend.... Who??? Who???? Who????
My MOM!!!!!
Tulsa wishes she could visit a forest. Her teacher reads stories about tigers to the class. She loves to hear about forests and animals.
One day, her wish comes true! Khare Chacha, a senior forest official, invites Tulsa and her friends to visit a forest called Kanha Tiger Reserve. Tulsa and her friends can’t stop grinning. They will go to the forest for a whole day and a whole night!
It takes four hours by bus from the school to the forest. As soon as Tulsa gets down from the bus, a strong hand shakes her hand and then ruffles her hair. “Welcome to Kanha!” It is Khare Chacha.
Tulsa and her friends Rani, Mithu, and Dipti stay close to one another. “Sniff the air. It smells of trees and leaves!” says Mithu.“The air is clean like it has been washed with soap!” adds Rani.
It's almost sunset now. Khare Chacha and other forest officials tell them about the forest they will visit tomorrow. They play the sounds of animals and birds for the girls to hear and recognise.
PIAON! PIAON! “It’s a peacock!”OOW! OOW!“I know! It’s a barking deer.”KEEE! KEE!“That is the sound of crickets!”Next day, Tulsa wakes up at five in the morning. Brrr! It’s cold! Everyone bundles up in warm clothes. One by one, they get into the bus. “All around us there is tall grass covered in a thick blanket of fog,” Ranveer Uncle, the forest guide, tells them. Tulsa can feel the cold and pure air in her mouth. It tastes like mint leaves.
“Shhh!” Ranveer Uncle whispers. “There are two jackals right next to our bus.” Everyone listens carefully. They hear the rustling sound of the tall grass. Dried leaves crush under their feet, as the jackals run lightly into the dense forest.
Ranveer Uncle whispers again. “A big deer called sambar is standing on the left side of the road. The deer is brown and has big stem-like horns called antlers on its head.” Everyone focuses to their left. HAUNNNNK! HAUNNNK!  The sambar runs off. "Sounds like a very big horn!” says Tulsa. All the girls laugh.
Soon, the air becomes even cooler. “We are near a river now,” Ranveer Uncle says. Tulsa can hear the gurgling of the water. So many birds are calling from the trees.
FHWEEE! FHWEEE!“That one is whistling!” says Rashmi.“Yes Rashmi, that is the call of a thrush,” says Ranveer Uncle.KEEECH! KEECH!“And that screeching you hear is the call of the jungle babbler.”
Soft leaves fall from above. Baby monkeys are showering them with leaves! Tulsa picks up a leaf that falls on her. It smells fresh and pure, just like the forest.
The bus starts moving uphill. “Hold this creeper. See how it feels like a strong rope? The leaves are like cotton!” Everyone takes turns to hold the creeper. “This is the mahul,” says Ranveer Uncle. “The leaves are used to make small bowls.”
PIAONN! PIAONN!“Peacock to your right!” Ranveer Uncle is excited.
“Is he dancing?” asks Tulsa.“Yes!” Uncle says. “His feathers are shining in the winter sun and are sparking like gemstones.” “Beautiful,” says Tulsa.
By now everyone is very hungry. They stop at the forest camp for breakfast. There, Khare Chacha announces a surprise. “Some of our camp elephants are here. They won’t mind if you touch them gently.” Everyone starts squealing in delight. Soon Tulsa is led to the elephant, Tara.
The guide places her hand on Tara’s prickly stomach. Whoomp! Tulsa hears the sound of Tara’s feet moving. Tulsa can feel the powerful muscles under her hand. Trumpeting softly, Tara places her trunk in Tulsa’s hand, looking for food. Tulsa can’t stop smiling, as she feels the wet trunk. It's time to go back. On the way, they pass a gaur. “The gaur is chewing grass. The body is black but the bottoms of the legs are white. It looks like the gaur is wearing socks,” says Ranveer Uncle. Everyone laughs. Suddenly, the air is split by a call, deep and loud.
AUHN! The call comes again.“The tiger is very far,” explains Ranveer Uncle. “But he has probably seen you and wants you to know that.”
Sighing with happiness, Tulsa and her friends head out of the park. There are so many ways to experience the forest! They can't wait to come back to Kanha Tiger Reserve.
This is a real storyIn January 2017, the Last Wilderness Foundation in association with the Kanha Forest Department conducted a camp for 23 visually impaired students from the Ananya Manav Sai Samiti, Jabalpur. The students were taken on a safari and nature trail using their fabulous sensory skills to enjoy the forest.

Once upon a time, the animals decided to have a party. But it was not for all of them. It was only for the animals that had horns.
The rabbit was getting ready for the party. But then he found out that the party was not for everyone. It was just for animals  with horns.
The rabbit went somewhere and got some horns. Then he put them on his head and went to the party.
During the party the rabbit ate and drank and danced.
This made him tired and he fell down in the sun. But while the rabbit was sleeping, the horns fell off!
Then all the animals discovered that the rabbit was not the kind of animal they wanted. So they pulled his ears till they got bigger and bigger.
Then they ran away. And that's the reason why rabbits have big ears!
'Wov! What a lovely raincoat!' Mannu danced happily holding the shining red raincoat that his parents had bought for him.'Mamma, may I wear the raincoat now?' Manu asked his mother.Mamma said, 'No, my child. You can wear it when it rains. It should start raining soon. But as of now I don't see any signs of the rain.'
But, Monday was a bright sunny day, full of golden sunshine.Mannu looked out of the window every now and then and asked his mother,'Mamma, will it rain today?'Mamma  peeped out of the window and said, ' I don't think it will rain today. You cannot wear the raincoat today. People will laugh at you, if you do.'
On Tuesday also Mannu kept looking at the sky. And the raincoat was kept right next to him, ready to be used. But the sky was a nice blue and as bright as it was on Monday.Mannu was disappointed,'Mamma, when will I be able to use the raincoat?''There is just a single cloud in the sky today, and that too a white one. I don't think you will get a chance to wear the raincoat today.'Mamma said.
Wednesday again was a very hot sunny day.Mannu was getting worried, 'Mamma, why is it not raining yet?'He tried to put the raincoat on at home. But had to immediately take it off because he felt too hot in it.Mamma, in her eagerness to comfort him said, 'I think it will rain soon, probably by afternoon.'
On Thursday, there was the school picnic. Mannu was eager to show off the raincoat to his school buddies.'Mamma, shall I carry the raincoat to the picnic. What if it rains there?' Mannu asked.'Don't, my pet. It will not rain today. See those white clouds? And they are also so far away.' Mamma tried to comfort him.
And... at last  on Friday, the sky looked quite dark with black clouds. Mannu kept the raincoat ready at hand.'Mamma, it will rain today, right mamma?' Mannu asked excitedly. The peacock also seemed to think so and started dancing. The tortoise came out of it's hiding and looked up at the sky hoping perhaps to feel cooler after the hot summer.'I think so. Today the sky is full of black clouds.' Mamma smiled at Mannu's excitement and was happy for him.
On the Saturday morning there was a loud thunder.  And also lightening.'Mamma, it that not lightening? Now it will surely rain, right Mamma?' asked Manu.He ran out on the lawns and saw that a frog and a tortoise also had come out of their hiding.
And.. tip...tap...tip...tap... came down the raindrops!Mannu, loved the rains...raincoat or no raincoat.'Oh, it is raining; it is raining.' Thus shouting  Mannu ran out of the house and started  jumping and dancing in the rain. And he had the company of the frog who also seemed to be  waiting for the rains.
'Wait Mannu, wait.' Mamma ran after him with his raincoat in her hand. 'You forgot your raincoat!'But Mannu was very happy getting drenched in rains. The raincoat which he was holding close to himself all this time was all forgotten.
Once upon a time, there was a crocodile living at a river with her young ones.
The crocodile taught her young ones not to trust humans. This is because humans have brains.
One day a certain man crossed the river.
The man met the crocodile in the middle of the river and she attacked him.
Just as the crocodile was about to kill him, she remembered her father's words. He always told her that people have brains.
The man promised the crocodile that he could bring her human brains. So the crocodile released him.
The crocodile and her young ones are still waiting on the riverbank to receive those brains.
Crocodiles are angry to this day because they never received the brains that were promised to them.
Chicken and Millipede were very close friends. In some ways they were very similar; they both loved sport and were very competitive. But in other ways they were very different. Millipede loved to joke around and make people laugh. She was able to do many things at once, juggling tasks with her many legs. Chicken was more serious. She was good at taking others under her wing and making them feel safe and cared for. But she also had a terrible temper!
One day they decided to play a friendly game of soccer. Chicken was a fast runner and an excellent dribbler. She also had a powerful kick and could score goals from far away. But Millipede had something Chicken could never compete with - hundreds of legs! Millipede ran circles around poor Chicken, scoring goal after goal. Chicken got angrier and angrier. Watch out, Millipede!
"Let's have a penalty shoot-out," said Chicken, hoping that this would prevent Millipede from using her legs to dribble around her."Sure thing!" said Millipede confidently.First Millipede was goal keeper. Chicken scored only one goal. Then it was Chicken's turn to defend the goal.
Millipede kicked the ball and scored. Millipede juggled the ball and scored. Millipede headed the ball and scored. Millipede tapped the ball and scored.Chicken grew angrier by the minute. "This is unfair," she thought, "Millipede should only be able to use two of her legs. She is cheating!"While Chicken was busy thinking her angry thoughts, Millipede slyly kicked the ball around her and through the goalposts. Millipede scored five goals!
Chicken was furious that she had lost."I want a rematch," she demanded, "and this time you can only use two of your legs!"Millipede started laughing because her friend was making such a fuss. "What a sore loser you are!" she said, "Why didn't you use your wings to flap the ball into the goal, or your feathers to blow it over my head? You lost fair and square, my friend!"
"You see," said Millipede, "soccer is really all about strategy. You need to use your brain and have a plan.""Are you telling me I don't have any brains?" shrieked Chicken. "How dare you!"But before Millipede could answer, Chicken opened up her beak and swallowed her.
As Chicken was walking home, she met Mother Millipede. Usually Chicken loved to see her friend's mother. Mother Millipede told wonderful stories and baked the most delicious leaf cakes. But today Chicken marched right on, hoping Mother Millipede would not recognize her."Hello dear," Mother Millipede called, “Have you seen my child?” Chicken didn't say anything. Mother Millipede was worried. "Chicken is acting very strangely!" she thought.
Then Mother Millipede heard a tiny voice. “Help me, Mom!” cried the voice. Mother Millipede looked  around and listened carefully. "Where is that voice coming from?" she asked. "Have you got someone inside your stomach, Chicken?"Chicken looked around sheepishly. She didn't know what to do."Who have you eaten?" asked Mother Millipede. "Don't tell me you've eaten my precious baby!"
Mother Millipede shouted, “Use your special power my child!”Millipedes can make a badsmell and a terrible taste. Chicken began to feel ill."I don't feel so well," she moaned. "I need to go home and lie in my bed."
Chicken burped. Then she swallowed and spat. Then she sneezed and coughed.  Millipede tasted disgusting!Meanwhile, Mother Millipede stood beside her, cheering. "Well done, my darling!" she shouted, "Keep on working that special magic! You'll be out in no time."
Chicken coughed and coughed until Millipede came out. "Hooray!" shouted Millipede, "I'm free! I escaped!"Mother Millipede was relieved to see her child alive and well. "Come quickly," she whispered, and her and Millipede crawled quickly away. They climbed and climbed until they reached the top of a tall tree where they could hide.
From that time on, all chickens and millipedes have been enemies.
﻿I lost my bat.    I cant find it anywhere.
I searched behind the door.    It's not there.
I checked on the shelf.   couldn't find it there.
﻿Searched under the cot.    It's not there either.
﻿checked in the box.     There is no trace of it.
Searched the whole loft.     couldn't find it there too.
﻿I searched for it everywhere.     couldn't find it anywhere.      There, It's in my sister's hand.
Shanti and Arun were good friends. They had so much fun together.They shared secrets in class. They ran races on the way home.She was always cheerful.
One day, Shanti came into the classroom slowly. Her head was bent. She looked sad. “Did someone scold you?” asked Arun.Shanti shook her head. She sat down and did not look up. She did not answer ‘Present!’ when Sona Miss called her name. Sona Miss called again, louder this time, “Shanti Kumar!” Shanti raised her hand.
“Do you have a sore throat?” her teacher asked her. Shanti shook her head.Her cheeks were red and it looked like she had a fever.“Are you feeling okay?” Sona Miss asked.Shanti nodded, still not daring to look up.
“Why does Shanti look so sad?”“Is your little brother okay?”“Is your puppy okay?”“Is your grandmother okay?”Shanti kept nodding her head to each of her friends. But she did not look up.
Arun wanted to make her smile. He had an idea! He took out something from his bag.As he ran to show it to Shanti, it slipped out of his hands. Shanti saw something flying towards her and she grabbed it.
It was a BIG, green, rubber frog!Shanti's eyes flew open. Then she opened her mouth to laugh.THEN Arun and her friends saw why she had not smiled or talked all day!Four of her front teeth had gone missing!
I have a new baby brother at home now, but all he does is cry, cry, cry... I can't talk to Mama, because he cries so loudly. When I try to talk to Papa, even on the phone, we  can't hear each other because Baby is crying, crying, crying...
When I come home from school, Mama is so tired. Sometimes when I try telling her about my football game or math homework, she drops off to sleep mid-way.
Papa's cousin has come to stay with us to help with Baby. But Laila Aunty, who used to play cricket in the garden with me before, is now too busy. And suddenly very strict. 'You can't touch Baby till you wash your hands with soap,' she tells me all the time.
When Baby is NOT crying, he looks so cute. But nobody lets me go close to him. 'Baby's sleeping. Don't disturb him,' they say. Or, 'You are too small to carry him. Wait till you're older.' I wonder how old I need to be before they let me play with my own brother.
It's not just Mama who's tired. Before Baby arrived, Ajji used to listen to all my news. And tell me lots and lots of stories. But one day I found her snoring at four o'clock in the evening. 'I'm tired, son...ask Thatha to read you a story today,' she said, half-asleep.
I found Thatha in front of the TV, fast asleep. I looked for Mama, but she too had slept off  beside Baby. I suddenly felt so lonely. Every one was asleep. And when they woke up, would have no time for me. Just when I turned to leave, I heard some soft laughter...
Baby was awake! And he was smiling up at me. With everyone asleep, there was no one to check if my hands were clean. Or remind me that I was not old enough to carry Baby. So I picked him up carefully and took him to my room. He lay on me for a little while...
...touching my face with his little fingers and making funny noises. Then he slept off again. Baby had not cried one bit with me. When Mama woke up a hour later, looking fresh and relaxed, she promised to read me my favourite story at night.
Now, nobody ever says, 'You're not old enough to do this...or that with Baby,' because when Baby is with me, he never cries.
One harsh winter, many people in the land were sick. Ma Monikazi’s cheeks burned. Sweat dripped from her body. She wanted to hold the icy grass to her face to cool down. Under her blanket she held her belly and sang to the baby inside her: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”Her stomach growled when the baby’s powerful kicks woke her at night. She ate the leftover meat in the cooking pot, hungry for life.
One bright night the moon was bigger, fatter and pinker than ever. Her breath came fast. The baby was ready. The aunties in the birthing room rubbed her back and warmed the water. When Monikazi held her beautiful daughter in her arms, she knew she was a special girl, a fighter.What a blessing! Her name is Nontsikelelo. She will be the mother of all blessings.
Nontsikelelo was beautiful and strong with crinkling black button eyes. She loved her older brother, Mcengi. He made her laugh and so the laughter spread. She loved to eat meat before she had teeth. Her favourite aunt always kept a little portion on the side of her plate for Ntsiki. Mcengi chased the chickens that scratched in the garden where Ma Monikazi grew spinach and squash to feed her family. Ntsiki ran after him as her legs grew strong.Ma Monikazi had another baby boy, Velaphi, and another, Qudalele. Finally another sister, Nomyaleko. Little Ntsiki folded napkins and washed the baby clothes. She swept the house and fed the fire. She picked up her baby brother when he cried and tickled him till he laughed.She taught them to sing: “Be strong, little one. Winter is gone. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”
Qingqiwe, her grandfather, raised horses. His favourite was Shishi, a glossy black mare. As soon as Ntsiki was old enough, he hoisted her on to the saddle in front of him. His strong arms reached around her. He laced the reins through her fingers.He taught her to talk softly to Shishi, to groom her with a hard bristled brush. When she stroked its glossy coat, Albertina whispered, “You are the most beautiful creature. Thank you for letting me ride on your back.”Her father, Bonilizwe, came home from the mines at Christmas. Ntsiki pulled herself up onto Shishi’s broad back. She rode out to meet him at the bus stop. Ntsiki sat tall and straight. Her knees held firm. She handled the reins with gentle fingers.How proud Bonilizwe was of his daughter. The biggest smile Ntsiki had ever seen covered her father’s face.
On her sixth birthday she went to school. “You must choose an English name,” said the Presbyterian teacher, but Ntsiki liked her own name. “Why do I need a new name?” she asked. The teacher scowled and read the names aloud: “Adah, Agnes, Albertina, Anna.” What did they mean? Ntsiki liked the long name best. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had rhythm. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had bounce. Albertina was a name you didn’t mess with.When her cousin married a handsome man from a nearby town, Albertina was chosen as an umkhapi. The maid of honour! Weeks before the wedding, she stitched her isikhakha, the short traditional skirt, and threaded bright beads onto her amatikiti. Her mother gave her the white flag and said, “You have a big job, my blessing.”At the bend in the road Albertina waved the flag, then turned Shishi back, leading everybody from miles around to the ceremony. People would gossip if she made a mistake, but the guests lined the road. They ululated and sang. They threw down flowers for the horse and the girl.
Her mother was often sick and needed Albertina to look after the home. In her last year of primary school, Albertina was the oldest pupil in the school. She was chosen to be the head girl and wore her badge with pride.Her best friend, Betty, told her about a competition, saying, “You must apply, my clever friend.” “What is the prize?” asked Albertina, growing curious.“A scholarship to high school!” said Betty. “You must apply. You’ll win it, for sure.”
Albertina studied until the candle burned down. She practised sums. She practised spelling. She sharpened her pencils and gave her shoes an extra shine. Next morning she passed Shishi in her paddock. The horse whinnied and stamped the ground.The test began. Albertina’s fingers shook. The sums were tricky. Her mouth went dry. Her hand cramped on her pencil but she continued. “Well done, Albertina!” said her teacher at the end. The important official arrived and called the top two students to the stage. “Well done to Albertina for full marks,” he said, “but you are too old. The scholarship goes to…”Albertina tried not to cry. “That’s unfair,” shouted Betty, hopping with fury. “That wasn’t in the rules!” How would Albertina go to high school now? She dragged her feet all the way home.The teacher wrote to the newspaper about the unfair decision. Brother Joe at the Catholic Mission station read the story over his breakfast. He cracked his boiled egg with an extra flourish. He pushed the newspaper across the table to Father Bernard. He didn’t like the story one bit either.
Soon enough there was a scholarship for Albertina. Mariazell near Matatiele was a long way from Xolobe, but the whole village erupted. Their home girl was off to high school. She would make them proud. They threw a party like no other. The women brewed the sorghum beer and lit the fires. They slaughtered chickens and stirred up pots of meat. Albertina smiled till her face ached.She packed her brown suitcase and polished her shoes again. Before setting off on the bus to Matatiele, she said goodbye to Shishi. Albertina brushed her coat and stroked her wiry mane. She whispered all her questions into the horse’s silky ear: What if I get lost? Will I make new friends? Will I still be clever so far from home? Shishi whinnied and stamped the ground.
School days started well before sunrise. The girls washed quickly in the cold water and swept the dormitories before Mass. The milky porridge was never quite enough; the stew not as tasty as Aunty’s back home. But Albertina studied hard. She played netball on sunny afternoons.In her school holidays Albertina worked at the mission station. She rubbed and scrubbed against the zinc washboard. She boiled sheets in copper tubs, then wound them through the wringer. She hoed and tilled the school garden but missed her family. Who was telling her brothers and sisters funny stories? Who wiped their eyes when they cried? Who tickled them until they laughed?Albertina loved the nuns who taught her. Could she become a holy sister? “But nuns earn no salary,” said Father Bernard. “Perhaps you should become a nurse? You’ll be paid while you study.”
Albertina took a train to Johannesburg. She bought a smart white uniform, new navy shoes and a shiny red fountain pen. Sick people came all day to the hospital. She cleaned their wounds with careful fingers. She held the old people gently. When the babies cried, she sang: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!Some nights Albertina worked till dawn. She looked out the window and thought of her family. Were the children hungry? Did they go to school? Who was riding Shishi? She remembered the dark green spinach. She missed the scent of the earth. There was no vegetable garden here. There was nowhere for a horse.Albertina never went to parties. She saved every shilling. On her days off she learned to play tennis. Whoosh! Plop! She whacked the ball across the net. Always, she wished for a little more money to send home.
Walter Sisulu was a brave and clever man who dreamed of freedom for South Africa. His big smile captured Albertina’s eye. They walked together down the city streets. Her delicate hand rested on his arm. Walter wanted Albertina to be the mother of his children.Bright ribbons decorated the Bantu Men’s Social Centre on their wedding day. Albertina’s long-sleeved dress had a swirling train of lace. Many friends blessed their special day. Albertina planted flowers in her little garden. Within a year, Max was born. Albertina had become a mother. One day people would call her the mother of the nation.Max had his mother’s black button eyes and his father’s round chin. He was the hope for their future. Albertina wanted to fight for a new South Africa, so that Max could be free. When he cried, she sang: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”
Police came in the middle of the night, banging on the door. Albertina scolded the men who messed up her house. “How rude you are!” she said, “trampling mud inside my home.”In the morning Albertina’s favourite flowers lay crushed beneath their footprints. She remembered chasing the chickens from her vegetable garden back in Xolobe and set about replanting her garden. The earth, she knew, would recover.She would support her husband who kept many secrets and hid from the police.
She joined the women and worked to organise a march to Pretoria. The women refused to carry a pass. They sang, “Wathint’ abafazi; wathint’ imbokodo! You strike a woman; you strike a rock!”Many hard years followed after Walter’s arrest. He was jailed on Robben Island for 26 years. Albertina, also, was sent to jail many times. Often she was scared. Often she was lonely.But even on the darkest nights, she could see a sliver of moon through the window in her cell. She sang the song that Ma Monikazi sang before she was born: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”
Oscar was a special young octopus. He lived with his fish friends in the ocean. His fish friends were not always nice to him.
Oscar's fish friends often teased him."Oscar is as blue as a bluebottle!"
The fish taunted when Oscar swam around the kelp."Oscar, you are as brown as the klingy kelp!"
Oscar lay on the sandy sea bottom and the fish jeered:"He is a white as foamy sea froth!"
"Oscar you are as green as slippery sea slime! Hahahahahahaha!"The fish would laugh at  his colour changes! Poor Oscar felt sad.
A pajama shark came along. All the fish panicked and flicked with fear. Oscar jettisoned into the jagged rocks and turned himself black to blend into the cracks!
The fish flicked and flurried all over while the shark snipped and snapped at them. But Oscar was safe hiding in the rocks. Nobody could see him!
Once the shark had left, the fish gathered. Oscar came out of his hiding place and the fish chorused: "Wow Oscar! We never knew that your ability to camouflage would come in handy! We are so sorry for teasing you."Oscar felt so proud. He finally knew what his special ability meant!
The next time the shark visited, Oscar helped shelter the fish in the slimy green seaweed, protecting them from the shark by turning green.
The shark was none the wiser and just swam away. After all, it just looked like nothing but green seaweed! Oscar felt so happy that he could help his friends.

Once, a rabbit thought to itself, "I have been eating raw carrots so far...
"Let me cook and eat it. "
"How do I cook?"
"Let me ask for help in this house"
But, there was a dog that started barking . He also chased the rabbit.
"Oh dear! What do I do now?" thought the rabbit.
He kept the carrots in the sun. The carrots didn't  cook.
He cooked the carrots in the fire. The carrots became too bitter!
"How do I cook and eat this? " Thought the rabbit furiously to himself.
He found a tortoise shell.
He gathered twigs.
He also found stones!
The rabbit lit the stove.
He also invited his friends to eat.
Everybody enjoyed eating the finely cooked carrots!

Today is my first day of school. Mother held my hand and walking with me. "Now I have grown up," I say. "Come...come!"Mother held my hand tightly.
There are many children near the school.Some come by bus. Some come by car.Some come by rickshaw. Some come by bicycle and some come on foot, like me.
We reached to the gate.Mother left my hand.She stopped on gate. I have to go alone inside.Many unknown faces are around me.
I moved one step. I moved another step.  I looked behind. As I move forward, mother looks smaller. Would she disappeared? I ran to her. I don't think I've grown up. I hold her hand and say, "don't go".
All had gone inside. Only I was outside. Teacher came outside.She smiles after looking me. I also smiles. Mother says," Rani I will meet you here when you come out". I leave her hand. She waive her hand.
I ran inside. Mother would meet there on leave.
One special Friday Yusuf ’s father gets dressed before a flicker of light brightens the sky. He pulls on his heavy weather-proof jacket and the green woollen cap that covers his ears. He waves his boy goodbye. Yusuf ’s eyes brighten when Papa says, “Today is the day I will catch a fish and bring a gift home for you.”
A fish and a gift? Oh, what will it be? Papa cycles down to Muizenberg Beach. Squeak squeak go the wheels all the way to Surfer’s Corner.Gulls circle the sky. “Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” they cry. “What will you bring back for Yusuf?”Papa rings his bell. “Wait and see what it will be!”
The fishermen watch the sun rise. They check their nets. They check their oars. They listen to the wind. They drag their boats down to the water. Yusuf ’s grandfather, Oupa Salie was a treknet fisherman. Before him his father, Oupagrootjie Ridwaan, knew the sea too.
The boat rides into the waves. Papa’s arms stretch to the oar. His leg braces against the side. His neck strains, his back muscles ripple.Papa sings as he works: “Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don’t you stop.”
All day long Yusuf looks at the sky. It is bright and clear and windless. A fish and a gift! What will Papa bring home from the sea? Sometimes he brings a beautiful shell. Sometimes he brings a jewel green bottle rinsed by the waves.
Some days Yusuf ’s father brings a story. Like the time they found sea turtles on the sand, hundreds washed up in a storm.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cried the gulls. “What will you do to help the turtles?”Papa said, “We saved those turtles, I tell you straight. We sent them back to the ocean, every last one.”
Always Papa brings a song. He sings the song while he pulls the oars. He sings the song while he pulls the nets. He sings the song as he winds the ropes. He sings the song as he cycles home. “Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don’t you stop.”
Ouma Safiya wants a nice fat yellowtail for her supper. Mother wants a new dress.“Don’t be silly,” says Ouma. “You’ll be lucky if they catch even a tiny crab. More likely it will be fish tail Friday. There’s not so many fish left in the sea.”Yusuf holds Ouma’s hand. They cross the road at the bathing cabins.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cry the gulls perched on the bright rooftops. “What is for supper?”
Last year the fishermen fought with the surfers. Angry fists and shouting words.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cried the gulls.“There’s enough sea for everybody,” said Yusuf ’s father. He showed them the fishing licence that had been Oupa Salie’s. “Waves for all. Water for free.”
Ouma Safiya watches through her binoculars, her fingers curled in curiosity. The shark siren sounds. Swimmers run back to the sand and grab their towels. Surfers rush to the shore, carrying their boards under their arms. Under the showers they strip off their wetsuits.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cry the gulls. “What will Yusuf ’s father bring from the ocean?”
Yusuf’s father and uncle and cousins heave and pull. A little shark has been caught. It twists and thrashes in the waves. Yusuf’s father untangles the nets, singing to the shark: “Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don’t you stop.”When the shark at last is free it streaks back into the waves, leaving only one fat yellowtail in the net. Ouma Safiya will be pleased.
The men pull the boat in and coil up the cables. A hard white triangle catches Papa’s finger.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cry the gulls. “What did you bring back for Yusuf?”As the sun goes down, Papa answers the gulls. “A lucky shark tooth for my boy.”At home Yusuf holds his gift up to the stars.
