A rat has entered the house. Grandma was the first to see it."Rat!" He jumped on the sofa as he shouted.The little pillows in it all fell down.
"Where?" Dad climbed out the window as he heard that.The curtains all fell down as he pulled."There!" Mom jumped on the table shouting. The plates in it fell down and broke.
﻿"Catch the mouse," Mithun looked at the cat and shouted.The cat saw the mouse, then ran away and crawled under the bed."Rat!" Mithun ran after the cat shouting.
"I will chase away that rat," said the mother boldly.He took a broom and stabbed here and there."You're a rat," Dad shouted. Mom saw the rat and he too hid under the cot.
"I know how to get rid of this rat!" Grandma jumped down from the sofa. He rolled up a newspaper and stabbed it here and there.
"Rat!" Said Dad. He climbed a little further up the window."Left with you!"Grandma looked at the mouse. He too ran and hid under the bed.
"Damn!" Said Dad. He could not climb above it.Slowly descended from the window. He hid under the bed without catching the mouse's eye!
“Rat! Rat! ” That everyone shouted together.Papa woke up to that noise.She sat up in bed and rubbed her eyes gently.Um, of course, yes, I know this, why it's something known in advance.
It had two eyes, four legs, and a long tail."Rat!" Papa clapped his hands happily.Papa looked at the rat and the rat started to run. Papa also ran backwards!
Climb on the sofa, jump out the window, jump on the table, roll on the pillows ...
... slipped between the curtains, stumbled on the plates, and ran out the door!
Not here, not there.Where have you gone?
Not on the sofa.Not under the cot.
Not in the box.Not under my sister's frock.
Not under the pillow.Not in my bag.Sob, sob, where have you gone?
I have looked in every room, l have looked under every book.
I have looked under the chair,I have looked under the stool.Where have you gone?

a warm morning , Raja woke up with a yawn and said to himself "lets go for fishing now".
While going to the pond,he met Ram,his best friend and invited him to go to the pond together.
Sita saw them going for fishing. The boys asked her if she wanted to come with them.
Sita thought for a moment and said "don't do this,fishes will die when separated by water"
They didn't paid attention to her and continued on their way to the pond.
Raja and Ram sat near the pond and saw to fishes jumping in water,one was a thin and second a fat one.
There came a third fish. They didn't saw any fish bigger than this! Sita said" This fish is even bigger than my father's foot!"
Raja and Ram took their fishing rods with and struggled for the fish.Ram said"its mine!"Raja said"no,its mine!"
Raja pulled the rod, Ram pulled stronger.
BOOM! They fell down as their rods broke.
Do you know why ?Any guesses ?fished tied their strings together!
Hamisi needs a new school uniform. His dad takes him to the market.
Hamisi sees a boywearing a beautifulshirt. "That is a very fine shirt," thinks Hamisi.
"Dad, I wish I had a shirt like that boy," says Hamisi.
"Look, there are those beautiful shirts," says Hamisi. "Dad, please buy one for me."
"Hamisi, I have to buy your uniform," says dad.
"I do not have enough money for that shirt," says dad.
Hamisi's dad buys the uniform. He is surprised when he gets the change. He has enough money left over to buy a shirt!
It is Hamisi's lucky day! Which shirt will he choose?
"Lineup class! Let’s go to the park," Laila Miss says.Allthe students hold hands, chattering away. Kavya stands by herself.Asthey start walking, Laila Miss asks, "Does anyone know what acaterpillar becomes when it grows up?"  Kavya’sstomach flips. She knows the answer! Should she say something?
Kavyaand her family have just moved to Bengaluru from her village.Theylive at the construction site where her parents work.It’shard living in a half-finished house. The air smells of smoke, andthe honking traffic makes it hard to sleep. The towering buildings,zooming cars, and busy people make her feel very, very small.
Kavyahas been coming to school for a week. She still hasn’t spoken toanyone.Whatif they make fun of her accent? Or tease her because she’s neverbeen to school before?  Kavyatakes a deep breath and raises her hand. In a noisy city likeBengaluru, she can’t be quiet forever.
"Whencaterpillars grow up, they become butterflies," Kavya says."That’sright!" Laila Miss says."Caterpillarsare only caterpillars for a few weeks," Kavya says. "They spendthat whole time eating leaves." "Theymust get very big," says Mary, her classmate."Theydo!""After they eat and eat and eat, caterpillars weave cocoons on the sides of plants. They go inside, where they grow and change," says Kavya.
"That’scorrect," Laila Miss says. "They stay in the cocoons for abouttwo weeks. When they come out, they are butterflies.""Look,we’re at the park!" Mary says. Kavya gasps. The park is covered in butterflies!
Bluebutterflies the colour of rivers. Yellow butterflies the colour ofsunlight.Orangebutterflies the colour of ripe chikoos. Black-and-white butterfliesthe colours of starry skies.These are all the colours Kavya misses from her village.She feels her heart flutter.
"Every year, butterflies travel thousands of kilometres to come to this park. They are here formore food, better weather, and a safe placeto lay eggs," Laila Miss says.  "This journey is calledmigration."
"Don’tthey get tired, flapping their wings for so long?" a classmateasks."Ifthere is a strong wind, they don’t have to flap their wings,"Kavya says. "They spread their wings and glide.""Thatmust be bumpy," Mary whispers to Kavya.
Kavyathinks about the bus ride to Bengaluru – squeezed in between allthe luggage. Bumping and tumbling for hours and hours and hours. Isthat how a butterfly feels on the wind?
"Whenbutterflies migrate, they follow rivers. To stay healthy, they stopalong the riverbank to soak up minerals with their feet. It’scalled mud-puddling," Laila Miss says."Mud-puddling?"Mary says. "That sounds like fun."Maryand Kavya smile at each other. "Itis," Kavya says. "But now puddles are hard to find."InKavya’s village, men in trucks take sand away from the river. Theweather gets hotter and hotter. There is less and less rain.
Last year, the river went dry. The butterfliesdidn’t have enough water to mud-puddle. Kavya’s family didn’thave enough water to farm.  That’swhy they moved to Bengaluru.
"Youknow a lot about butterflies, Kavya," says Laila Miss."That’sbecause they are my favourite insects," says Kavya."Whydo you love butterflies so much, Kavya?" asks Mary.Howcan Kavya choose just one thing? Sheloves how their bodies are sometimes spotted and sometimes striped.How they drink nectar with their long noses. How they spread pollen,which makes more flowers grow.
"Theyfly far, but wherever they land, they make new friends," Kavyasays, squeezing Mary’s hand. "They’re very small, but they’realso very brave.""Justlike you," Laila Miss says.Kavyasmiles a smile as wide as a butterfly’s wings.
Makea Butterfly Rest StationButterfliesin India migrate twice a year. Their journey is getting harder andharder because our forests and rivers are disappearing. Butterfliesdon’t have enough places to rest. Many get tired along the way. Oneway to help butterflies is to make safe spaces for them to stop andhave a good meal.
Here’show to make a butterfly rest station:Find	a flat vessel with high edges, like a thali or	a	plate.Butterflies	love bright colours. Paint the vessel red, yellow, or orange.Fill	the vessel with butterfly food. It’s easy to make! Mix four cups	of water with one cup of sugar.
Add pieces of over-ripe fruit. Butterflies love bananas, guavas, mangoes, papayas, and oranges.Keep the vessel out on your veranda, windowsill, or anywhere outside.Clean and refill the vessel every two to three days.To attract even more butterflies, plant flowers that butterflies love. You can plant verbena, geraniums, dahlias, or sunflowers. You don’t need a lot of space – you can plant them in pots on the ground, or keep them on windowsills.

Why have you not done your homework?Miss, it is all because of the cat.
The cat sat on the tree.So I took a ladder to climb the tree.
But the ladder was broken. So I took a hammer.The hammer made a noise.So the baby woke up.
Mother ran out to see the baby.So the monkey came in.
The monkey ate all the food.So there was no food for us.
Father bought chicken biryani for us.So the dog followed him.
The dog ate my notebook.So I couldn't bring my homework.
So, the dog ate your homework?
Yes, Miss. But it is all because of the cat.

#6FrameStoryChallenge: A Carnival of ArtThe illustrations in this book were created as part of the #6FrameStoryChallenge, an online campaign run by Pratham Books to build a rich bank of illustrations for StoryWeaver. The essence of the #6FrameStoryChallenge was to tell a good story using just 6 illustrations.  The campaign inspired nearly 70 illustrators to donate their time and skills to India’s first open-source story-publishing platform for children. What started out as an experimental campaign soon blossomed into a carnival of art, birthing nearly 500 new illustrations.These wordless narratives cut across language barriers, opening up a world of possibilities, encouraging StoryWeaver’s growing community to dream up multiple stories around these images. The #6FrameStoryChallenge is a powerful reminder of the need for collaboration, to get closer to our mission: “A Book in Every Child’s Hand.”

Sringeri Srinivas was having a very bad day.Nobody wanted the sweet, ripe bananas he was growing on his farm.
Not his family.Not his neighbour.Not his friends.
Not the traders who could sell the bananas in far away markets. And not even his cows!
“No, thank you,” they all said. “The bananas are very sweet but we have had too many. We cannot eat any more!”
Poor Sringeri Srinivas!What was he to do now with his rich harvest of bananas?
He decided to seek help from the Farmer's Centre in Doddooru, a big town near his village
Off he went carrying the best crop of bananas.Surely someone there would have a good idea for him.
A few days later, Sringeri Srinivas returned home looking very happy. He went back to growing bananas on his farm.
But he did not offer the fruits to anyone anymore.
Not to his family.Not to his neighbour.Not to his friends.
Not to the traders who could sell the bananas in far away markets. And not even to his cows!
Everyone became very curious.Where were all the bananas going?
One day, neighbour Shivanna arranged a very big pooja.
The priest asked him to get 108 ripe bananas as an offering to the gods.
Shivanna ran to Sringeri Srinivas. “I’m sorry for saying no to you before, but now I need 108 ripe bananas.Can you help me, please?”
Sringeri Srinivas tapped his chin. “Well, my crop has just been cut but let me see what I can do. You may start your pooja. I will surely come.”
The pooja started.The whole village came to watch.The priest began chanting.
Soon it became time to offer bananas to the gods.
Just then, in came Sringeri Srinivas carrying a big bag.
From the bag, he carefully took out 27 packets and laid them out before the holy fire. Each packet was carefully wrapped in banana leaf.
On each one was written - “High Quality Banana Halwa, S.S. Farms.” Sringeri Srinivas offered one to the priest.
“Each one has the pulp of 4 bananas. There are 27 packets. So here are your 108 ripe bananas!”
The priest was so surprised that he forgot to chant. In the silence, one child began to laugh.
Soon the whole village was laughing and clapping.
Now we know what Sringeri Srinivas does with all the bananas that he grows!
DID YOU KNOW?Facts About Bananas The word banana is derived from the Arabic word for ‘finger’. India is the largest producer of bananas in the world. There are over 120 edible varieties of bananas grown here. The National Research Centre on Bananas in Trichy has a collection of 1120 banana varieties! Bananas are high in minerals that help increase brain power. Bananas make students more active and alert. Many Indian sweets are made out of bananas - Banana Payasam in Kerala, Banana Rasayana in Karnataka, Banana Halwa, Rawa Kela-Gur Mithai. Do you know some more?
In the busy city,  far away from a caring life at home,  lived a group of homeless boys. They welcomed each day just as it came. On one morning,  the boys were packing their mats after sleeping on cold pavements. To chase away the cold they lit a fire. Among the group of boys was Magozwe. He was the youngest.
When Magozwe's parents died,  he was only five years old. He went to live with his uncle. This man did not care about the child. He did not give Magozwe enough food. He made the boy do a lot of hard work.
If Magozwe complained or questioned,  his uncle beat him. When Magozwe asked if he could go to school,  his uncle beat him and said,  "You're too stupid to learn anything." After three years of this treatment Magozwe ran away from his uncle. He started living on the street.
Street life was difficult and most of the boys struggled daily just to get food. Sometimes they were arrested,  sometimes they were beaten. When they were sick,  there was no one to help. The boys survived from begging, and selling plastics and other recycling.
One day while Magozwe was looking through the dustbins,  he found an old tattered storybook. He cleaned the dirt from it and put it in his sack. Every day after that he would take out the book and look at the pictures. He did not know how to read the words.
The pictures told the story of a boy who grew up to be a pilot. Magozwe would daydream of being a pilot. Sometimes,  he imagined that he was the boy in the story.
It was cold and Magozwe was standing on the road begging. A man walked up to him. "Hello,  I'm Thomas. I work at a place where you can get something to eat," he said. Thomas pointed to a house nearby. "I hope you will go there to get some food?" he asked. Magozwe looked at the man,  and then at the house. "Maybe," he said,  and walked away.
Over the months that followed,  the homeless boys got used to seeing Thomas around. He liked to talk to people,  especially people living on the streets. Thomas listened to the stories of people's lives. He was patient and respectful. Some of the boys started going to the yellow house to get food.
Magozwe was sitting on the pavement looking at his picture book when Thomas sat down next to him. "What is the story about?" asked Thomas. "It's about a boy who becomes a pilot," replied Magozwe. "What's the boy's name?" asked Thomas. "I don't know,  I can't read," said Magozwe.
When they met,  Magozwe began to tell his own story to Thomas. It was the story of his uncle and why he ran away. Thomas didn't talk a lot,  and he didn't tell Magozwe what to do,  but he always listened carefully.
Around Magozwe's tenth birthday,  Thomas gave him a new storybook. It was a story about a village boy who grew up to be a famous soccer player. Thomas read that story to Magozwe many times,  until one day he said,  "I think it's time you went to school and learned to read. What do you think?" Thomas explained that he knew of a place where children could stay,  and go to school.
Magozwe thought about this new place,  and about going to school. What if his uncle was right and he was too stupid to learn anything? What if they beat him at this new place? He was afraid. "Maybe it is better to stay living on the street," he thought.
He shared his fears with Thomas. Over time the man reassured the boy that life could be better at the new place.
And so Magozwe moved into a house and shared the room with two other boys. There were ten children living at that house. Along with Auntie Cissy and her husband,  three dogs,  a cat,  and an old goat.
Magozwe started school and it was difficult. He had a lot to catch up. Sometimes he wanted to give up. But he thought about the pilot and the soccer player in the storybooks. Like them,  he did not give up.
Magozwe was sitting in the yard at the house where he stayed,  reading a storybook from school. Thomas came up and sat next to him. "What is the story about?" asked Thomas. "It's about a boy who becomes a teacher," replied Magozwe. "What's the boy's name?" asked Thomas. "His name is Magozwe," said Magozwe with a smile.
Chicken and Millipede were friends. But they were always competing. One day, they decided to play football to see who was the best player.
They went to the football field and started their game. Chicken was fast, but Millipede was faster. Chicken kicked far, but Millipede kicked further. Chicken started to feel angry.
They decided to play a penalty shoot-out. First Millipede was goal keeper. Chicken scored only one goal. Then it was Chicken's turn to defend the goal.
Millipede kicked the ball and scored. Millipede dribbled the ball and scored. Millipede headed the ball and scored. Millipede scored five goals!
Chicken was furious that she lost. She was a very bad loser. Millipede started laughing because his friend was making such a fuss.
Chicken was so angry that she opened her beak wide and swallowed Millipede.
As Chicken was walking home, she met Mother Millipede. Mother Millipede asked, "Have you seen my child?" Chicken didn't say anything. Mother Millipede was worried.
Then Mother Millipede heard a tiny voice. "Help me mom!" cried the voice. Mother Millipede looked around and listened carefully. The voice came from inside the chicken.
Mother Millipede shouted, "Use your special power my child!" Millipedes can make a bad smell and a terrible taste. Chicken began to feel ill.
Chicken burped. Then she swallowed and spat. Then she sneezed and coughed. And coughed. Millipede tasted disgusting!
Chicken coughed until she coughed out Millipede. Mother Millipede and her child crawled up a tree to hide.
From that time, all chickens and millipedes were enemies.

“Namhlanje ngizobhukuda emanzini ajulile, habe! Angiseyona ingane mina, ngizobamangalisa bonke,” kusho uKhosi.Wagxumela emanzini ngokushesha…waya phansi, wenyuka, waphinde washona phansi ezabalaza ukukhipha ikhanda ngaphezu kwamanzi.Kwenzeka konke lokhu uNozipho ubhekile esokhalweni lomfula.
Kwabonakala sengathi wonke umuntu osemanzini uyakuthokozela ukubhukuda, kwazise lalibalele nasebukhweni bezinja.Kwakuzalele ihlokohloko emanzini engekho olalele omunye.Babememezana bethokozile impela.
Uthe ebhekisisa uNozipho wabona ukubhukuda angakwejwayele.UKhosi wabonakala ekude nakwezinye izingane enzansi nomfula.Wasondela ebhekisisa lensambatheka. Wethuka, wagijima alibangise kwabesifazane ababegeza izingubo emfuleni.“Sizani bo! Yelekelelani nangu!” uNozipho eminza.
Ngokuphazima kweso umama Sophie wagxumela emanzini, ngesivinini esikhulu.Wacwila, wavumbuka, waphinda wacwila waze wafinyelela kuKhosi.Wathi ukufika kuye wamuthi xhasi! Ngesandla ephuma naye emanzini.Waphuma naye emanzini esembelethe emhlane.
Washeshisa, edlula isigejane sezingane nabesifazane ababelila belilela uKhosi enyuka elibhekise emzini.UNozipho wayethe ne! ezithendeni zika mamaSophie owayebelethe umngane wakhe emhlane belibangise emtholampilo.
Emthalampilo bahlangatshezwa ngumhlengikazi UNoxolo owabaphuthuma ngosizo.Abanye abahlengikazi baphuthuma besizana nomhlengikazi uNoxolo ekuhlengeni impilo kaKhosi.“Uphephile, sinenhlanhla ngoba akazange abe semanzini isikhathi eside.”
Umama Sophie waphefumula njengomuntu owayethukile kakhulu kodwa osethole ithemba.Bonke abebekhona emtholampilo bamncoma ngesibindi sakhe.“Ngiyabonga ukuba sethubeni lokusindisa impilo,” esho ngokuzithoba.

A long time ago, three girls went out to collect wood.
It was a hot day so they went down to the river to swim. They played and splashed and swam in the water.
Suddenly, they realised that it was late. They hurried back to the village.
When they were nearly home, Nozibele put her hand to her neck. She had forgotten her necklace! "Please come back with me!" she begged her friends. But her friends said it was too late.
Nozibele went back to the river alone. She found her necklace and began hurrying home. But, she got lost in the dark.
In the distance she saw light coming from a hut. She walked quickly towards it and knocked at the door.
The dog said, "Cook for me!" "But I've never cooked for a dog before," Nozibele answered. "Cook, or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele cooked some food for the dog.
Then the dog said, "Make the bed for  me!" Nozibele answered, "I've never made a bed for a dog." "Make the bed, or I'll bite you!" the dog said. Nozibele made the bed.
Every day she had to cook and sweep and wash for the dog. Then one day the dog said, "Nozibele, today I have to visit some friends. Sweep the house, cook the food and wash my things before I come back."
As soon as the dog had gone, Nozibele took three hairs from her head. She put one hair under the bed, one behind the door, and one in the kraal. Then she ran home as fast as she could.
When the dog came back, he looked for Nozibele. "Nozibele, where are you?" he shouted. "I'm here, under the bed," said the first hair. "I'm here, behind the door," said the second hair. "I'm here, in the kraal," said the third hair.
The dog knew that Nozibele had tricked him. He ran and ran all the way to the village. But Nozibele's brothers were waiting there with big sticks. The dog turned and ran away and has never been seen since.

Long, long ago, Sun, Moon, Rain and Wind were fighting.
The trouble was that Sun wanted to shine the whole day. Moon wanted to shine her light every day. Rain wanted to rain every day, and Wind wanted to blow every day. They didn't want to give each other a chance.
They decided to sit together and talk about it. Sun asked Moon, "What do you do that helps the earth?" Moon answered, "I shine at night so that the animals can hunt."
Moon asked Rain, "What do you do that helps the earth?" Rain answered, "I give the earth water so that the trees and plants can grow well. I give water for animals to drink."
Rain asked Wind, "What do you do that helps the earth?" Wind answered, "I sweep the earth clean. I scatter the rain over the whole earth."
Wind asked Sun, "What do you do that helps the earth?" Sun answered, "I give the earth light and warmth, so that animals and plants can live."
Sun, Moon, Rain and Wind listened carefully to each other.
Then Sun said, "It is true that each of us helps the earth in our own special way." "Yes", said Moon, "Not one of us is better than the others." "We can work together," said Rain. Wind said, "Then let us share the days." They all agreed.
And that is why you sometimes see the moon when the sun is shining. And sometimes you feel the wind when it is raining. Sun, Moon, Rain and Wind work very well together. They understand each other.
Do you like the sun, moon, the rain or the wind? Draw the one you like best.
The wind roars. It roars past our home.
The wind is powerful. It tears my kite from my hand.
I run after my kite. The wind blows me away from the kite!
The wind becomesa tornado. It carries my kite higher and higher.
The tornado swallows me up! I see nothing, I touch nothing.
Where is my kite now? Perhaps it is caught in a tree.
Perhaps my kite is still flying in the sky.
The wind finally dies down. I am still spinning.
When I stop spinning I look around. Where did the wind go?
I cannot see my kite anywhere. I cannot hear the wind anymore.
Perhaps tomorrowI will find my kite.
Now, I must go home, before the wind starts to roar again.
Rabbit was sleeping under an apple tree. An apple fell down from a branch.
A voice said, "Run Rabbit run!" She woke up quickly and ran away with great speed.
She met Chicken. "Why are you running?" asked Chicken. Rabbit replied, "I don't know. I just heard something falling and a voice said, 'Run Rabbit run!'"
Chicken was frightened. She started running when she heard what Rabbit said.
They met Dog. Dog asked, "Why are you running?" Chicken said, "I don't know. I just heard what Rabbit said, and she doesn't know. She heard something falling and a voice said, 'Run Rabbit run!'"

He heard what Chicken said and she doesn't know. She heard what Rabbit  said and she doesn't know. She heard something falling and a voice said, 'Run rabbit run!'"

She heard what Dog said and he doesn't know. He heard what Chicken said and she doesn't know. She heard what Rabbit said and she doesn't know.

The boy laughed and said, "An apple fell off the tree because of the wind. I'm the one who said, 'Run Rabbit run!'"

There was only one bus in Ebei's village. It was big and blue. It was very noisy.
“Tomorrow we will go to town,” said Ebei's mother. “We will buy your school uniform.”
Ebei was very excited. They would travel in the big blue bus. He could not sleep that night.
When his mother came to wake him, Ebei was already dressed.
Ebei and his mother walked to the bus stop. They waited for the big blue bus. But the bus did not come.
Other people arrived at the bus stop. They complained because the bus was late. “Where is the bus?” they asked.
Ebei was worried. “We will not be able to go to town,” he thought. “I will not be able to get my uniform.”
Some people gave up and went home. Ebei cried. He did not want to go. “We will wait a bit longer,” said his mother.
Suddenly, they heard a noise. They saw dust in the air. The bus was coming!
But this bus was not blue. It was not big. It was red and small. The people did not want to get in this bus.
“Get in! Get in!” shouted the driver. “We are very late today,” he called.
Ebei and his mother got in first. Soon everyone else got in the small red bus.
Ebei looked out the window. He saw more people at the bus stop.
Even more people were running to catch the bus. But they were too late. The red bus was full. It left for town.
“Where is the big blue bus?” asked Ebei's mother. “It broke down,” replied the driver. “We are fixing it. It will come tomorrow.”
Ebei did not care about the colour of the bus. He did not care about the size. This bus was going to town!
Every time I take a warm shower, water feels cold on my body. Who does this ? It's the wind, of course !
The milk in my cup is very hot. But when it reaches my throat, it is cold.Who did that ? Of course, it is the air around us !
There is a curtain behind the window and the curtain is moving.The wind is brushing against my face.Who does that ?  Wind, of course !
I can see the clouds in the sky and they are moving towards me.I can hear the thunder and see the lightning in the sky.Who does that ?  Wind, of course !
Branches of tree are bending. Leaves are moving.Flowers are dropping from the plants to the ground.Who does this ?  Wind, of course !
I am playing outside the house but I smell something that's sweet.My mother is making sweets.Why do I get that smell ? Because of the wind, of course !
There was a glass on the window sill, it fell down all of a sudden.The glass broke into hundred pieces.I swear, I didn't break it.Because of the wind, it fell down and broke !
I can hear the sound of a train coming.Chuku....buku.....I can't see the train but I can hear it coming.Why because of the wind I can hear the sound.
You can't see it, it won't talk.
But it does a lot of work.Who ? The wind.
I  wonder if  there's another me somewhere in the  world. THOUGHTS  FOR  YOUR  CHILD What do you think – is there another animal just like this one, somewhere in the world? There are five trees in this picture. If you take away the one tree on one side, how many trees are left on the other side?
Who looks  the same. THINK ABOUT THE FOLLOWINGWhen you look in a mirror, or a reflective surface like this  water, you see a reflection of your image. An image that has one side that looks like the reflection  of the other side is said to be symmetric. Most people's faces are very close to being symmetric. Do you see some things in your room that are symmetric?
And  talks  the  same. ACTIVITIESThis animal is listening to its echo across a canyon.  Have you ever been someplace where you can hear  an echo? Does your echo sound exactly like you, or is it different somehow?
who even has curls just like mine. ACTIVITIESThe hippo and the mouse both have a tail that is  curled, but they are certainly not the same as our friend. Describe some ways that those two animals are  different from our friend. Pick someone you know, and describe some ways that you are similar to them and different from them.
Someone with eyes and ears like mine. ACTIVITIESThis animal has 3 eyelashes on each side. How many eyelashes is that all together?
Who even laughs just like me. MORE ACTIVITIES TO DOCan you make sounds like some of the animals?  Can you neigh like a horse?Oink like a pig?Meow like a cat, or bray like a donkey?
Who can do what I can do.....THINGS YOUR CHILD DOESThey are so happy running along together. Do you feel happy when you are running freely in a big open  space like that? Do you prefer to run with someone or by yourself? They are running by some rocks. How many rocks are there? There are two big rocks near the path. If you take the big rocks away, how many rocks are left?
...and can't do what I can't do.DIFFICULT THINGS TO DOWhy are the animals having trouble peeling a banana?  Can you peel a banana easily? Are there things, such as fruit or packages, that you  have trouble opening?
I've looked and looked everywhere to find another  me. I went down to the park and looked behind the  trees. THINGS THAT YOUR CHILD WONDERS ABOUTWhat animal did he see when he looked behind the tree? Why was it another animal just like him? Is that what he was looking for?
I looked up and down, left and right and all around.WHAT DOES YOUR CHILD THINK?That first picture is just silly. How would that animal  ever climb to the top of a tree? Do you think the bird is surprised to see it there?
I looked at every animal I found.CAN YOUR CHILD ADD NUMBERS?There are three animals on one side of the pond and  one more on the other side.  If you put them all together, how many animals are there at the pond? Similarly, if you remove the one animal on one side of the pond from the group of four animals that are  at the pond, how many animals are left?The two facts – that 3 + 1 = 4 and 4  – 1 =  3 – are tied together and are called a math fact family.
I couldn't find anywhere, anybody who looked just like me.WHAT DOES YOUR CHILD THINK?Do you think his shadow temporarily fooled him into thinking that there was another animal just like him?Does your shadow look like you? Have you ever seen someone's shadow and thought  that the shadow was really a person?
There's only one me in the world! I am very special you see.DIFFERENCES IN ANIMALSHow many animals can you count in this picture?Describe some of the ways that each one of them is different from our friend.
But I am not the only special one. There is only one of you too!EACH PERSON IS UNIQUEDo you know someone who is very similar to you? Perhaps they are the same age or the same height,  or perhaps their hair is similar to yours.  Despite the similarities, they are probably not exactly the same as you.
Malela village was surrounded by hills. Many snakes lived in the forest on those hills. The biggest snake was called python by the villagers. Python scared many people. It swallowed whole goats and sheep.
One day, three sisters, Mutale, Mutinta and Mabvuto went to the forest to fetch firewood. The girls' grandmother warned, "Beware of Python the big snake. Do not take anything from the forest except the wood."  Only Ajoh did not pay attention to her grandmother.
The girls packed milk, bananas, sweet potatoes and water. They took ropes for tying firewood and a sharp dagga for chopping the wood. Then they left for the forest.
On the way, the sisters chatted and laughed. Suddenly,  Mutale, the eldest of them, said, "Be quiet. We are coming to where Unyalego the snake lives."
Mabvuto called to the others, "Look, here are Python's golden teeth. Let us take them."  Mutale reminded them, "Don't forget grandmother's warning. We must not take anything from the forest except firewood."
Mutinta said, "I don't trust grandmother. She said that to stop us having what we want. I want the golden teeth." Her sisters were worried, but Mutinta did not care.
At that moment Python came looking for his golden teeth. He was furious when he could not find the teeth. Then python heard the girls chatting and laughing. He hid under a rock next to the road where the girls would pass on their way back.
The sisters were going home carrying their firewood. Suddenly, they heard, "Hssssss!" There was Python with his mouth wide open, ready to bite. The girls were terrified.
Python asked the girls, "Who took my golden teeth?" No one answered. Python decided to test the girls. "Whoever is innocent,  will be able to sing well. She will go home with her wood. But the guilty one will sing badly. And I will eat her!"
Mutale started to sing with a clear voice, "It was not me,  it was not me who took the teeth. The one who took is still behind." Then Mabvuto sang the song. She also sang well.
Lastly, it was Mutinta's turn. She was scared. She started singing. It  sounded terrible and the words were wrong. Python shouted, "Can't you sing properly like the others?" Python knew that Mutinta took his golden teeth.
Python opened his huge jaws and swallowed Mutinta. Her sisters ran back to the village. They told everyone the story of what happened. "I warned her, if only she had listened," the girls' grandmother said sadly.
'Wov! What a lovely raincoat!' Mannu danced happily holding the shining red raincoat that his parents had bought for him.'Mamma, may I wear the raincoat now?' Manu asked his mother.Mamma said, 'No, my child. You can wear it when it rains. It should start raining soon. But as of now I don't see any signs of the rain.'
But, Monday was a bright sunny day, full of golden sunshine.Mannu looked out of the window every now and then and asked his mother,'Mamma, will it rain today?'Mamma  peeped out of the window and said, ' I don't think it will rain today. You cannot wear the raincoat today. People will laugh at you, if you do.'
On Tuesday also Mannu kept looking at the sky. And the raincoat was kept right next to him, ready to be used. But the sky was a nice blue and as bright as it was on Monday.Mannu was disappointed,'Mamma, when will I be able to use the raincoat?''There is just a single cloud in the sky today, and that too a white one. I don't think you will get a chance to wear the raincoat today.'Mamma said.
Wednesday again was a very hot sunny day.Mannu was getting worried, 'Mamma, why is it not raining yet?'He tried to put the raincoat on at home. But had to immediately take it off because he felt too hot in it.Mamma, in her eagerness to comfort him said, 'I think it will rain soon, probably by afternoon.'
On Thursday, there was the school picnic. Mannu was eager to show off the raincoat to his school buddies.'Mamma, shall I carry the raincoat to the picnic. What if it rains there?' Mannu asked.'Don't, my pet. It will not rain today. See those white clouds? And they are also so far away.' Mamma tried to comfort him.
And... at last  on Friday, the sky looked quite dark with black clouds. Mannu kept the raincoat ready at hand.'Mamma, it will rain today, right mamma?' Mannu asked excitedly. The peacock also seemed to think so and started dancing. The tortoise came out of it's hiding and looked up at the sky hoping perhaps to feel cooler after the hot summer.'I think so. Today the sky is full of black clouds.' Mamma smiled at Mannu's excitement and was happy for him.
On the Saturday morning there was a loud thunder.  And also lightening.'Mamma, it that not lightening? Now it will surely rain, right Mamma?' asked Manu.He ran out on the lawns and saw that a frog and a tortoise also had come out of their hiding.
And.. tip...tap...tip...tap... came down the raindrops!Mannu, loved the rains...raincoat or no raincoat.'Oh, it is raining; it is raining.' Thus shouting  Mannu ran out of the house and started  jumping and dancing in the rain. And he had the company of the frog who also seemed to be  waiting for the rains.
'Wait Mannu, wait.' Mamma ran after him with his raincoat in her hand. 'You forgot your raincoat!'But Mannu was very happy getting drenched in rains. The raincoat which he was holding close to himself all this time was all forgotten.

Mama K has been harvesting cabbages all week. Doobie, Maya and Duksie help Mama K in her vegetable garden on Saturday mornings. Today the children are going to help with counting and packing the cabbages. Then Baba K will take boxes of cabbages to sell at the market.
The taxi drops off the children at the garden gate. They can seethe huge heap of cabbages piled up near Baba K's old truck. "Yo! What a lot of cabbages!" says Maya pointing."There must be a thousand cabbages there!" laughs Duksie. "No way! Two hundred at the most!" disagrees Doobie.
Mama K is waiting at the gate. "Hello everyone, I'm happy to see you!" she greets the children. "Now let's get to work. You'll need to count the cabbages and put them into boxes, 12 cabbages in each box. I have 20 boxes. Two of you can each pack 7 boxes and one of you can pack 6 boxes."
The children stand around the pile of cabbages. They talk about different ways to count the cabbages. "I think I will count mine in 2s," Maya says."I like counting in 4s," says Duksie, "it's quicker." "I'm goingto count in 3s, just to be different!" pipes up Doobie.
Soon the children have filled 20 boxes. "Good work!" exclaims Mama K. "Look, there are some cabbages left over. My pigs love cabbages so let's share these with them," she suggests. "How many cabbages did youpack into boxes? How many cabbages were left over?" she asksthe children.
The next job is to write the price on each box and then help Baba K load the boxes on his truck. They must put half the boxes on one side of the truck and half on the other side, to balance the load.
"We're almost done!" says Baba K. "Let's see, how many more boxes we must still put on each side to balance the load?"
Soon all 20 boxes are loaded onto the truck. Baba K warms up the engine and drives off to market. "If I can sell all the boxes," he thinks to himself, "I'll have enough money to fix the pig pen andget a surprise forthe children!"
Back at the farm, Mama K and the children water plants and rake leaves. By twelve o'clock they are all tired. Mama K tells them, "It's time for your treat. Can you guess what I have for you today?"
She goes inside to fetch their surprise. The children wait patiently for her to return while they guess what shemight bring them. When she comes down the path her apron pockets are bulging!
"Let's see if you guessed right! What's in store for you today?" Mama K tips out her apron pockets and a pile of apples falls onto the table. "See, I was right!" Duksie squeals. Mama K tells the children, "Now remember the rule. Share fair! No one to get more or less than the other!"
First the children count the apples in 2s. They count: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 1 apple left over. Altogether there are 17 apples.
Next, they share out the apples equally. There are 2 apples left over. The children then put their apples in their bags to take home. How many does each child get?
"Let's cut the 2 apples to share between us," suggests Duksie. "How many parts of the apple will we each get?" asks Maya. "I know the answer!" smiles Doobie.
Just then Baba K arrives home from market. The truck is empty and Baba K is smiling. "I sold all the cabbages. Now I can fix the pig pen and buy you that soccer ball you wanted. "Yay!" shout the children."
I wake up and make fire.
I boil some water.
I chop the firewood.
I stir the pot.
I sweep the floor.
I wash the dishes.
When my brother is busy playing!
It was a hot summer day in the dry forest.
Little Ant had no water for many days.
"I need a drop of water, even if it falls from a leaf," cried Little Ant.
But even the dew had dried up.
"If I do not have water, I will die," cried Little Ant. "I must go to the river I heard about."
"The river is full and strong. It will sweep you away," warned a wise squirrel.
But Little Ant was extremely thirsty. "I will die if I don't drink some water."
So, he went to look for the river.
He walked past tufts of grass and over dry branches.
He walked until he heard water splashing. It was the river! He could hear waves.
Little Ant took a long sip of cool water.
He was so happy he did not see a wave coming.
Little Ant tried to grab some grass floating past him. But he was swept away by the water.
"Help me someone. Help me please!" he called.
"Quick, climb on," said White Dove, holding a branch in her beak.
White Dove saved Little Ant from drowning in the river.
"I will stay here until I can thank the dove," decided Little Ant. "I will wait until she comes back to drink."
One day as he waited, two boys came to the river. They had their slingshots.
"There is a big white dove that comes here to drink," said one boy.
"Let's kill it and have it for supper tonight," said the other boy.
"I cannot let the boys kill White Dove," thought Little Ant. "But I am so tiny, what can I do?"
Just then White Dove flew down from the tree to drink.
The naughty boys got ready to shoot White Dove.
Little Ant had an idea.
Little Ant jumped onto one boy's foot. He bit that boy as hard as he could.
The boy jumped. "Ouch!" he shouted.
White Dove was startled and flew away to safety.
That was how Little Ant thanked White Dove for saving him.
Mother, Father and Laraba are talking about how to stay healthy.
Laraba asked at school, "Why must we wash our hands?"
Teacher said, "Our hands have germs on them, but you can't see germs."
"Germs are very tiny. We need a microscope to see them."
Laraba looked through the microscope.She saw the germs from her hand.
"Viruses and bacteria are types of germs.Germs can make us sick."
"Washing hands stops viruses and bacteria from spreading," said Teacher.
Father is making a tool for washing hands.
Laraba asks, "How does this tool work?"
"The wooden step tilts the container, and water flows out."
"Wash with soap and water. Slowly count to 20 while you wash."
"Clever Dad! Now, can you greet with your elbow?"
One day a rat saw a Biiigggg Bun... "Ah, ha... what a lovely feast. Let me take this to my hollow," she said.
She pushed the bun from the back. AAAAeeeeee!!!huh!!!It did not move.
The Rat pushed the bun from forward. Did it move? Oh, not at all!
The Rat pushed the bun from right. Oh no, still the same.
The rat ran and pushed the bun from the left. Did it dare to move? no, not at all!!
"Isn't this crazy" the rat thought. "Let me tie a thread and then move, may be" jumped the rat.
The rat came out with a thread, within no time.  She tied the bun with a long piece of thread and,...now started to pull!
"Ah, i can't" cried the tired rat. But, she has an idea!"Umm, But let me just eat it here," she said and bit a piece of bun. "Yummm, so tasty", she said. She ate two pieces now. And, ate a bit more. And, few more too. It ate so much that the size of the bun is now small!!
The rat started pushing the bun again. The eatery just slipped to the hollow. "Ah! Finally, it is in"The rat just couldn't stop grinning. But, Oh, ho!! Now, the rat's stomach is full!
The rat tried to get into the hollow. But, she just can't!!
The rat sits outside the hollow. Her stomach is so full that, she just cannot enter the hollow!! "Huh, i ate too much," the rat cried.

My little brother sleeps late. I wake early,  because I am great!
I am the one who lets in the sun.
"You're my morning star," says Ma.
I wash myself every day,  I don't need any help.
I don't mind cold water, or the blue soap that washes clothes.
Ma reminds,  "Don't forget your teeth." I reply,  "Never,  not me!"
After washing,  I greet Grandpa and Auntie. I wish them a good day.
Then I dress myself.  "I'm big now, Ma," I say.
I can close my buttons and buckle my shoes.
I make sure my brother knows all the school news.
In class I do my best in every way.
I do all these good things every day. But the thing I like most,  is to play and play!
I love my teacher.
She is a good teacher. She is kind and patient.
She has braided her hair so nicely.
She has put colourful beads in her hair.
Her beads are green, white, red, and yellow.
Mom, please would you braid my hair like my teacher's?
When I am older I will put beads in my hair.
I will grow up to be just like my teacher!

When the last school bell rang, all the children laughed and screamed with joy.                                                    All, except Akku. Akku was ANGRY!
"Akku! Akku! Look at the pretty sunflowers!" said Appa, as they rode   through a field."Oh no! They’re TOO YELLOW! They’re making my eyes hurt!" said Akku.
Akku! Akku! Look! Look at all the monkeys!" said Appa, pointing at the roof of their house.                              "oh no!" said Akku. Go AWAY!
"Here, drink some buttermilk," said Appa. "It’ll cool you down.""NO!" said Akku. "I DON’T WANT ANY!""Try a sip, at least?""OKAY! FINE!" said Akku, and tried a sip.It wasn’t all that bad.She had another sip.  And another.In no time, the glass was empty.
"Would you like a vada?" asked Appa.  "NO" said Akku."Just one little bite?""Okay, FINE!" said Akku, and took a bite. It  was quite good.She took another bite.And another.In no time, the plate was empty.
"Good girl," said Appa. "Now will you tell me why you’re so angry?"    "NO!" said Akku."Was it something I did?""NO!""Was it something Amma did?""NO!""Did something happened in school today?"     "MAYBE!"        "Oho."
"Would you like to draw it?" asked Appa. "Here’s a nice sheet of paper and some crayons."                                                                                                                                     "Okay, FINE!" said Akku.
Akku drew a brick… "This is the BRICK that I tripped over this morning," said Akku.                   "You’re right. That is a  brick!" said Appa.
And Akku drew a boy…"This is Bikku, The BOY who laughed at me when I fell down!" said Akku.                 "You’re right," said Appa. "He shouldn’t have laughed at you."
And Akku drew an idli…    "This is my idli," said Akku. "It fell out of my lunch box when I tripped over the BRICK!"
And Akku drew a crow…                                              "This is the CROW that flew off with my idli," said Akku.                              "The crow must have been very hungry," said Appa.
And Akku drew her teacher…"This is my teacher, Amala Miss," said Akku."She helped me up when I fell down. And then she hugged me.""That’s nice of her," said Appa."And then she patted my back and said, you would be fine. I DON’T like to be hugged and patted."Are you alright now?" I’m okay now."     "That’s good."
"See how well you draw, Akku?" said Appa."You’re a real artist! Will you draw something for Amma too?""Okay!" said Akku, and      started drawing some more. "This is a little white mouse… and this is a boat…and this is a coconut tree…"
"And this is a sunflower…and this is your cycle, Appa… and this is a dog…and this is a frog…"In no time, Akku had forgotten all about the BRICK that made her trip and fall. And about the BOY who laughed at her. And about the IDLI-CROW.And Akku even forgot about being ANGRY.
10 Things to Do If You Feel ANGRY like Akku:1. Laugh loudly and jump around with your arms in the air!2. Slowly – very, very slowly – breathe in, and breathe out!3. Drink some water! Or buttermilk!4. Eat a piece of fruit! Or a vada!5. Tell a grown-up about how you’re feeling!6. Write about how you’re feeling!7. Draw it out! Paint it!8. Play with a pile of clay!9. Make up a song about your anger! Sing it aloud!10. Do the happy dance!
Shanti and Arun were good friends. They had so much fun together.They shared secrets in class. They ran races on the way home.She was always cheerful.
One day, Shanti came into the classroom slowly. Her head was bent. She looked sad. “Did someone scold you?” asked Arun.Shanti shook her head. She sat down and did not look up. She did not answer ‘Present!’ when Sona Miss called her name. Sona Miss called again, louder this time, “Shanti Kumar!” Shanti raised her hand.
“Do you have a sore throat?” her teacher asked her. Shanti shook her head.Her cheeks were red and it looked like she had a fever.“Are you feeling okay?” Sona Miss asked.Shanti nodded, still not daring to look up.
“Why does Shanti look so sad?”“Is your little brother okay?”“Is your puppy okay?”“Is your grandmother okay?”Shanti kept nodding her head to each of her friends. But she did not look up.
Arun wanted to make her smile. He had an idea! He took out something from his bag.As he ran to show it to Shanti, it slipped out of his hands. Shanti saw something flying towards her and she grabbed it.
It was a BIG, green, rubber frog!Shanti's eyes flew open. Then she opened her mouth to laugh.THEN Arun and her friends saw why she had not smiled or talked all day!Four of her front teeth had gone missing!
I wake up at night feeling thirsty. I want to get some water. I start looking for my slippers under the bed.
Oh my God! There is a tiger under my bed.
Now what should I do?
Should I call Ma? What if the tiger roars?
Should I just go back to sleep? But I am not sleepy any more.
Then someone turns on the light. Ma is standing at the door.
“What happened dear?Did you call me?” asks Ma.
I point towards the tiger. Ma bends and pulls the tiger out from under the bed!
Hey, this is no tiger. This is my thick yellow and black sweater. Its buttons shine like a tiger's eyes.
I got scared for nothing!Ma gets me some water.
Now I will sleep. And dream about real tigers in a jungle!
a warm morning , Raja woke up with a yawn and said to himself "lets go for fishing now".
While going to the pond,he met Ram,his best friend and invited him to go to the pond together.
Sita saw them going for fishing. The boys asked her if she wanted to come with them.
Sita thought for a moment and said "don't do this,fishes will die when separated by water"
They didn't paid attention to her and continued on their way to the pond.
Raja and Ram sat near the pond and saw to fishes jumping in water,one was a thin and second a fat one.
There came a third fish. They didn't saw any fish bigger than this! Sita said" This fish is even bigger than my father's foot!"
Raja and Ram took their fishing rods with and struggled for the fish.Ram said"its mine!"Raja said"no,its mine!"
Raja pulled the rod, Ram pulled stronger.
BOOM! They fell down as their rods broke.
Do you know why ?Any guesses ?fished tied their strings together!
Tulsa wishes she could visit a forest. Her teacher reads stories about tigers to the class. She loves to hear about forests and animals.
One day, her wish comes true! Khare Chacha, a senior forest official, invites Tulsa and her friends to visit a forest called Kanha Tiger Reserve. Tulsa and her friends can’t stop grinning. They will go to the forest for a whole day and a whole night!
It takes four hours by bus from the school to the forest. As soon as Tulsa gets down from the bus, a strong hand shakes her hand and then ruffles her hair. “Welcome to Kanha!” It is Khare Chacha.
Tulsa and her friends Rani, Mithu, and Dipti stay close to one another. “Sniff the air. It smells of trees and leaves!” says Mithu.“The air is clean like it has been washed with soap!” adds Rani.
It's almost sunset now. Khare Chacha and other forest officials tell them about the forest they will visit tomorrow. They play the sounds of animals and birds for the girls to hear and recognise.
PIAON! PIAON! “It’s a peacock!”OOW! OOW!“I know! It’s a barking deer.”KEEE! KEE!“That is the sound of crickets!”Next day, Tulsa wakes up at five in the morning. Brrr! It’s cold! Everyone bundles up in warm clothes. One by one, they get into the bus. “All around us there is tall grass covered in a thick blanket of fog,” Ranveer Uncle, the forest guide, tells them. Tulsa can feel the cold and pure air in her mouth. It tastes like mint leaves.
“Shhh!” Ranveer Uncle whispers. “There are two jackals right next to our bus.” Everyone listens carefully. They hear the rustling sound of the tall grass. Dried leaves crush under their feet, as the jackals run lightly into the dense forest.
Ranveer Uncle whispers again. “A big deer called sambar is standing on the left side of the road. The deer is brown and has big stem-like horns called antlers on its head.” Everyone focuses to their left. HAUNNNNK! HAUNNNK!  The sambar runs off. "Sounds like a very big horn!” says Tulsa. All the girls laugh.
Soon, the air becomes even cooler. “We are near a river now,” Ranveer Uncle says. Tulsa can hear the gurgling of the water. So many birds are calling from the trees.
FHWEEE! FHWEEE!“That one is whistling!” says Rashmi.“Yes Rashmi, that is the call of a thrush,” says Ranveer Uncle.KEEECH! KEECH!“And that screeching you hear is the call of the jungle babbler.”
Soft leaves fall from above. Baby monkeys are showering them with leaves! Tulsa picks up a leaf that falls on her. It smells fresh and pure, just like the forest.
The bus starts moving uphill. “Hold this creeper. See how it feels like a strong rope? The leaves are like cotton!” Everyone takes turns to hold the creeper. “This is the mahul,” says Ranveer Uncle. “The leaves are used to make small bowls.”
PIAONN! PIAONN!“Peacock to your right!” Ranveer Uncle is excited.
“Is he dancing?” asks Tulsa.“Yes!” Uncle says. “His feathers are shining in the winter sun and are sparking like gemstones.” “Beautiful,” says Tulsa.
By now everyone is very hungry. They stop at the forest camp for breakfast. There, Khare Chacha announces a surprise. “Some of our camp elephants are here. They won’t mind if you touch them gently.” Everyone starts squealing in delight. Soon Tulsa is led to the elephant, Tara.
The guide places her hand on Tara’s prickly stomach. Whoomp! Tulsa hears the sound of Tara’s feet moving. Tulsa can feel the powerful muscles under her hand. Trumpeting softly, Tara places her trunk in Tulsa’s hand, looking for food. Tulsa can’t stop smiling, as she feels the wet trunk. It's time to go back. On the way, they pass a gaur. “The gaur is chewing grass. The body is black but the bottoms of the legs are white. It looks like the gaur is wearing socks,” says Ranveer Uncle. Everyone laughs. Suddenly, the air is split by a call, deep and loud.
AUHN! The call comes again.“The tiger is very far,” explains Ranveer Uncle. “But he has probably seen you and wants you to know that.”
Sighing with happiness, Tulsa and her friends head out of the park. There are so many ways to experience the forest! They can't wait to come back to Kanha Tiger Reserve.
This is a real storyIn January 2017, the Last Wilderness Foundation in association with the Kanha Forest Department conducted a camp for 23 visually impaired students from the Ananya Manav Sai Samiti, Jabalpur. The students were taken on a safari and nature trail using their fabulous sensory skills to enjoy the forest.

All of us went to the Dasara fair.
Papa bought Chintu fancy glasses. Mother bought me a bright blue cap. The baby got sugar candy.
On the way home, a very strong wind came.It blew my cap away.
My cap got stuck on a branch of the old Pipal tree.
I cried a lot. And I did not eat my dinner.
Later that night, the moon came up.It looked at my cap on the old Pipal tree.
It tried on my cap. The moon smiled happily. I had to smile too.
After school the next day, my mother gave me a shiny new red cap. “The moon sent it,” she said.
That night, both the moon and I wore our caps and smiled. We were happy.
Do you think the sun needs a hat?
Guess which cap I am wearing today!

I have a friend. She lives in my house.
When I am happy, so is she.
When I cry, she cries too.
But I cannot hear her voice. My friend lives inside the mirror.
“Come out,” I tell her, “we will play.” She does not come out.
I am not happy. I go to sleep.
She comes out of the mirror in my sleep! And we have fun.
We play, we run, we shout and scream together.
When I talk to her, she also talks to me.
In the morning, my friend will go back into the mirror.
But I don't mind at all. We will play again in my dreams!
There was a boy whose name was Abel. He made himself a cart. Abel had no driver for his new cart. He said to his sister Meri, "I want a driver for my cart. Please give me your doll. She can sit in the cart."
But Meri said, "No, I want my doll." When Meri would not let him take the doll, Abel was very angry. He grabbed the doll and pulled her. Meri pulled the doll's other arm. Abel pulled and Meri pulled. The doll's arm came off!
Meri cried and ran to her mother. "Look Mother," she said, "Abel pulled my doll's arm and it came off. He wanted my doll to sit in his new cart but I wanted to play with her." Her mother said, "Abel did not behave well."
Mother thought about how to teach her son not to touch his sister's toys. She had an idea. She went to her friend who was a doctor and she asked, "I want you to help me please." The doctor replied, "How can I help, my friend?"
Mother answered, "My son Abel is behaving badly these days. He pulled the arm off his sister's doll. He must not do that. Tomorrow I will tell him to bring the doll to you to put the doll's arm on again."
"Please tell Abel that he must pay you for your work. He doesn't have any money, so you will tell him to clean your big old car that is always dusty," said mother. Her friend laughed and said, "Ee–ee! That will be good."
Abel's mother went back to her house. She asked Abel, "When you are ill or hurt where do you go?" Abel answered, "When I am ill or hurt, I must go to the doctor." Abel's mother said, "You hurt the doll, now you must take her to the doctor."
So Abel took the doll to the doctor. "This doll is hurt very badly. My mother told me to bring the doll to you. Doctor, can you give her a new arm?" The doctor agreed to look after the doll. She was able to make a new arm.
The doctor said to Abel, "The doll has a new arm. You must pay me. How much money do you have?" Abel answered, "Please doctor, I don't have any money. I can't pay you for your work."
The doctor said, "Well! You don't have any money? My big car is very dirty! Clean my car and that is how you will pay me." Abel got a bucket of water and a clean cloth. It took a long time to wash that dusty car.
Then Abel took the doll back to Meri. She was delighted and she said to Abel, "You are a good brother. Thank you for fixing my doll." "My sister, I'm sorry for getting angry and making you sad," said Abel.
From that day, Abel never took his sister's things again. And he tried his best not to get angry with her.Abel remembered how long it took him to wash the doctor's big, dirty car. He decided it wasn't worth the price to get angry and break things.

Today is  Vasant Panchami. My parents say it is the first day of spring. Spring is the season between winter and summer. It is called Vasant Ritu in Sanskrit.
In many parts of India, people pray to the goddess of learning, music and art on this day. Many birds are sitting on the tree near my house. I think they are singing to me.
The leaves on the tree are new and shiny. Just like my new frock. Amma is also wearing a yellow sari ― such a pretty colour ‘basanti’, and such a pretty name!
Grandpa wants me to plant a tree. “But why?” I ask. “So that you will have a friend to grow up with, Meenu,” he says. “Spring is a good season to start something new.”
We go to the garden. Grandpa and I dig a hole in the ground and plant a sapling. “How tall will it grow?” I ask him.
"Wait and watch, dear Meenu!" he says. The squirrels are chasing each other. Tingu, the cat, chases a squirrel. And I want to chase Tingu.
The garden is full of flowers.I like the yellow roses the best and Grandpa likes the white jasmine.There is a carpet of leaves under some trees.
Many trees have flowers. I like spring! Everything looks so pretty in spring!
Tomorrow is Holi. School is closed for two days. We have made a huge Holika with twigs, and pieces of wood. Some of us went to the forest and brought tesu flowers. Manu put the flowers in a tank of water. The water has turned a bright orange!
Tomorrow we will play Holi with the orange water. We will get gujia and puris to eat. Spring is such a happy season. It is not cold, it is not hot, and it is not wet. I  can play all the time!
It had been raining for days, and everyone was grumpy. Everyone except Sizwe, who woke up with a smile every morning.“Yoh! Sizwe! That smile is magic!” said Gogo.“Is it for me?”Sizwe clapped his hand over his mouth.“But it’s MY smile, Gogo,” he whispered.
His mother laughed. “Sizwe! A smile is something you can give away without losing it. Look!”She lifted him up to the mirror. There was his smile, just as bright as before.
It was time to go out. Mama buttoned up Sizwe’s raincoat, and off they went, through the rain, to the library.Down the street, Sizwe’s best friend Zanele stood at the window of her house, looking sadly at the rain.Sizwe felt his smile creeping, creeping up. Before he knew it, his smile LEAPT out, and flew across the garden to Zanele.
Zanele held on tightly to the smile – it was far too precious to let it get away.As Sizwe walked away to the library, Zanele’s doorbell rang. It was the postman, with a letter from her favourite cousin.Zanele was so happy, that the smile bounced up, and beamed out at the postman.“Thank you, Mister Postman!” she said.
Zanele’s smile was the brightest thing the postman had seen all morning. It kept him warm as he trudged off through the rain.He came to a big house. Inside the gate, a dog was spinning around in circles, barking, barking, barking. He was so silly, that the postman couldn’t help smiling.The smile bounced through the gate with a glitter of glee.
The dog stopped barking. He pricked up his ears and wagged his tail. Then he turned and ran back to the house with the precious, warm smile.A bent old man opened the door. “Oh, no! You can’t come inside. You’re all wet!” he told the dog. But right away, the smile beamed up at the old man.
The old man stood a little straighter. “Eish,” he said, “Who cares if it’s raining? Let’s go for a walk, boy!” And off they went, splashing in the puddles.There, at the zebra crossing, stood grumpy Mrs Makabela, the traffic cop. She looked cold, and wet, and miserable.The old man knew just what to do. “Morning, Mrs Makabela!” he called, and smiled his biggest, brightest smile.But Mrs Makabela… did not smile back.
Standing in the rain for days can make a face sad, sad, sad.But a smile is a magical thing and, by now, the smile was so strong, and so bright, that it was very hard to keep inside.It didn’t work right away, but bit by tiny bit, it began to creep out until, at last…!A great, big smile lit up Mrs Makabela’s face!The school bell rang, and children ran to cross the road. Mrs Makabela put up her sign, and smiled, and smiled, at each and every child.
The children smiled at their moms and dads, and their gogos and tatas and brothers and sisters. They smiled at the bus driver and the greengrocer, and Mrs Makau, who went off to smile at her husband, who smiled at the mayor...The smiles leapt and rolled and beamed and gleamed until EVERYONE was smiling and giggling and laughing out loud in the rain.
In the library, everything was quiet except for the sound of the rain.“It’s time to go,” said Sizwe’s mother, closingher book.“Aw, mom!” said Sizwe, who had run out of smiles.
But as they stepped out into the street…WHAT A SIGHT!Everyone in town was there!Everyone!And they were ALL smiling!
The smiles bounced around and beamed at Sizwe. They warmed him, and tickled him, and crept up, up, up from his toes… to the TOP of his head. He was so full of happiness that the smile burst out, brilliant and beaming bright.And something changed. The dark, gloomy, rainy afternoon didn’t seem so dark anymore.Could it be…? YES!The clouds parted, and the warm sun shone down on them, with the biggest, brightest, most brilliant smile of all.
The small bus stop in my village was busy with people and overloaded buses. On the ground were even more things to load. Touts were shouting the names where the buses were going.
"City! City! Going west!" I heard a tout shouting. That was the bus I needed to catch.
The city bus was almost full,  but more people were still pushing to get on. Some packed their luggage under the bus. Others put their things on the racks inside.
New passengers clutched their tickets as they looked for somewhere to sit in the crowded bus. Women with young children made them comfortable for the long journey.
I squeezed in next to a window. The person sitting next to me was holding tightly to a green plastic bag. He wore old sandals,  a worn out coat,  and he looked nervous.
I looked outside the bus and realised that I was leaving my village,  the place where I had grown up. I was going to the big city.
The loading was completed and all passengers were seated. Hawkers still pushed their way into the bus to sell their goods to the passengers. Each one was shouting the names of what was available for sale. The words sounded funny to me.
A few passengers bought drinks,  others bought small snacks and began to chew. Those who did not have any money,  like me,  just watched.
These activities were interrupted by the hooting of the bus,  a sign that we were ready to leave. The tout yelled at the hawkers to get out.
The hawkers pushed each other to make their way out of the bus. Some gave back change to the travelers. Others made last minute attempts to sell more.
As the bus left the bus stop,  I stared out of the window. I wondered if I would ever go back to my village again.
As the journey progressed,  the inside of the bus got very hot. I closed my eyes,  hoping to sleep.
But my mind drifted back home. Will my mother be safe? Will my rabbits fetch any money? Will my brother remember to water my tree seedlings?
On the way,  I memorised the name of the place where my uncle lived in the big city. I was still mumbling it when I fell asleep.
Nine hours later,  I woke up with loud banging and calling for passengers going back to my village. I grabbed my small bag and jumped out of the bus.
The return bus was filling up quickly. Soon it would make its way back east.  The most important thing for me now,  was to start looking for my uncle's house.
“I can’t lift you up, Shanu!” says Ammi. “You are too big!”
“You can’t walk to school alone, Shanu!” says Abbu. “You are too small!”
“You can’t sleep in the baby’s cot, Shanu!” says Dadu. “You are too big!”
“You can’t carry the baby to the park, Shanu!” says Dadi. “You are too small!”
Shanu is puzzled. Too big! Too small! How can she be too big andtoo small all at once?
Too big to wear her old pink frock.Too small to make dosas at the stove.
Too big to climb up on Dadu’s back?Too smallto carry the baby on hers?
“What am I the right size for?” Shanu wonders.
Ammi smiles and says, “Why, you are just big enough to go to big school.”
“And you are just small enough for me to carry you on my shoulders,” says Abbu.
“You are just big enough to take me for my morning walks,” says Dadu.
“And you are just small enough for me to tell stories to,” says Dadi.
“And you will always, always be the perfect size...for this!" all say, and give her a warm, wonderful hug.
Once upon a time, it happened in a village that a gang of young people decided to kill all the old people. They wanted to stop the old people doing magic.
But one of the youths ran off with his father and hid him in the desert.
After he had done this, the gang began killing the old people.
Not long after, a snake came into the village from the desert.The snake entered into the stomach of a small child. It kept poking its head out of the child's mouth.
The parents of the child and all the other people tried everything to solve this problem.
But they saw that if they killed the snake it would also kill the child. Everyone kept trying different things.
Then, the young man who had hidden his father went and told him everything that had happened. And the old man replied, "That's the easiest thing in the world to take care of!"
The old man said, "Go find a toad and tie it up near the snake. The snake will come out of the child's stomach to catch the toad."The young man did just what his father said. The snake came out and started to chase the toad.
And the child was saved from death.
"Mom," calls Lebo. "Come and look. These clothes are all too small for me!" "Let me see," says Mom.
"Look at my skirt. It's too small," says Lebo. "Yes,  it is," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your skirt."
"Look at my jeans. They're too small," says Lebo. "Yes, they are," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your jeans."
"Look at my T-shirt. It's too small," says Lebo. "Yes, it is," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your T-shirt."
"Look at my jersey. It's too small," says Lebo. "Yes, it is," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your jersey."
"Look at my raincoat. It's too small," says Lebo. "Yes, it is," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your raincoat."
"Look at my socks. They're too small," says Lebo. "Yes, they are," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your socks."
"Look at my shoes. They're too small," says Lebo. "Yes, they are," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your shoes."
"Now you have lots of clothes," says Lebo. "Oh no I don't," says Nomsa. "These clothes are all too big for me!"
Once upon a time, there was a hungry jackal. He was walking around the bush looking for food.
He came across a grapevine. He spotted a bunch of juicy ripe grapes hanging from a high branch.
"Those look really delicious," he thought. He took a few steps back so that he could make his highest jump.
The grapes were too high. Jackal fell on his back without even touching the bunch.
Jackal got up and went further back from his starting spot. He ran, and almost got high enough. But he fell even harder.
He tried again and again. But he couldn't get to the grapes. He kept falling until his back was very sore.
Finally, he gave up and walked away.
He stopped and looked back at the grapes. He was hungrier than ever. "Those grapes look really sour anyway," he thought.
Putta and Puttijumped out of bed. It was Muttajji's birthday and they had a train tocatch!
Muttajji, who wasthe twins' mother's mother's mother,  lived in Mysore with Ajji, whowas the twins' mother's mother.  No one actually knew when Muttajji'sbirthday was; Ajji had always celebrated it on the MakaraSankranthi holiday. "Amma, willthere be a cake?"  asked Putti. "A big, spongy cake withpink icing and a rose on top?""Naah,"said Putta. "Old people don't have birthday cakes. And 200candles won't fit on any cake." "Muttajjiisn't 200 years old, silly," said Putti. "How old isMuttajji, Amma?"Amma smiled. "Whydon't you ask her when we get there?"
The moment theyreached the old green house in Mysore, the twins burst intoMuttajji's room. "Happy birthday, Muttajji! How old are youtoday?" Muttajji huggedthe twins. "How old am I? Who knows?  How does it matter?" "But itdoes!" cried Putta and Putti together.
Muttajji smiled."Well," she said, "I know that around five yearsbefore I was born, our Maharaja went to a grand party for IndianMaharajas and Maharanis in Delhi. A British king and queen had cometo visit, and our Maharaja got a gold medal." "Oooh! Aparty! There must have been lots of cake!" said Putti. "Whowas this king, Muttajji? If you know, we can find out which year hevisited. if we add five years to that, we will know when YOU wereborn!" Muttajjishrugged. "I've forgotten, Putta." Putta's face fell.
"Wait,"said Muttajji. "Let me see if I can remember something else.Aaaan! When I was about your age - nine or ten - my uncle from Bombayvisited us and told us about clean trains.""Cleantrains?" "Yes!"Muttajji was excited. "They had started running in Bombay thatyear. You never got dirty travelling in them.  No black dust on yourclothes and face, no grime, nothing!" The twins staredat her. Why would anyone get dirty travelling by train?
"Some yearslater," continued Muttajji, "I got married. The law wasthat a girl should be at least 15 before she was married, and myfather would never break the law, so I must have been 16 then.  Verysoon after my marriage, your Muttajja got a job in Bombay, and weleft Mysore."  "Didanything important happen the year you got married, Muttajji?" asked Putta. "Yes,"said Muttajji sadly. "Our Maharaja inaugurated our big dam, andthe beautiful gardens next to it, during the Dasara festival thatyear. But I missed it; I was in Bombay. ""A big dam?"Putta sat up. "Is it still there?"
Muttajji hootedwith laughter. "Of course! Rock-solid too. It was the dam thattamed the Kaveri. No more floods in the monsoon, and enough water forthe fields in the summer."Ajji put her headaround the door. "Are you talking about KRS, Amma?""Aaaan,KRS," Muttajji said, looking fondly at Ajji. "Your Ajji wasmy fifth child, the youngest, but always the smartest.  Do you know,twins, my children came like clockwork, one every two monsoons. Theday your Ajji decided to come out, your Muttajja could not be found.Later, he told us that he had gone to see Gandhiji give a speech atthe Gowalia Tank Maidan. He was so excited. 'Quit India!' he keptshouting the whole day, silly man, disturbing the baby.'
"QuitIndia!" Putti's eyes grew round with excitement. "Westudied it in history, Putta! The movement started in 1942! Thatmeans 1942 was the year that... ""...Ajji wasborn," pouted Putta. "Not Muttajji." "That's astart!" said Putti. "Which year were you born, Ajji?""I will be74 this year," said Ajji. "So I was born in?" Puttiquickly did the calculations. "1942!*" she said. Ajjinodded.*(2016 - 74 =1942)
"Now, Ajjiis Muttajji's fifth child and all her kids were two years apart!"said Putta. "So if Ajji was born in 1942...""...Muttajji'sfourth child was born in 1942 - 2 = 1940, the third in 1940 - 2 =1938, the second in 1938 - 2 = 1936, and the first in 1936 - 2 =1934." "So Muttajjiwas married in 1932!" cried Putti. "Notnecessarily," said Putta. "Muttajji didn't say her firstchild was born two years after her marriage. She only said a dam wasbuilt in Mysore the year she got married."
"Maybe thiswill help, twins," said Ajji, bringing in bowls of vermicellipayasa, Muttajji's favourite sweet dish. "KRS is theKrishnarajasagar Dam. The Brindavan Gardens are the gardens attachedto it. We went there last year to see the musical fountains,remember?"The twins nodded."Mmmm," said Putti. "Your payasa is the BEST, Ajji!"  "When wasKRS built, do you know, Ajji?" Ajji shook herhead. "I'm not sure. But you can go with Ajja to the centrallibrary after lunch and find out there."
In the library,Putti found a book on the history of Mysore. "Here it is!"she whispered.  "Two of Mysore's most visited tourist spots,the KRS Dam and the adjacent Brindavan Gardens, were opened to thepublic in 1932.'" The twins grinned - that meant Muttajjihad indeed married in 1932, 84* years ago!  *(2016 - 1932 = 84)
"Muttajjithinks she was 16 when she got married," said Putti, "butshe could have been 15 or 17 or 18.""She alsosaid she was about 9 or 10 when her Bombay uncle told her about the'clean' train," said Putta. "Ajja may know what thatmeans."Ajja was in thereading room. "Ajja," whispered Putti, "in the oldendays, did people get dirty travelling by train?" Ajja nodded."There were steam engines then, which ran on coal, notelectricity," he said. "Black coal dust used to fly out ofthe chimney and land on everyone and everything. Terrible!"  "That's it,Putti!" hissed Putta."Electric trains were the 'clean'trains!"
He pulled out abook on the Indian Railways. "It says here," he pointed,"that India's first electric train came to Bombay in 1925!" "And Muttajji says she was about 9 then," said Putta. "If she is right, then Muttajji was born in 1916*. ""But she could be wrong, you know," frowned Putti. "Only one way to make sure," said Putta. "We have to find out if that big party for kings and queens in Delhi, which Muttajji said happened five years before she was born, happened in 1911**."They ran back to Ajja.*(1925-9 =1916); **(1916 -5 = 1911)
"Ajja, wasthere a grand party for a foreign king who visited India around1911?" Ajja frowned."1911? Why is that date so familiar? Aaan yes. It was the yearthe Gateway of India was built in Bombay. And yes, it was built towelcome the British Emperor of India, George V! There must have beenseveral grand parties, not one." Ajja tapped his forehead,looking very pleased with himself. "Not bad for an old brain,eh?" "Not bad atall!" cried the twins. "Thanks, Ajja!" They knewexactly how old Muttajji was!
Five minuteslater, the twins were racing homewards. "Muttajji, "they panted, rushing straight to her room, "did the MysoreMaharaja get his gold medal from King George V?" "Aaaaaan!"Muttajji said happily. "That's it! George! What clever childrenyou are!" "That means,Muttajji, that you were born in 1916! You are exactly 100* years oldtoday!"*(2016 - 1916 = 100)
"That'sgreat detective work, twins!" smiled Amma. "I think you -and Muttajji - deserve a special treat. A big, spongy one, with pinkicing, and a rose on top." "Hurrayyyyyy!"cheered the twins.
The GrandMaharaja-Maharani Party (and other fun stuff from Indian history)Remember all theimportant historical events Muttajji talked about in the story? Theyall really happened! Here is a little more information about them.
The GrandMaharaja-Maharani Party (1911) - When the British Emperor GeorgeV and his wife Queen Mary visited India for the first time, theyhosted a grand party for over 400 Indian kings and queens. It wascalled the Delhi Durbar. To feed 200,000 guests, bakeries put out20000 loaves of bread a day, and over 1000 cattle and sheep wereslaughtered for every meal! Many Indian rulers received gold medalsfrom the Emperor, including the Maharaja of Mysore, KrishnarajaWodeyar IV.
The CleanTrains (1925)  - On Feb 3, 1925, India's first electric train leftBombay's Victoria Terminus for Kurla station. With that, India becamethe 3rd country in Asia and only the 24th in the world to introducerailway electrification.The Dam ThatTamed The Kaveri (1932) -  The Kaveri river runs through southernKarnataka and Tamil Nadu. The river was always a blessing, keepingMysore fertile, but, like every other river, it used to flood in themonsoons and run dry in the summer.  All that changed when a dam wasbuilt across the river and the Krishna Raja Sagara (KRS) reservoircreated.  The reservoir still provides most of the drinking water forBangalore city.
Gandhiji's BigSpeech (1942) -  The 'Quit India Speech' was a speech made byGandhiji on 8 August 1942, at the Gowalia Tank Maidan in Bombay. Gandhiji asked people to fight against British rule not by usingviolence, but by disobeying their laws. Five years later, on August15, 1947, the non-violent war got the results Gandhiji wanted - theBritish left, and India became independent. Today, the Gowalia TankMaidan is called the August Kranti Maidan in memory of that peacefulrevolution.
Dear…well, you know who you are. And it’s not like you’re ever goingto see this letter.Misstold me that I had to be your mentor and show you around because youare a new student. I didn’t know what a ‘mentor’ is, so Ilooked it up in the dictionary. Anyway, she didn’t tell me anythingabout that.Ali and Gaurav and Sumi and Rani, they kept asking me about it whenwe were going home from school. I told them that I didn’t know whatthey were talking about, but that’s not true. How can I not know? See,you made me lie to my friends.Yourssincerely,Me
Hiagain,Masays that it is not good to stare at people, but I can see thateveryone stares at you. They stare at me too because I have to hangaround with you and be your ‘mentor’. Why did you come to ourschool? Why couldn’t you continue going to whatever school you wentto earlier?Doyou know what happened yesterday? Gaurav, Ali and two of theirfriends from Class VII cornered me after school to ask aboutyou-know-what. They took my bag and wouldn’t give it back. Thenthey threw it into the thicket by the side of the road and I had toscramble down into the mountainside to get it. I tore my shirt and Mawas angry with me. Thisis all your fault. Me
Hello,I keep telling them that they can ask you whatever they want to know. What’s the point of asking me? How am I supposed to know why you have that thing or how it works?Tobe really honest, I can’t say I’m not curious myself or that Idon’t have the same questions the others are asking me. Yes, Inoticed it the first day when you came into the classroom. I saw howyou did everything with one hand and how your left hand never moved.At first I couldn’t tell what the problem was. Then, when I camecloser, I saw that something wasn’t quite right. It looked weird,like it was covered in plastic or something. Then I thought it was atoy hand. It took me some time to understand. Also,I saw what happened at lunch.Seeyou,Me
Hello,Myoldest sister, the one who’s studying engineering in Delhi, calledtoday. I told her, “There’s a girl in my class and she has a fakehand,” and she said that the term is “prosthetic hand”.Listen,I have some advice for you. You may be new and all, but if you wantpeople to stop staring at you and talking about you, you have to stopstanding in the corner all the time. Why don’t you play with us?Why don’t you come on the swing? Everyone loves the swing. It’sbeen two weeks, and you can jolly well come by yourself. I am notgoing to be your minder for ever.SometimesI don’t know what to say to you.Me
Hiagain,Afterthe lunch incident that day, I’ve been watching you. I’m justcurious. Is it weird to have one hand? Is it only your hand or isyour entire arm fake, sorry, prosthetic? Today,Sumi, Gaurav and I walked to school together. They were playing agame they made up called One-Hand Challenge. The rule is, you have todo things with one hand. Like, packing your bag or buttoning yourshirt.
Sumi couldn’t tie her shoelaces and she forgot about it andtripped and fell. She got a cut on her chin. Miss saw it and, eventhough she put some  antiseptic cream on it, she scolded Sumi forbeing careless. “You can’t run around in the mountains with yourshoelaces untied. What will happen if you fall while going home orsomething?” I think adults worry too much.Yourstruly,Me
Hi,Doyou know what a coincidence is? It’s like when you talk aboutsomething and the same thing happens sometime later in a completelyunrelated way. In my last letter, I was telling you about Sumi andthe shoelaces, and then, today, I saw you tying your shoelaces. Wow,that was awesome! I think you did it faster than I can do it with twohands. If you were my friend, I would challenge you to ashoelace-tying race. Or no, maybe I would ask you to teach me how todo it with one hand.Ihave to confess, I did try to tie my shoelace with one hand when Igot home. But it’s impossible. How do you do it? Maybe I’ll askyou tomorrow.Curious,Me
Hi,So,after what you said, I’ve tried to do a lot of things with only onehand, but it’s so difficult! I still don’t get how you do it,like having a bath, wearing your clothes, packing your bag. Sincethat day at lunch, I did realize that you have to do some thingsdifferently, but it’s not like you don’t do almost everything therest of us do.Listen,I’m sorry about what I said earlier... about playing with us. Iguess you were just feeling shy. And also about coming on the swing.I tried and it’s hard to get your balance if you don’t hold itwith two hands. But you’re great in the jungle gym, even if youdon’t hang from the bars, and you can run really fast, even fasterthan Ali, who won the first prize at Sports Day. Bye,Me
Hello!Thatmovie was really funny, no? I laughed so much that my stomach hurtand it was like I was crying. I always like it when they show moviesin school. It means no classes.Lasttime, before you came to our school, they showed this movie about atiger cub who got lost. It was quite scary, mostly because it was atrue story. Later someone found it and managed to get it back to itsfamily. True stories like that are called documentaries, did you knowthat? Tiger cubs are cute, no? Last year, there was a puppy near ourhouse. It was very cute too, but it grew up and then it wasn’t socute any more.Gotto go now!Me
Hello,hello!Didyou know? I was so surprised when I saw you on the bus. I had no ideamy father worked in the same place as yours! But I’m so happy youcame for the office picnic, because last year when they took us,there were no other children my age and I got really bored.Okay,I’m really tired, so I’m going now. See you in school tomorrow.Me
Hi,Ithink I should warn you, Principal Sir becomes slightly insanewhenever Annual Day comes along. He might yell at you — he yells ateveryone — so don’t take it personally. My ma says that he’sunder a lot of pressure because our Annual Day performance reflectson him. I’m not sure what that means, but he does look stressedout. Did you see his hair? It was like he touched a loose wire andgot an electric shock! Though I think it was very mean of Rani to puta frog in his chair.Okay,I’m going now before he catches me writing this letter!Me
Hey,Yournew hand is so cool! No offence, but the old one was a bit boring. Itwas just… there. The new one is like magic, and you can move thefingers and grip with it! I hope you didn’t mind that I asked toshake hands. I just said it before I could think. Maybe tomorrow wecan do some experiments to find out if you can lift stuff with it.Oh!I just realized, the last couple of letters I wrote to you, I didn’tmention your prosthetic hand at all. It’s like I forgot all aboutit and wanted to tell you so many other things. The funny thing is,I’m not that curious about your hand any more. I don’t know why. Yourfriend,Me

Chicken and Millipede were very close friends. In some ways they were very similar; they both loved sport and were very competitive. But in other ways they were very different. Millipede loved to joke around and make people laugh. She was able to do many things at once, juggling tasks with her many legs. Chicken was more serious. She was good at taking others under her wing and making them feel safe and cared for. But she also had a terrible temper!
One day they decided to play a friendly game of soccer. Chicken was a fast runner and an excellent dribbler. She also had a powerful kick and could score goals from far away. But Millipede had something Chicken could never compete with - hundreds of legs! Millipede ran circles around poor Chicken, scoring goal after goal. Chicken got angrier and angrier. Watch out, Millipede!
"Let's have a penalty shoot-out," said Chicken, hoping that this would prevent Millipede from using her legs to dribble around her."Sure thing!" said Millipede confidently.First Millipede was goal keeper. Chicken scored only one goal. Then it was Chicken's turn to defend the goal.
Millipede kicked the ball and scored. Millipede juggled the ball and scored. Millipede headed the ball and scored. Millipede tapped the ball and scored.Chicken grew angrier by the minute. "This is unfair," she thought, "Millipede should only be able to use two of her legs. She is cheating!"While Chicken was busy thinking her angry thoughts, Millipede slyly kicked the ball around her and through the goalposts. Millipede scored five goals!
Chicken was furious that she had lost."I want a rematch," she demanded, "and this time you can only use two of your legs!"Millipede started laughing because her friend was making such a fuss. "What a sore loser you are!" she said, "Why didn't you use your wings to flap the ball into the goal, or your feathers to blow it over my head? You lost fair and square, my friend!"
"You see," said Millipede, "soccer is really all about strategy. You need to use your brain and have a plan.""Are you telling me I don't have any brains?" shrieked Chicken. "How dare you!"But before Millipede could answer, Chicken opened up her beak and swallowed her.
As Chicken was walking home, she met Mother Millipede. Usually Chicken loved to see her friend's mother. Mother Millipede told wonderful stories and baked the most delicious leaf cakes. But today Chicken marched right on, hoping Mother Millipede would not recognize her."Hello dear," Mother Millipede called, “Have you seen my child?” Chicken didn't say anything. Mother Millipede was worried. "Chicken is acting very strangely!" she thought.
Then Mother Millipede heard a tiny voice. “Help me, Mom!” cried the voice. Mother Millipede looked  around and listened carefully. "Where is that voice coming from?" she asked. "Have you got someone inside your stomach, Chicken?"Chicken looked around sheepishly. She didn't know what to do."Who have you eaten?" asked Mother Millipede. "Don't tell me you've eaten my precious baby!"
Mother Millipede shouted, “Use your special power my child!”Millipedes can make a badsmell and a terrible taste. Chicken began to feel ill."I don't feel so well," she moaned. "I need to go home and lie in my bed."
Chicken burped. Then she swallowed and spat. Then she sneezed and coughed.  Millipede tasted disgusting!Meanwhile, Mother Millipede stood beside her, cheering. "Well done, my darling!" she shouted, "Keep on working that special magic! You'll be out in no time."
Chicken coughed and coughed until Millipede came out. "Hooray!" shouted Millipede, "I'm free! I escaped!"Mother Millipede was relieved to see her child alive and well. "Come quickly," she whispered, and her and Millipede crawled quickly away. They climbed and climbed until they reached the top of a tall tree where they could hide.
From that time on, all chickens and millipedes have been enemies.
This is Khalai. She is seven years old. Her name means 'the good one.'
Khalai wakes up and talks to the orange tree. "Please orange tree, grow big and give us lots of ripe oranges."
Khalai walks to school. On the way,  she talks to the grass. "Please grass,  grow greener and don't dry up."
Khalai sees flowers. "Please flowers,  keep blooming so I can put you in my hair."
Khalai talks to the tree at her school. "Please tree,  put out big branches so we can read under your shade."
Khalai talks to the hedge round her school. "Please,  grow strong and protect us from bad people."
When Khalai returns home,  she visits the orange tree. "Are your oranges ripe yet?" Khalai asks the tree.
"The oranges are still green," sighs Khalai.  "I will see you tomorrow orange tree," says Khalai. "Perhaps then,  you will have a ripe orange for me!"

My friend Kiki and I walk home from school.
One day, a man followed us.
His teeth were brown. He had pimples on the face.
When we looked at him, he shouted at us angrily.
Kiki managed to run away.
They threw me into a van.
They put me in a dark room. My hands were tied.
A man said, "Eat this food. The journey is long."
As I ate, the man smoked a cigarette.
Suddenly, the other men came in pulling my friend Kiki.
We heard the men arguing and shouting in the next room.
Kiki said, "We must escape. Our parents cannot pay them."
We pulled the timber from the window until we saw light.
Kiki climbed out and ran to get help.
The men rushed into the room. The leader was angry.
They went back to the other room and continued arguing.
I heard a voice saying, "Don't be afraid. Police are here."
They were shouting and making noise. I heard some gunshots.
A policewoman said, "Everything is over. You are safe now."
After that day, Kiki and I were more careful.

In the swamp on the far side of the Far Forest, lived Sniffles, the Crocodile. Sniffles was always crying big crocodile tears or going sniff... sniff... Even his mom was quite tired of him and would say, “Stop snivelling and crying, start behaving like a crocodile. Go hunt for your food.”
But Sniffles would burst into tears at the thought of eating another animal. So mom and dad had to feed Sniffles every day.
Sniffles did not want to be a crocodile. 'I am so ugly,' he thought, bursting into tears. He did not even want to live like crocodiles do. His best friend was Punch, a golden yellow butterfly. And Punch wanted to be big and strong. So Punch always had her feeler curled into a fist saying, “Look out! I will punch you in the mouth.”
They made a very funny pair. Sniffles swimming with Punch perched on his head. The other crocodiles would laugh and make fun of them. That did not bother Sniffles. He continued crying, sniffling and being friends with Punch.
One sunny afternoon, Punch settled herself near Sniffles’ ear and told him, “I have seen two men come this way with guns, they want to kill crocodiles for their skins.”“Don’t these men have skins of their own?” asked a puzzled Sniffles.“I don’t know Sniffles,” replied Punch. “Tell the other crocodiles and hide.”
“But Punch, they might shoot you. Oh! What will I do,” cried Sniffles sobbing loudly.“People catch butterflies with nets and pin them on a board, my grandaunt told me,” said Punch and flew away.
The other crocodiles heard Sniffles crying and shouting, “Men coming to kill us. Hide ... Hurry ... Hide.” At first the crocodiles did not believe Sniffles, but then they heard the men’s footsteps. The crocodiles went deep into the river and left some rotten logs floating on the water. The men shot at the logs which looked like crocodiles from afar. The men could not see any crocodiles, only hundreds of butterflies that flew into their faces and hair.
Shaking their heads and trying to brush off the butterflies they said, “There are no crocodiles here, we will bring nets and catch the butterflies.” And off they went. All the crocodiles got together and said, “Thank you, Punch.”“Thank you, butterflies.”
The next day Sniffles saw men with nets. He remembered Punch telling him about nets. “Punch, the nets! Come here quick! The men with the nets have come.” All the crocodiles came on the river bank. The butterflies settled on the backs and heads of the crocodiles.
A few of the crocodiles made a circle around the men as they came close. The crocodiles snapped their jaws. Sniffles was in front, gnashing his teeth and whipping his tail around most menacingly.
The men were so frightened that they took to their heels and ran right out of the swamp. The other crocodiles were very proud of Sniffles, as he had acted like a real crocodile. Now Sniffles was also proud to be one.
All the butterflies flew around the crocodiles, fluttering their wings.“Thank you, Sniffles, Thank you, crocodiles.”“It is all right,” said Sniffles shyly. “That is what friends are for, to take care of each other.”
“We have milk, eggs,bread  and vegetables in the fridge,” says Ma.“I’ll cook dinner!” says Pa.“Pa, can you make fried rice?” asks Tara. “Fried rice,” Madhav echoes.
As soon as Tara, Madhav, Ma and Pa enter the house, they know that something is wrong. Very wrong."Chee! What’s that smell?” cries Tara.“A MONSTER!” yells Madhav.
It is hot, dark and stinky. The whole house smells!Where is the smell coming from?
Ma opens the fridge. Everyone covers their noses and mouths.“Hmm, it’s warm inside and the light is off,” says Ma, sticking her arm into the fridge. “What happened?” asks Tara. "The fridge stopped working some time ago," Pa explains. "Without the cold air, everything spoiled,” says Ma, glumly.“Has the milk gone bad?” asks Tara.“Yes, can you smell how sour it is?” asks Ma.“Milk needs to be kept cold to stay fresh,” says Pa.
“Has the bread gone bad?” asks Tara.“Yes, do you see that green stuff? That’s mould,” says Pa, “It grows on the bread.”“Fuzzy,” says Madhav, curiously.“Don’t touch it,” says Pa. “You’ll fall sick if you eat it.”
“Have the vegetables gone bad too?” asks Tara, sadly.“Yes, they’re rotten,” says Ma. “We can’t eat them.”
Invisible MonstersTara and Madhav thought there was an invisible monster in their house. While there was no monster to be found, they were right about there being something invisible!When food goes ‘bad’—meaning it cannot be eaten by human beings—it’s because something invisible has begun to eat the food. These invisible beings are called microbes.Microbes aren’t totally invisible: they’re just very, very, very tiny (tinier than the tiniest insect you’ve ever seen). You need a machine called a microscope to be able to see them. They look something like this.
It was a little girl who first saw the mysterious shape in the distance.
As the shape moved closer, the girl saw that it was a heavily pregnant woman.
Shy but brave, the little girl moved nearer to the woman. "We must keep her with us," the little girl's people decided. "We'll keep her and her child safe."
The child was soon on its way. Everyone wanted to help. "Push!" "Bring blankets!" "Water!" "Puuuuussssshhh!"
But when they saw the baby, everyone jumped back in shock. "A donkey!"
Everyone began to argue. "We said we would keep mother and child safe, and that's what we'll do," said some. "But they will bring us bad luck!" said others.
And so the woman found herself alone again. She wondered what to do with this awkward child. She wondered what to do with herself.
But finally she had to accept that he was her child and she was his mother. Now, if the child had stayed that same, small size, everything might have been different.
But the donkey child grew and grew until he could no longer fit on his mother's back. And no matter how hard he tried, he could not behave like a human being. His mother was often tired and frustrated. Sometimes she made him do work meant for animals.
Confusion and anger built up inside Donkey. He couldn't do this and he couldn't do that. He couldn't be like this and he couldn't be like that. He became so angry that, one day, he kicked his mother to the ground.
Donkey was filled with shame. He ran away as far and as fast as he could.
By the time he stopped running, it was night, and Donkey was lost. "Hee haw?" he whispered to the darkness. "Hee Haw?" it echoed back. He was all alone. Curling himself into a tight ball, he fell into a deep and troubled sleep.
Donkey woke up to find a strange old man staring down at him. He looked into the old man's eyes and started to feel a twinkle of hope.
Donkey went to stay with the old man, who taught him many different ways to survive. Donkey listened and learned, and so did the old man. They helped each other, and they laughed together.
One morning, the old man asked Donkey to carry him to the top of a mountain.
High up amongst the clouds they fell asleep. Donkey dreamed that his mother was sick and calling to him.
When Donkey woke up, the clouds had disappeared along with his friend, the old man.
Donkey finally knew what to do.
Donkey found his mother, alone and mourning her lost child. They stared at each other for a long time. And then hugged each other very hard.
The donkey child and his mother have grown together and found many ways of living together. Slowly,  all around them, other families have started to settle.
Once, a rabbit thought to itself, "I have been eating raw carrots so far...
"Let me cook and eat it. "
"How do I cook?"
"Let me ask for help in this house"
But, there was a dog that started barking . He also chased the rabbit.
"Oh dear! What do I do now?" thought the rabbit.
He kept the carrots in the sun. The carrots didn't  cook.
He cooked the carrots in the fire. The carrots became too bitter!
"How do I cook and eat this? " Thought the rabbit furiously to himself.
He found a tortoise shell.
He gathered twigs.
He also found stones!
The rabbit lit the stove.
He also invited his friends to eat.
Everybody enjoyed eating the finely cooked carrots!
Hamisi needs a new school uniform. His dad takes him to the market.
Hamisi sees a boy wearing a beautiful shirt. "That is a very fine shirt," thinks Hamisi.
"Dad, I wish I had a shirt like the one that boy has," says Hamisi.
"Look, there are those beautiful shirts," says Hamisi. "Dad, please buy one for me."
"Hamisi, I have to buy your uniform," says dad.
"I do not have enough money for that shirt," says dad.
Hamisi's dad buys the uniform. He is surprised when he gets the change. He has enough money left over to buy a shirt for Hamisi!
It is Hamisi's lucky day! Which shirt will he choose?
There was a big dark jungle. There were lots of trees and a narrow path. Many animals and birds lived here.
One day, all the animals came together.“Did you hear?” asked Tota, the parrot.“Yes,” said Hirni, the deer.“What?” asked Darpok, the rabbit.“We have a school in the jungle,”answered Zhoola, the monkey.Mota, the elephant wondered, “Hmph?”Lamboo, the giraffe said, “Oh, good!”Dheema, the snail squealed, “Hurry, let’s go!”
Tota, the parrot flew ahead. Zhoola, the monkey jumped from tree to tree. Poorakha, the python slithered fast. “Here!” shouted Tota. “Can you read?”“It is upside down, I think,” said Zhoolahanging by the branch. Poorakha concluded, “Hisssss. No one can read.”
Soon, all the other friends joined them.Lamboo looked over the tree. “No one here,” he said.Zhoola repeated, “No one here.”Tota proposed, “Look carefully!”Pilloo, the little bear declared, “I found a room!”
“I found a swing,” announced Dheema.“What are these blocks?” Darpok wanted to know.“What is this?” was Zhoola’s question.Poorakha explained, “I believe, this is a pencil.”
Mota and Lamboo found a classroom.They called the others, “Look, what is this?”Everyone came with school bags. They began shouting, “Teacher! Teacher!Where is our teacher?” No one knew.
Then they heard a roar. They heard a loud roar. They heard a louder roar. Poorakha was worried. Dheema was scared. Tota hid behind the board. Lamboo and Zhoola were puzzled. Who is this? “Hup!” said Zhoola the monkey. No one spoke.
Who is this? “Hup!” said Zhoola the monkey. No one spoke. They all looked at the teacher. Up and down carefully. Then they looked at one another. The teacher turned to write on the black board.
“Jump,” said Zhoola.“Fly!” said Tota. Thump, thump, thump ran Mota.“Run, run, run fast,” screamed Dheema.“Bhagoooo,” they all shouted together.When the teacher turned... there was no one in the class.
Once upon a time, there lived a happy family.
The children never fought with each other. They helped their parents at home and in the fields.
But they were not allowed to go near a fire.
They had to do all their work during the night.Because they weremade of wax!
But one of the boys longed to go out in the sunlight.
One day the longing was too strong. His brother and sister warned him.
But it was too late! Hemelted in the hot sun.
The wax children cried to see their brother melting away.
But they made a plan. They shaped the lump of melted wax into a bird.
They took their bird brother up to a high mountain.
And as the sun rose,he flew away, singing in the morning light.
“What’s for supper?” asked Sam.“It’s a surprise”, said Mama, putting a big pot on the stove.
She added a jug of water. Sam wasworried. “Are wehaving water for supper?” he wailed.“It’s a surprise. Wait and see.” replied Mama.
“Can I help?” asked Sam. “I could stir.”
“You are still a bit short,” said Mama.“The pot might fallover. But you can help me by fetchingthings.”
“Can you bring me an onion, please.”“This doesn’t smell very nice.”
“They will taste nice once they are cooked.”
“Now I need some tomatoes. No, that is an apple.The tomatoes are also round and red, but you will find them in the fridge.”
“Can you bring me potatoes.They are round and brown.”
“Is supper ready yet?”
“If you are hungry you can eat the apple while you wait.”
