But they were not allowed to go near a fire.
They had to do all their work during the night. Because they were made of wax!
But one of the boys longed to go out in the sunlight.
One day the longing was too strong. His brother and sister warned him.
But it was too late! He melted in the hot sun.
The wax children cried to see their brother melting away.
But they made a plan. They shaped the lump of melted wax into a bird.
They took their bird brother up to a high mountain.
And as the sun rose, he flew away, singing in the morning light.
Why is the baby crying?
I think she is hungry.
Why is the boy sad?
I think he is missing his father.
Why is the girl happy?
She has a new dress.
Why is the old man laughing?
He read a good joke.
Why is the lady smiling?
Her children are reading quietly.
What is this lady feeling?I think she is feeling shy.
Heeeee! There is a beautiful cow at home.
It has only one horn,  and no tail.
It is fat,  with a big stomach.
It is a powerful cow.
The shepherd loves this cow the most.
When the other cattle graze,  this one eats alone.
This cow is a fighter. Other cows leave it alone.
If you met such a cow,  what would you do?
Keke sat on her swing. She loved her swing. It was the best swing at her school.
Keke moved slowly on her swing. Backwards and forwards,  backwards and forwards. When Keke moved,  her swing went faster and faster. Soon she was right at the top.
Keke looked down at the ground. She was very high up. "Aeei!" she called.  "Look how high I am!"
She was happy to be so high. She could see the whole village. She was nearly as high as birds flying over the cornfields.
After a while Keke wanted to come down. The swing would not stop. "Oh,  oh,  oh," she called. "I don't know how to stop this swing!"
The swing went on and on. Up and down,  up and down. Keke was frightened. "Where will this swing take me? I might go up to the moon. I must get off!" she cried.
So,  Keke let go of the swing. She fell down,  down,  down.
"Oh,  oh,  oh!" cried the other children.  Keke fell onto the ground. She hurt her head. "Eeeeh,  eeeeh,  eeeh," she cried.
The other children were very worried. Keke did not know what to do. "Eeeeh,  eeeeh,  eeeh," she cried.
The children called their teacher. "M'e Mpho, please come!" they called. "Keke fell off the swing. She has hurt her head."
M'e Mpho ran to the swing. She picked up Keke and kissed her head. Keke smiled,  "That's better. I will not go on that swing by myself again," she said. "I never want to go to the moon."
"Next time I will be with you on your swing,  Keke," said M'e Mpho. "We can go to the moon together!"

One day, Chameleon challenged Rabbit to a race to see who was faster.
Rabbit accepted and said, "You are so slow! You start with one foot, then stop and start with the other." He boasted, "I'm going to leave you far behind. You'll never catch me!"
They invited all the animals to come and watch the race.
Chameleon and Rabbit lined up and waited for the signal.
As the race began, Chameleon jumped onto Rabbit's tail.
The animals laughed and laughed.Rabbit did not realise that Chameleon was on his tail.
Hearing the noise, Rabbit skidded to a stop. Chameleon jumped off Rabbit's tail."Hey, watch where you're going! It's about time you got here," Chameleon shouted at Rabbit.
Rabbit was amazed. He started running again.He did not know that Chameleon had once again jumped onto his tail.
As Rabbit approached the finish line, the animals saw that Chameleon was still on Rabbit's tail. They clapped and laughed.Rabbit heard the noise and thought that Chameleon had already arrived ahead of him.
When they arrived at the finish line, Chameleon jumped off Rabbit's tail. "Don't step on me! I got here first!" Chameleon shouted at Rabbit.
Rabbit stormed off in a rage. Chameleon stayed to receive the prize, and Rabbit lost.
Little Ant loved to read. Little Ant was often teased. “Ants don’t read. Ants must feed. Ants collect the food they need.”
Little Ant would read all day, he’d read and read the day away.
The other ants took what they found to store for winter underground.
His mum and dad got really mad, and Little Ant felt really bad.
In autumn when the leaves fall down.
The ants must keep food underground.
The Queen wants food to fill the store, so all the ants must work some more.
Little Ant begins to shout about a place he read about. “A restaurant is what we need, a place where people go to feed. It says so in the books I read.”
The ants go marching one by one. They march into the setting sun.
And Little Ant said “Hey, there’s one!”
The ants go marching one by one, carrying a burger, carrying a bun.
When they return the Queen is glad. The stores are full. They cheer like mad.
Ant gets hugs from mum and dad.
His baby sister takes his hand “Now I think I understand.” “The way you love to read a book … Makes me want to take alook.”
Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Tselane. After her father died, she lived alone with her mother. One day, her mother decided that they would move to another village to start a new life. Tselane did not want to leave her old village and she started to cry.
Her mother was scared to leave her daughter alone because giants lived in the caves nearby that village. But Tselane cried so much that her mother finally agreed that she could stay behind.
Tselane's mother told her that she would bring food every day. She said, "I will sing a song so that you know it's me. Don't open the door for anyone else, my child." She sang the song: "Tselane my child! Tselane my child! Come out and eat your porridge! Come out and eat your porridge!"
The next morning Tselane's mother came to the house with food. She sang their special song. Tselane opened the door and took her mother's delicious food. Then her mother kissed her and went back to her new home.
A giant was hiding in the bushes, watching and listening to Tselane and her mother! After Tselane switched off her light that night, she heard a deep voice singing her mother's song outside the door. "Tselane my child! Come out and eat your porridge!" sang the giant. "Go away! You are not my mother! You are a giant!" shouted Tselane.
The giant walked away disappointed and disappeared into the caves. Every morning and every evening, Tselane's mother brought her food. Every morning and every evening, the giant also came. But each time Tselane sent him away. She recognised his deep voice as he sang her mother's song.
One day the giant had an idea. "I can change my voice to resemble that of Tselane's mother!" he said to himself. He made a fire and threw a round smooth stone into the flames. When the stone was very hot and red, he took it out of the fire and swallowed it! "Kudutlu!" went the hot stone down the throat of the giant.
The giant started singing. He jumped for joy when he heard his voice sounding as sweet as that of Tselane's mother! The next day, the giant went to Tselane's house early in the morning. When he got to the door of the house, he sang: "Tselane my child! Tselane my child! Come out and eat your porridge! Come out and eat your porridge!"
Tselane was excited to hear her mother's voice. She opened the door, and there was the giant! She tried to close the door but the giant was too quick. He grabbed Tselane and threw her into a sack.
The happy giant walked back to his cave. "What a beautiful day! If only I had traditional beer, it would go so well with my dinner tonight," he said to himself.
A little later in the morning, Tselane's mother came as usual to bring her daughter food. She sang her song, but Tselane did not come out. She sang her song again, but still Tselane did not come out. After singing for the third time, she kicked the door open. Tselane was nowhere to be found. Her mother realised what had happened, and she quickly made a plan.
She poured some beer into a big calabash, put it on her head, and walked down to the caves. "Good evening, giant!" called Tselane's mother. The giant smelled the delicious smell of traditional beer and opened the door. Tselane's mother said, "I was passing through and I heard you singing so beautifully. I am on my way to another village for a party."
"Let me pour you some beer," said Tselane's mother. The giant was not going to let the opportunity of drinking traditional beer pass him by! Tselane's mother went into his cave. The giant drank the beer in one great gulp. Tselane's mother gave him more and more, and more, until the calabash was empty. The giant was soon so drunk that he fell asleep on the floor.
As soon as Tselane's mother heard the giant's loud snores, she opened the sack lying in the cave. Tselane jumped out of the sack, and they ran home as fast as they could. From then on Tselane stayed with her mother at the new village. They lived happily and were never again bothered by giants.

Long, long ago there was a king called Kayanja. He lived in a palace with his queen and their daughter, Princess Apenyo. Princess Apenyo was such a beautiful young woman that every man wanted to marry her. But king Kayanja demanded a very high bride price for the princess.
Near king Kayanja's palace lived a chief called Aludah the Great. He was called "the Great" because everybody in the neighbourhood obeyed him, and he was very violent to anyone who disobeyed him! Chief Aludah's wife had recently died of malaria, and he wanted another wife.
So the fat old chief went to king Kayanja to offer bride wealth for the young princess. While the two men were discussing the price, the maid Kakembo overheard their conversation. Maid Kakembo was very close to princess Apenyo.
Chief Aludah agreed to give half of his wealth to king Kayanja, including a needle, which was also part of the bride price. Preparations were made in secret for the wedding between chief Aludah and princess Apenyo. The king knew that his daughter would not be happy with this decision.
One week before the royal wedding day, maid Kakembo approached Apenyo. "My dear Princess,  your father has organised your wedding with chief Aludah, and it will take place in one week."
Princess Apenyo was shocked and at first didn't know what to do. Then she thought, "I will never marry chief Aludah, that fat old man. Never! I must hurry to Trevor and see what he can do before it's too late." Trevor was princess Apenyo's boyfriend.
That night Apenyo crept out of the palace. If her father discovered where she was going he would be very angry. She ran through the thick, dark forest over rocks and shrubs. When finally she arrived at Trevor's house she was tired and thirsty.
"My love, why have you run all this long distance alone and at such a time of night?" asked Trevor. He fetched water for her and allowed her to rest. Trevor could not settle down while he waited for Apenyo to talk.
"My dear princess, what is the problem?" asked Trevor. Apenyo breathed heavily and said sadly, "My father wants to marry me off to chief Aludah the Great. But I can't marry that horrible man. Trevor, I want to marry you even if you are poor. I am ready to suffer. I love you."
"But princess, I have nothing to pay as your bride price, you know I'm a poor boy," cried Trevor. Apenyo replied, "I know, but it's only you I can get married to." She thought for a while and said, "Let's go to Kategga the boatman and ask him to take us across the river. That way we can escape and my father will never find us."
Back at the palace, king Kayanja had discovered princess Apenyo's disappearance. He ordered his subjects to search for her everywhere. The king's guards, soldiers, and everyone else searched, but they couldn't find the princess. They went back to the king and told him that Apenyo was nowhere to be seen. "Then go back and search again," King Kayanja ordered. He was very annoyed.
As Princess Apenyo and Trevor hurried to the riverbank, dark clouds began gathering in the sky. A heavy storm was coming.
Kategga the boatman was mooring his boat when the young couple approached him. Trevor asked Kategga to row them across the river. Kategga refused to accept, explaining that a heavy storm was fast approaching, and it would be too dangerous.
Trevor insisted and explained to Kategga why they must cross. He then put his hand deep in his pocket and took out a cowrie shell to give to Kategga. When Kategga heard their story and saw the beautiful shell, he felt sorry for them. He agreed to row them across the river in spite of the weather.
When King Kayanja and chief Aludah reached the bank, they saw the three people in the boat. They realised that the young lovers had escaped. Heavy winds rocked the boat and Kategga could no longer control it. King Kayanja shouted, "Apenyo, please come back! I forgive you. I will never punish you or Trevor."
But, it was too late. The boat tipped over and the three people were thrown into the wild water. They all drowned. After that day, everyone in king Kayanja's kingdom could marry anyone they wanted, rich or poor.

Once upon a time there lived two friends,  Tortoise and Snake.
On day Tortoise said to Snake,  "Let us go and swim." "Alright,  but I don't know to swim," answered Snake. "I will teach you," replied Tortoise.
They went to a swimming pool. "Who will enter the water first?" asked Tortoise. "You will,  and I will watch you," said Snake.
Tortoise entered the swimming pool. Snake observed from the steps.
After some time,  Snake entered the pool as Tortoise gave instructions.
Tortoise and Snake swam in the shallow end of the pool.
They started floating on the water.
As they were floating,  Tortoise started swimming backstroke. While imitating Tortoise,  Snake could not propel himself and started drowning.
On realising that Snake had disappeared,  Tortoise hurriedly went under water and rescued the life of the snake.
As soon as Tortoise got out of the water,  he turned Snake upside-down in order to get rid of the water that Snake swallowed.
Finally,  Tortoise used the mouth-to-mouth method to remove more water.
Everyone knows that the elephant has a very long nose.
But a long time ago, the elephant's nose was short and fat. Like a shoe in the middle of its face.
One day a baby elephant was born. She was curious about everything. She had a question for every animal.
She was curious about Giraffe. "Why do you have a long neck?" she asked.
She was curious about Rhino. "Why does your horn have a sharp point?"
She was curious about Hippo. "Why do you have red eyes?" she asked.
And she was VERY curious about Crocodile. "What does Crocodile eat for dinner?" she asked.
"Never ask a question like that!" said her mother. Then she walked off, frowning.
Quickly Crow flew down to Baby Elephant. "Follow me to the river. There you will see what Crocodile eats for dinner," squawked Crow.
So the baby elephant followed Crow down to the river.
She pushed through the reeds and stood on the bank. She looked into the water. Where was Crocodile?
"Hello," said a stone near the river bank. "Hello," said Baby Elephant. "Can you tell me what Crocodile eats for dinner?" she asked.
"Bend down and I will tell you," said the stone. "Lower, lower," said the stone. So Baby Elephant bent down lower, and lower.
Then suddenly, "Snap!" Baby Elephant's nose was caught in Crocodile's jaws. "Crocodile will eat you for dinner!" squawked Crow, and flew away.
Baby Elephant sat back on her strong legs and pulled. She pulled, and pulled. But Crocodile did not let go of her nose.
Baby Elephant's nose stretched, and stretched, and stretched. Then, "Thud!" she fell on her back.
Crocodile sunk back into the water. He was cross about losing his dinner.
Baby Elephant looked at her nose. It was stretched very long. She could not see where it ended!
Her nose was so long she could pick fruit from high branches.
Her nose was so long she could shower her back with water. From that day, all elephants had long and useful trunks.

One day,  Rabbit was walking by the riverside.
Hippo was there too,  going for a stroll and eating some nice green grass.
Hippo didn't see that Rabbit was there and she accidentally stepped on Rabbit's foot. Rabbit started screaming at Hippo,  "You Hippo! Can't you see that you're stepping on my foot?"
Hippo apologised to Rabbit,  "I'm so sorry. I didn't see you. Please forgive me!" But Rabbit wouldn't listen and he shouted at Hippo,  "You did that on purpose! Someday,  you'll see! You're going to pay!"
Rabbit went to find Fire and said,  "Go,  burn Hippo when she comes out of the water to eat grass. She stepped on me!"  Fire answered,  "No problem,  Rabbit,  my friend. I'll do just what you ask."
Later,  Hippo was eating grass far from the river when,  "Whoosh!" Fire burst into flame. The flames began to burn Hippo's hair.
Hippo started to cry and ran for the water. All her hair was burned off by the fire. Hippo kept crying,  "My hair has burned in the fire! My hair is all gone! My beautiful hair!"
Rabbit was happy that Hippo's hair was burned. And to this day,  for fear of fire,  the hippo never goes far from the water.
The trendy cool caterpillar had a collection of trendy cool boots. There were so many he had to store them on shelves!
The caterpillar had so many legs that he needed so many boots. Sometimes he slipped when he walked. It took him an hour to put on his boots, so he would leave them on all day long!
Dragonfly and ant saw the caterpillar coming. They couldn't believe how many boots he had. They thought he was weird.
"Why do you wear so many boots?" said the ant. "Is there something wrong with your feet?""I like to look trendy and cool," said the caterpillar.
"Don't you worry that others will stare at you?" said the insect."I like the way I look," said the caterpillar.
The caterpillar carried on proudly, with his clinking and clanking boots making sounds through the soil.
But when he fell over, it was a disaster. With nobody to help, the trendy cool caterpillar had to struggle and stumble and get himself onto his feet, one by one.But the more he fell, the more he learned how to stay upright.
"One day he'll get over it and be a real caterpillar, showing his feet," said dragonfly. "It's just a phase. He'll come around to our way of thinking."
But caterpillar knew that one day he would not need boots, because he would be a butterfly.  He learned to walk his own way, and try his own style, despite what others said or thought. He felt free. And he was a very trendy, cool and happy caterpillar, who occasionally fell.

Long time ago, there lived an orphan boy called Pasitau. Pasitau's parents were killed by robbers when he was only six months old. As the villagers mourned the death of Pasitau's parents, they wondered what would become of the young boy.
After the burial, Sausau, the village headman called a meeting. Sausau was respected and feared at the same time because of the way he dressed and talked. His hair was long and fell on his back. It was believed that Sausau lived in the forest long before trees were cut down and houses were built.
During the meeting, Lokeyokoni, a very rich villager, adopted Pasitau. Lokeyokoni had many sons and daughters. The daughters helped their mother with household chores while the sons went out to graze their father's big herd of cattle.
Pasitau grew up in this family and was very happy. He was loved and he loved everybody. He enjoyed grazing the animals in the fields.
Pasitau loved one particular cow so much that he gave it the name 'Sitau'. Sitau was the oldest cow in the whole herd. For this reason, the owner valued it a lot.
One day, when the boys were out grazing the animals, it started raining and they had to shelter under a tree. The rain fell for many hours until it was dark. When it eventually stopped raining, the boys went to collect the animals and take them home but there were no animals to be seen.
They were afraid of what their father would do to them if they arrived home without the animals. When they could not trace the cattle, two boys decided to go to their uncle's home while two others went to their aunt's place. Pasitau decided to continue looking for the animals till he found them. He had no uncle or aunt to run to.
Pasitau followed all the tracks that he knew while singing the name of his favourite cow. This is how the song went: Piii pi Sitau! Piii pi Sitau! Chaka akula chi! Chaka orete chi!
Pasitau went on singing the song throughout the night. He stepped on the cow dung but it was cold. He then stepped on the urine but it was cold as well. Pasitau did not give up.
At dawn, Pasitau reached a small village and found the animals in the care of the village headman. He pleaded with the headman to let him lead the animals home, but the headman refused.
Frustrated, Pasitau started singing his song as he turned to go home. It was then that Sitau, the oldest cow, heard Pasitau. Sitau raised her ears and started following Pasitau. All the animals broke from the enclosure and followed Pasitau. He lead them home.
When they reached home, villagers were waiting because they had heard Pasitau's voice from far. They all sang songs praising Pasitau. Lokeyokoni thanked Pasitau and bought him a red bag for carrying books to school. And that is how Pasitau started going to school.
Khayanga lived with her parents happily until they died when she was ten years old.
Khayanga was taken in by Rosa,  a distant relative. Rosa was kind to Khayanga, but she was old,  frail and poor.
Khayanga often visited her parents' graves to tell them of her misery.
One day when she visited, she received a gift. It was a very special Gourd which appeared from her parents' graves.
The Gourd sang a beautiful and soothing song. Khayanga recognised the voice as that of her late mother. It went like this.
Khayanga carried her special Gourd everywhere. With her Gourd, Khayanga felt her parents' presence and protection.
One day,  something bad happened to her special Gourd. It broke when she was fetching water in the river. Khayanga's heart broke as well.
Khayanga held the pieces of the broken Gourd in her small hands and sang:
Khayanga heard her mother's voice saying to her: "Our child,  pick up the pieces that are left. Fetch water with them and wash your feet. When you finish washing, close your eyes." Khayanga obeyed and suddenly, the broken Gourd became whole once again.
Khayanga continued to carry her Gourd everywhere she went. Wherever she passed, people whispered to each other, "What type of gourd is this?" With her special Gourd, Khayanga received everything she needed.
With the special Gourd, Khayanga knew that her parents were watching over her. Nothing bad could happen to her.

Chipego sometimes earns K80.00 a week in pocket money. He spends most of the pocket money on books at the second-hand book shop in his village.So how does Chipego earn enough pocket money for these books? Read on to find out.
Meet Pendo, the family's milking cow. She produces over 20 litres of milk per day. Chipego's father sells the milk.A cow needs food and water, and time to graze in the field. So each day after school, Chipego helps with this work. Chipego's father gives him pocket money for the work he does. And it is this money that Chipego saves to buy books each week.
First, Chipego gives Pendo a bunch of carrots. He gives her exactly eight carrots a day. Each day he picks the carrots from his father's vegetable garden, enough for a day at a time.You can work it out. You will find that Pendo eats nearly 60 carrots a week. Can you tell exactly how many?
After that, Chipego takes Pendo to graze in the fields. His father warned him to watch the time and give Pendo not  more than three quarters of an hour to graze.Pendo usually starts grazing at about14:15 hrs, so that Chipego can take her back to the milking shed at 15 hours. In winter when it gets dark earlier, Chipego may start grazing earlier, around 13:30 hrs.
Next Chipego gives Pendo water. Without water Pendo won't produce milk, no matter how much Chipego feeds her. Chipego fetches buckets of water from the village pump because there isn't one nearby.Pendo's trough holds about 30 litres of water. Chipego's bucket only holds 5 litres. So to fill the trough Chipego has to make many trips. Can you work out how many trips he has to make?
Then, Chipego takes Pendo to his father to get her daily 12 kg bag of grain. Chipego calculates that's almost 90 kg a week.Each bag costs K39.00. Chipego works out the cost of grain for each week. First he works out the cost of 7 bags at K40.00, which makes K280.00 Then he subtracts K7.00 to get K273.00 "That's over K1 000 a month!" Chipego estimates. Is he correct?
Chipego's father milks Pendo twice a day. She produces about 24 litres of milk a day, so about 12 litres for each milking.Sometimes Chipego helps with the milking but it is not as easy as it looks. "One day," he thinks to himself, "I will have my own cows and I will have to do all the milking myself."
His father pours the milk from the big bucket into smaller two litre cans or one litre bottles. He then sells the milk for K8.00 a litre.Once a week Chipego's father donates 25 litres of milk to Bulela School feeding scheme. Each child gets a quarter litre of this milk. That means that 100 children get milk on this day.
For each litre of milk sold, his father gives Chipego 50 ngwee. That doesn't sound like a lot, but if his father sells 24 litres a day, it adds up to quite a bit. Can you tell how much?Chipego saves his money until Saturday when he makes a trip to the book shop. Each book costs less than k10.00, so in a good week, he can buy quite a few.
Chipego also loves to drink Pendo's milk. His father says that milk helps to build strong bones and teeth and makes a person fit and healthy.So by drinking milk and eating lots of vegetables from his father's garden, Chipego is strong and healthy. He seldom gets sick and never goes hungry. His mother loves making mabisi using Pendo's milk too. His young sister enjoys adding the milk to her chibwantu! Hmmm! Yummy!
Chipego never forgets to thank Pendo at the end of each day. He rewards her with extra carrots or spinach leaves that he finds lying around the garden."Thank you Pendo, you are my best friend! It is thanks to you that I am strong, healthy and clever. If not for you I would never be able to buy all the books that help me be top of my class." One day I will be a veterinary  doctor because of you!Pendo is very lucky because Mutinta, Chipego's mother and Father also rewards her! What an amazing cow!
This is Jaaka the fisherman from Naminya.
He fishes on the river Nile.
He has a boat,  fishing net and a hook.
He always wakes up very early in the morning to catch the Nile perch.
At around 10am,  he's selling his catch in Jinja central market.
Jaaka what happened? Was it a loss? He's so sad.
"Today the situation is bad. The Nile breeze did not permit me to fish. And one perch swam away with my hook."
"But I have hope that tomorrow will be good,  because I've bought a new hook."
Long ago,  there was no night in Opio's village. People slept when they were tired and worked when they were awake.
One day Opio went out hunting with his dogs. After a short time,  his dogs started to chase an antelope. Opio followed them. He ran for many hours. Every time he became tired,  he rested. Then he would run again. But he could not find his dogs.
After many days,  he came to a village. He went to one of the houses and said to the owner,  "I have chased an antelope for a long time and I am very tired. I want to rest." The man said,  "Sit down and rest. Would you like some beer?" Opio was very thirsty so he drank some. Then he went to sleep.
When he woke up,  he couldn't see. He opened and closed his eyes many times. "You have given me something very bad to drink," he said to the man. "I can't see properly anymore!" "There is nothing wrong with you," the man replied. "It's night now. Haven't you ever seen night? When the day leaves,  the night comes."
Opio asked many questions about the night. He began to like it very much. He and his new friend talked until morning. He stayed for another day so that he could see the night come again.
The next morning he asked his friend,  "How can I take the night to my own village? I want my people to see the night." The man explained,  "When it starts to get dark this evening,  walk to your village. If you look straight in front,  the night will follow you. If you look back,  the night will go away."
Opio did as he was told. That evening,  he began to walk towards his village. He felt the dark night behind him as he walked. He was tempted to look back,  but he did not.
When he came to his village,  the villagers were afraid. They asked Opio,  "What disease have you brought to us? What is this dark thing following you?" Opio said,  "My friends,  this dark thing is called night. You are afraid and I was afraid,  too."
Opio continued to explain,  "You will learn to like the night. When the light comes we can work and when night comes,  we can rest."
And that is how night came to Opio's village.
Once upon a time, there was a female giant. One day, she was walking near the lake.She met three little girls and asked them, "Who among you is loved by both parents?"
One of the girls said, "My mother loves me most." Another said, "My father loves me most." But the third one said, "I am loved by both parents."
The giant asked the girl loved by both parents to help her carry firewood. So the girl followed the giant.
They walked for some distance. The girl asked the giant, "Where is your firewood?" The giant replied, "It is near those trees over there!"
When they reached the trees, the girl asked again, "Where is your firewood?" The giant answered, "Not far now!"
They met a man along the way. He asked the giant, "What is the name of your child?" The giant replied, "She is called the talking bag."
The girl burst out and sang: I am not called the talking bag. My name is Kaamungei! Oh! My mother, whom I love. Oh! My father, whom I love. Oh! My calabash, which I use to drink milk!
When the man heard what the girl sang, he rescued her and took her back to her parents.The story ends there!
It is dry.
The sun is hot.
It is windy.
It is cloudy.
It is cold.

Lynne, Oupa Karel and Anton were getting things ready for Lynne's birthday party.
Anton and Lynne are going to bake a cake. Oupa Karel reads the recipe.
"Let's mix these ingredients in the big bowl," said Lynne.
Anton stirred the ingredients and made a big mess.
"The cake feels heavy now," said Oupa Karel.
"Your friends have arrived," said Oupa Karel.
Anton thought the first present would be heavy because it was big.
It was a pillow and it weighed very little.
Anton thought the next present would be light because it was small.
It was a painted rock and it weighed a lot.
The children said that 1 kilogram of rocks weighs the same as 1 kilogram of feathers.
Lynne's cake was burnt.
Lynne was very sad.
Auntie Mavis asked Anton to guess how much her present weighed.
"It weighs the same as the cake that burned," said Anton.
Everyone said, "happy birthday, Lynne."
Nestled in the Kingdom of the Zulu is a magnificent place called the Valley.
A little girl called Jabulile lives here. Jabulile was always a happy child. She was also curious, and full of questions about life.Everything fascinated her.
Jabulile’s father was a mielie farmer.Her mother was a teacher. They taught her to dream big dreams. Jabulile’s biggest dream was to help people.
One awful day, the clouds began to gather over the Valley. Everything grew dark and grey. An ugly storm swept over the land.
Great gusts of wind blew the roofs off the huts. All the animals lost their homes. It was a very sad day.
The village folk cried, “What shall we do now?”“All the crops are ruined!” cried the farmers. “Our homes are gone!” said the elders. All hope seemed lost. But Jabulile remembered something her wise father once told her.
Jabulile started speaking to the villagers.“The storm only hurts us,” she said, “because of the way we choose to see it. If you look up, the sun is shining again. It is a new day.“After every storm, there must be a rainbow!” she shouted excitedly.
The villagers saw the rainbow and they began to smile. It stood as a promise that the storm was over.
The villagers rebuilt their homes. Farmers planted new crops. The grass grew greener than ever before.
Once again there was hope and happiness in the Valley.
I'm Venus, I live with my mum, dad and older sister. It's our lunch time, there's oats, (yummy!)
There is a big boy who takes care of us with many other dogs, his name is Robin. He takes us for walk, to the vet and more. I am a bloodhound, so whenever he loses things in the fields, I help him!
Many times people come and buy the dogs from Robin and give him a card or some paper, (they call it cash.) He gives them the chosen dog after they pay.
Today a boy and a girl came with their parents to pick a dog. They finally picked me! I was Robin's favourite dog, they couldn't take me! But Robin had to give me, he told them "He's a special dog, take good care of him."
I am now with them for the past few months, they are a great family. I run with them, they feed me and I find their lost things. I still miss Robin, I want to see him. I will hopefully see him again.
My village has goats. It is far from big cities.
Mother said, "Zainab, we have a present for your sixth birthday."
Mother, aunt and I waited for the bus.
I sat on mother’s lap. I slept the whole way.
We reached the market. I saw a beautiful blue helicopter.
One stall had fruits. I asked mother, “Which ones are these?”
Mother said, “These are apples.” I begged, “Please, buy me one.”
I forgot my mother’s hand. I thought only of my apple.
When I finished eating, I was alone. I started to cry.
A woman took me where there were other children.
I thought children were sold at the market. I cried more.
A man asked, "Where is Zainab?"I hid away from him.
My mother's familiar voice called, "Zainab!" I was very happy.
My aunt pulled out a beautiful helicopter. "It's yours!" she said.
One day a very clever baby was born in Gungululu in the Eastern Cape. Her name was Sindiwe Magona. She was the oldest of eight children.
At night, her grandmother told magical stories about ogres and giants, animals of the forests, great beasts, and little creatures of the veld. It was Sindiwe’s favourite time.
Sindiwe loved school and she dreamed about being a teacher.
When Sindiwe became a teenager, her family organised a feast to celebrate. She was given special things to wear and a wise old man sang a praise song to her. (Blessings, long life! May your ancestors guard you!)
Sindiwe trained to be a teacher. She was very excited to teach at her first school. But there weren’t enough schools for black children and they had no desks or books to write in. This made Sindiwe feel scared. How could she be a good teacher when the children had nowhere to sit?
She left the school to work as a cleaner.She worked in four different houses. Sometimes the people there treated her badly and Sindiwe became very unhappy.
All this time Sindiwe studied. Her hard work paid off! She won a scholarship to study at a university in New York. She and her three small children packed their bags and flew across the sea to the United States of America.
In New York, Sindiwe studied to become a social worker. She wanted to help families make their lives better.
When she finished studying, the United Nations gave Sindiwe a job. Most of the countries in the world meet at the United Nations to talk about their problems.
Sindiwe told the world about South Africa, and how hard it was for black people living there. The people at the United Nations loved to listen to Sindiwe’s stories. They wanted to learn more and more about South Africans. Perhaps, together, they could help to change things in South Africa.
She worked at the United Nations for twenty years while her children grew into adults. But Sindiwe missed the country where she was born. She wanted to tell her stories to the people at home.So she packed her luggage, got on a plane and flew back over the sea to Cape Town.
Sindiwe’s love for books and stories have helped her write piles and piles of books. And children and grown-ups love to read her stories. Many people call her Nomabali because she’s always writing, telling and reading stories.

Every day when eight-year-old Sisanda gets home from school,  she changes out of her uniform,  eats her lunch and plays a game of umlabalaba with her grandfather. They have so much fun flying their "cows" around the board that she doesn't want to stop. But then he reminds her that she wants to become a bank manager one day when she grows up.
For her last birthday,  Sisanda had a special treat – her parents got permission for her to have a party at the game reserve. The giraffes at the reserve were curious about this group of people. They stretched out their long necks for the best view of the party and they even seemed to want some of the birthday cake! Sisanda loved the giraffes. All animals were special to her,  but it was the quiet and gentle giraffes that stole her heart. She could spend all day watching them.
"Oh no!" said Sisanda starting to cry. "I wish there was something I could do. The baby giraffe must be crying just like me." Sisanda cried and cried. Her mother tried to comfort her. She even read Sisanda an extra story at bedtime to help her forget how sorry she felt for that baby giraffe. Eventually,  Sisanda drifted off to sleep to the sound of her mama's voice.
They found the baby giraffe standing alone. His willowy neck drooped and his big brown eyes looked dull. Sisanda stood as close to him as she could. She opened her small bag and took out a book. Then,  to her parents' surprise,  she began to read to the baby giraffe. He turned his head towards her voice and listened as if he could understand every word. At first,  Sisanda's parents thought reading to a giraffe was a strange thing to do,  but they changed their minds when they saw how peaceful he looked − his gentle eyes looking at Sisanda.
On the day of the outing,  forty Grade 3 children waited eagerly for the reserve gates to open. Then Sisanda proudly led everyone to Thokozani. Some of the children looked at the tall giraffe in amazement. Others giggled nervously. Their teacher,  Miss Khanyile,  just smiled.

Early one morning Vusi's granny called him, "Vusi,  please take this egg to your parents. They want to make a large cake for your sister's wedding."
On his way to his parents, Vusi met two boys picking fruit. One boy grabbed the egg from Vusi and shot it at a tree. The egg broke.
"What have you done?" cried Vusi. "That egg was for a cake. The cake was for my sister's wedding. What will my sister say if there is no wedding cake?"
The boys were sorry for teasing Vusi. "We can't help with the cake, but here is a walking stick for your sister," said one. Vusi continued on his journey.
Along the way he met two men building a house. "Can we use that strong stick?" asked one. But the stick was not strong enough for building, and it broke.
"What have you done?" cried Vusi. "That stick was a gift for my sister. The fruit pickers gave me the stick because they broke the egg for the cake. The cake was for my sister's wedding. Now there is no egg, no cake, and no gift. What will my sister say?"
The builders were sorry for breaking the stick. "We can't help with the cake, but here is some thatch for your sister," said one. And so Vusi continued on his journey.
Along the way, Vusi met a farmer and a cow. "What delicious thatch, can I have a nibble?" asked the cow. But the thatch was so tasty that the cow ate it all!
"What have you done?" cried Vusi. "That thatch was a gift for my sister. The builders gave me the thatch because they broke the stick from the fruit pickers. The fruit pickers gave me the stick because they broke the egg for my sister's cake. The cake was for my sister's wedding. Now there is no egg, no cake, and no gift. What will my sister say?"
The cow was sorry she was greedy. The farmer agreed that the cow could go with Vusi as a gift for his sister. And so Vusi carried on.
But the cow ran back to the farmer at supper time.  Vusi got lost on his journey. He arrived very late for his sister's wedding. The guests were already eating.
"What shall I do?" cried Vusi. "The cow that ran away was a gift, in return for the thatch the builders gave me. The builders gave me the thatch because they broke the stick from the fruit pickers. The fruit pickers gave me the stick because they broke the egg for the cake. The cake was for the wedding. Now there is no egg, no cake, and no gift."
Vusi's sister thought for a while, then she said, "Vusi my brother, I don't really care about gifts. I don't even care about the cake! We are all here together, I am happy. Now put on your smart clothes and let's celebrate this day!" And so, that's what Vusi did.
Long ago, there was a man who had a very serious wound on his leg. He could not stand or walk. This man lived in a village with his wife and their children.
The couple had three sons and one daughter. The daughter's name was Nangila. Her duty was to take care of her father. The sons worked on the land and grazed animals.
Nangila was a beautiful girl. All the villagers liked and respected her. Her parents wanted a good husband for Nangila. They set a difficult task in order to find the right man.
Anyone who wanted to marry Nangila would have to get a herb from a lake near the village. This herb would heal her father's wound. But the lake was filled with dangerous spirits.
Some men tried to get the herb but returned without it. Some men did not return from the lake at all.
Nangila felt worried. Not even her brothers would go to the lake. One day, she decided to fetch the herb herself. Her mother said, "My daughter, if strong men have failed, how will you succeed?" But Nangila had made up her mind.
On the way to the lake, Nangila met an old woman carrying wood. She helped the woman to carry her firewood. The old woman was grateful. She said to Nangila, "I will tell you how to reach the spirit lake and what to do when you get there."
When she reached the shore of the lake, Nangila saw the spirit family drinking and dancing. She waited and watched. One by one, the spirits fell asleep.
Once the spirits were all sleeping, Nangila dived into the lake. She found the herb and put it in her bag. As she swam back to land, the waves were rising.
When Nangila reached the shore the spirits were awake. She was afraid, but she sang the song the old woman taught her: I, daughter of Wekesa, am from the lake. I came because men are too scared to come. My father needs this herb to heal his wound. That is why I am here, in the land where many are scared to reach, for you are the rulers.
Nangila's voice was so sweet that the spirits asked her to sing for them again and again. Her singing sent the spirits back to sleep. Then Nangila ran very fast until she got to her village.
Everyone was waiting for Nangila to return. After treating his wound with the herb her father was able to stand again. The entire village danced and praised Nangila.
It happened one year that the rain didn't fall. The trees dried up and died. The rivers disappeared and the water evaporated. People and animals were dying from hunger and thirst.
The chief animals met to talk about the situation. Lion said, "Let's call everyone together and discuss the idea of digging a well. We can drink from its waters."Elephant agreed and went off to spread the news to the other animals.
All the animals gathered to discuss the situation. Lion began, saying, "My brothers and sisters, this year the rain has not fallen. Everyone is dying from hunger and thirst. Let us dig a well so that we can all drink from it."
The animals all agreed and immediately grabbed hoes, shovels and picks. They started digging a well.
Hare had not come, but the other animals continued without him. They dug. And they dug. And they dug some more. And finally they hit water. When they struck water, Lion said, "Why did Hare not come to help? He will not drink from this water!"
Later Hare came and saw the well. He said, "Hello?" But he heard nothing. So he went in and splashed around in the water for a while.
The next day, when the animals came, they saw that their well was a big mess. The water was nothing but mud. They asked, "Who would do such a thing?" Someone said, "I bet it was Hare, because when we were digging the well he was nowhere to be found."
The animals decided to leave a guard at the well. They chose Baboon to keep an eye on things. Hare came to the well that night, and said, "Hello?" And Baboon replied, "Hello!" So Hare came over to Baboon, saying "Try this!" Hare gave Baboon some honey. And Baboon let him take some water. Just then, Hyena arrived and saw Hare drinking.
The next day, Hyena went and told all the animals that Hare had taken water from the well. They chose Turtle to guard the well. Turtle was on the job when Hare arrived at night, saying, "Hello?" He didn't hear a sound.He started talking to himself, "Lucky me! I've come to have a little drink."
When Turtle had arrived at the well, she had hidden herself among the rocks. She looked just like another rock. As soon as Hare started to go into the water, Turtle grabbed Hare by the leg. Hare said, "Oops, you didn't grab me. You've grabbed a stick!" But Turtle didn't say a word. She stayed there holding onto Hare until the sunrise.
When Lion arrived, he saw that Turtle had captured Hare. He called the rest of the animals to decide what to do with Hare. When all the animals were assembled, Lion asked them, "What shall we do with Hare?"Turtle said, "I want Elephant to grab him with her trunk and beat him on rocks." All the other animals agreed.
Hare quickly said, "O Great Lion, you know that hares don't die if you hit them on rocks. A hare will only die if he is thrown into ashes."So, Lion told Elephant to grab Hare. Elephant picked him up and started hitting him in a pile of ash from a fire.
After Hare was completely covered in ashes, Elephant threw him. As Hare landed he made a big cloud of dust! When the animals saw the dust they really laughed.
When the dust settled, the animals looked around and Hare was gone! And then they knew that Hare had tricked them again.
An apple fell from a tree under which Rabbit was sleeping.
Rabbit heard a voice say, “Run Rabbit run!”
Rabbit told Chicken, “Something fell and I heard, ‘Run Rabbit run!'”
Chicken started running when she heard what Rabbit said.
They told Dog, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Dog started running with Rabbit and Chicken.
Dog told Horse, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Horse started to run with the others.
Donkey asked, “Why are you running?” Horse replied, “I don’t know.”
Donkey started running with them.
Donkey told Cow, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Cow was worried and started to run as well.
Cow told Cat, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Cat started running with the other animals.
They met a boy. “Don’t you know what happened?” he asked.
“It was me who said, ‘Run Rabbit run!’” laughed the boy.
There was once a girl called Chikondi who lived with her parents near the village of Chionda. One day Chikondi's mother sent her to fetch water at the well.
On the way,  she met her friends. They were going to the forest to get firewood. Chikondi wanted to go with them. "Please wait for me under this  masuku tree!" she said,  "I have to fetch water for my mother." But her friends didn't want to wait.
"All right,  I'll catch up with you in the forest!" said Chikondi She ran off to fetch water and take it to her mother. Then she went to the forest to look for her friends.
She followed a path that led to a stream. On the other side of the stream were many tiny paths each one,  leading in a different direction. "Which path had her friends taken?" she wondered.
She chose the biggest path,  and walked and walked,  but she could not find her friends. She was so tired that when she sat under a tree to rest,  she fell fast asleep.
When Chikondi woke up,  it was dark. In the darkness,  yellow eyes were gleaming. She was surrounded by hyenas! She was too terrified even to cry out. She tried running,  but the hyenas circled her hungrily.
"Don't move," said the gruff voice of the biggest hyena. "If you run,  we'll eat you!" "Please let me go home!" Chikonde pleaded.
But instead the hyenas took Chikondi to their house in the forest. It was a dirty hut full of bones and buzzing flies. She lay down and pretended to go to sleep.
In the darkness,  she heard the hyenas talking to each other. "How is the fire doing?" one hyena asked. "Is the water boiling?" "Everything is ready," was the reply. "Should I bring her?" "Yes,  yes!" growled the other hyenas. "We're hungry!" They were ready to drag Chikondi out of the hut.
But the big hyena spoke,  "Hyenas,  wait. Remember the rule of the village. No hyena may eat alone. We have to invite the whole family to share a meal." "I'll go and call the in-laws," said his wife. "I'll go and fetch my cousins," said the small hyena. "I'll fetch our brothers and sisters," said another. "And I will remain here with our food," said the big hyena.
The big hyena sat in the doorway of the hut and the others went off in different directions. They took a long time,  and the big hyena began to doze in front of the warm fire. Soon he was snoring. This was Chikondi's chance! But how was she going to get past the hyena? He was so big he filled the whole doorway.
There was only one way. She took a flying leap right over the hyena's back,  and ran as fast as her legs could carry her.
Just then the other hyenas returned,  and saw what had happened. They ran after her,  howling with anger and disappointment. But it was too late.
As she came to her village,  one of the villagers recognised her and shouted,  "Chikondi,  "Chikondi is coming,  "Chikondi is coming." Her father and mother ran out to meet her. They hugged her,  while thanking God for saving their child,  ""Chikondi,  "Chikondi  we thought you had died!"
From that day,  "Chikondi and the other children never again went back to the forest alone.
In a country called Gabon,  a little village stood at the very edge of a forest. In the heart of this forest,  in the highest branches of an enormous tree,  lived a very special bird − the bird that made rain.
For as far back as the villagers could remember,  they had taken the time to keep this bird happy. They saved scraps of bread,  pieces of fruit and fresh coconut milk,  and every week or two a group of villagers took these delicacies into the forest. When they had laid them at the base of the tree,  one of them played a simple tune on the thumb piano.
After a while,  the bird flew down to the ground to eat and drink. When she had finished,  she began to sing the most beautiful song.   At the same time,  she raised her dark,  shiny blue wings,  and within minutes,  the rain began to fall.
This went on for many years. Because the rain fell regularly,  the crops grew abundantly and there was plenty of food in the village.   But gradually things began to change. Somehow,  the villagers were always busy and they began to neglect the rain bird. "It will rain anyway," they said. "It's time to stop spoiling that silly old bird!"
But the people were wrong. When they stopped looking after the bird,  the rain stopped falling. The crops began to dry up and die,  and the animals grew thin and weak. Still,  nobody in the village went into the forest to feed the bird that brought the rain. Now they were all too busy trying to find money to buy food in the neighbouring town.
One scorching day,  a young girl called Ketti decided to go into the forest after school. "At least it will be cool in there," she thought. She walked and walked,  and after some time,  she came to the tall tree in which the rain bird lived. Ketti stared up at the tree. Suddenly,  she remembered how her granny had taken her into the forest to feed the bird when she was still a tiny child. Ketti opened her school bag and pulled out a piece of bread left over from her lunch. Carefully she laid the bread at the base of the tree. Then because she had no thumb piano, she sang an old song that she had known all her life.
With a loud whooshing sound,  a beautiful blue bird swooped out of the branches above Ketti's head and began to eat the bread. When the bird had finished,  she opened her mouth and sang a few pure,  high notes. Then she raised her shiny wings and all of a sudden Ketti heard the rumble of thunder. By the time she reached her home,  giant rain drops were pelting down,  cooling the baking red earth.
Ketti was very happy,  until she told her parents what had happened. "Don't be silly!" scolded her mother. "Nobody believes that bird has anything to do with the rain anymore!" "Your mother is right," said Ketti's father. "The drought has been broken now and we will be fine. Don't go wasting good bread feeding that greedy old bird again!"   Though Ketti didn't argue with her parents,  she felt sure they were wrong. "If only Granny were still alive," she said to herself,  "she would have believed me!" But Ketti's granny had died a few years earlier. The only thing Ketti had left,  was her granny's old thumb piano.
Two weeks passed and there was no more rain. The crops began to shrivel up again and the hungry animals' ribs began to stick out even more. The sun beat down mercilessly from a glaring blue sky.   "I don't care what they say!" thought Ketti. "We need rain. I'm going to feed the bird again tomorrow!"
So,  early the next morning,  after taking a slice of bread and a handful of red berries from the kitchen,  Ketti slipped out of the house. She began to make her way to the centre of the forest.   What she didn't realise,  was that her father was also awake. When he saw what his daughter was doing,  he realised that she was going to feed the rain bird again.
"I'll teach that  child a lesson!" he said to himself angrily. He snatched his bow and arrows and silently followed Ketti into the forest. Just as the bird flew down to eat the food that Ketti had set out for it,  her father raised his bow and released his deadly arrow. The arrow flew straight into the bird's heart. The bird let out a piercing shriek. Terrified,  Ketti spun around − just in time to see her father fall down,  stone dead. Ketti screamed and turned around − just in time to see the arrow fall harmlessly from the bird's glossy body. Then the bird,  unharmed, swooped up into the highest branch of the tree.
Ketti raced out of the forest to a scene of utter devastation. Every animal and every person she saw lay dead on the ground. With a pounding heart,  she ran all the way back to her home.  She quickly found her granny's old thumb piano. "This is my only hope!" she thought. "The rain bird is angry. I have to make her happy again! I HAVE to!"
Half an hour later,  Ketti was back at the base of the big tree. Her body was drenched with sweat and she was gasping for breath. A few paces away from her lay the lifeless body of her father. Ketti looked away quickly,  and with trembling hands,  began to play the thumb piano. She played and played,  until her fingers hurt.
Finally,  what she wanted most in the world happened. Down swooped the bird as if nothing had happened. The bird ate some of the berries still lying on the ground and sang a few notes. Then,  as Ketti played on,  the bird raised her wings. Ketti heard a rustle behind her.
It was her father who had woken up! "I'm sorry!" he said again and again to the big, blue bird. Then he held out his hand to his daughter and they walked slowly back to the village. In the village all the people and animals were alive again.
That night the villagers held a meeting.They all agreed that they had learned a valuable lesson. And from that day onwards,  not one week passed without a special trip to the forest to feed the bird that brought the rain.

Long ago, there was a man who had a very serious wound on his leg. He could not stand or walk. This man lived in a village with his wife and their children.
The couple had three sons and one daughter. The daughter's name was Nangila. Her duty was to take care of her father. The sons worked on the land and grazed animals.
Nangila was a beautiful girl. All the villagers liked and respected her. Her parents wanted a good husband for Nangila. They set a difficult task in order to find theright man.
Anyone who wanted to marry Nangila would have to get a herb from a lake near the village. This herb would healher father's wound. Butthe lake was filled with dangerous spirits.
Some men tried to get the herb but returned without it. Some men did not return from the lake at all.
Nangila felt worried. Not even her brothers would go to the lake. One day, she decided to fetch the herb herself. Her mother said, "My daughter, if strong men have failed, how will you succeed?" But Nangila had made up her mind.
On the way to the lake, Nangila met an old woman carrying wood. She helped the woman to carry her firewood. The old woman was grateful. She said to Nangila, "I will tell you how to reach the spirit lake and what to do when you get there."
When she reached the shore of the lake, Nangila saw the spirit family drinking and dancing. She waited and watched. One by one, the spirits fell asleep.
Once the spirits were all sleeping, Nangila dived intothe lake. She found the herb and put it in her bag. As she swam back to land, the waves were rising.
When Nangila reached the shore the spirits were awake. She was afraid, but she sang the song the old woman taught her, "I, daughter of Wekesa, am from the lake. I came because men are too scared to come. My father needs this herb to heal his wound. That is why I am here, in the land where many are scared to reach, for you are the rulers."
Nangila's voice was so sweet that the spirits asked her to sing for them again and again. Her singing sent the spirits back to sleep. Then Nangila ran very fast until she got to her village.
Everyone was waiting for Nangila to return. After treating his wound with the herb her father was able to stand again. The entire village danced and praised Nangila.

Goat was king of animals and birds. He called a meeting.
Goat told them that he had a dream. They all listened.
The dream was about hunger. "What shall we do?" asked Cat.
Hen and Duck said, "Let's keep food in the king's store."
King Goat said, "Tie up anyone who does not obey."
The time came to choose a new king. They chose Cat.
Goat did not want Cat as king. "I am the king," Goat said angrily.
Goat did not take food. Cow asked, "What shall we do?"
The animals and birds talked together. They were angry with Goat.
Dog said, "I was always with him when he was king."
Sheep said, "I gave his children my beautiful wool when he was king."
Pig cried, "When he was king, I looked after his garden."
"Did Goat think he will be king forever?" Sheep  asked.
The animals agreed that Goat must take food to king Cat.
The animals found Goat relaxing. Goat said, "I will always be king."
"We will tie you and take you to the new king."
Cow pulled Goat to the king's court. Others cheered.
That's why goats refuse to move when they are pulled.
Long, long ago there were seven suns in the sky. Their rays made the earth so hot that human beings could not bear it.
So, the seven brothers belonging to a tribe called the Munda decided to kill the suns. They shot arrows at them and were able to kill six of the suns.
The seventh sun hid behind a hill.
Now, with the suns gone, there was darkness everywhere. The deer could not see the tigers. The elephants bumped into trees. The rabbits walked over the lions and there was confusion all around.
To find a solution, the animals decided to have a meeting. A rabbit told them about one of the seven suns who was still alive and hiding behind a hill. But who would be the best one to call back the sun?
"I will call out to the sun," said the lion, for he was the king of the forest. "Sun, sun, please do not run away. Come back and shine on us," roared the lion. But the sun did not listen to him.
The elephant called out next. He raised his trunk and trumpeted, "Sun, sun, please come back." But the sun did not listen to him.
The peacock danced and pleaded, "Sun, sun, please come back." But the sun refused to come out. One after the other, all the animals called out to the sun. But he did not listen to any of them. Finally, a rooster offered to call the sun. Everybody laughed.
The lion said, "The rooster should be allowed to try." Rooster stepped forward and gently crowed,  "Kookoodokoo, koo." To everyone's surprise, the sun peeped out a little from behind the hill.
The rooster crowed again, this time more boldly, "KookoodoKOO-KOO." The sun came up a little higher. The rooster crowed a third time, even louder and bolder, "KOOKOODOKOO-KOO." The sun rose high and bright. There was light everywhere. The animals were delighted and the humans felt relieved.
Ever since that day, when the rooster crows in the morning, the sun rises and shines in the sky.
I have a friend. She lives in my house.
When I am happy, so is she.
When I cry, she cries too.
But I cannot hear her voice. My friend lives inside the mirror.
“Come out,” I tell her, “we will play.” She does not come out.
I am not happy. I go to sleep.
She comes out of the mirror in my sleep! And we have fun.
We play, we run, we shout and scream together.

Tamara was a five-year-old girl who lived with her family. Their village was near a forest that had wild animals.
Tamara was obedient to her parents. She looked after sheep and goats.
Tamara loved listening to birds singing as she took care of the animals. As the birds sang, she put her own words to the tune.
Tamara was too young for school. Her parents only allowed their older children, Nashipae and Tasieku, to go to school. It was 10 kilometres away.
Nashipae and Tasieku went with other children from the village in the morning and returned in the evening. They carried food in small containers.
Tamara asked her mother, "When will I go to school?" Her mother answered, "You will go soon, my dear child."
One day, a car arrived with the chief and two ladies. The chief made sure that children went to school at the right age.
People believed that if a child was able to stretch her hand over her head and touch the ear, she was ready to start school.
The chief asked, "How old are you?" Tamara replied, "I am five years old." "Let's see if you can go to school," the chief said.
One of the ladies took Tamara's right arm and gently placed it over her head. Tamara touched her left ear.
Tamara would go to a different school than Nashipae and Tasieku. It was new and closer to home.
Tamara was very happy. She thought, "I will read and write like Nashipae and Tasieku."
Once upon a time Eagle and Hen were best friends. The two of them were together and chatted from morning till dusk. Eagle's chickens couldn't wait to visit Hen's chickens and play with them.
One day Hen approached Eagle. “My friend,” she said. “I have to ask you a big favour. Rooster's pyjama pants are torn. He is really grumpy about it. They are his favourite pants. I want to mend the pants, but I don't have a needle. May I borrow your needle?” Eagle nodded. “Of course, dear friend,” she said. “But please take good care of it. It is an heirloom needle. My grandmother gave it to me.” “Of course, my friend,” Hen said. She took the shining needle. “I'll return it tomorrow.”
Hen went away to mend her husband's pants. The next morning, as usual, Hen was on her way to Eagle. But oh, goodness – the needle was gone! Hen anxiously called her little chicks together. “Has anyone seen Eagle's needle?” she asked. “No, Mommy,” the chickens cheeped. “Help me look for it,” Hen said.
Hen and her chickens looked everywhere. In every bush. Behind every lump of grass. Inside all their nests. But Eagle's needle was gone.
Eagle waited the whole day for Hen to come and visit. By dusk she was getting annoyed. She flew to the farm yard. “Good evening, friend,” she greeted Hen. “Why didn't you visit me today?” “I I was very busy,” Hen said.
“And where is the needle you borrowed from me?” Eagle asked.” “Hen swallowed.” “Oh, Eagle I am so sorry. I lost your needle.” “Lost it?" Eagle was angry. “Don't worry,” Hen said quickly. “My chickens and I will find it.” It must be here somewhere.
Eagle was very angry. “I can't believe you lost my needle,” she said. “The needle I got from my grandma. You'd better look for it. If you haven't found it by tomorrow, I will come and grab one of your chickens.” The following morning Rooster had barely started crowing when Hen called on her chicks. “Kids, you must help me look for it,” she said. “We'll scratch around this whole farm yard. Eagle's needle must be here.”
Look carefully when you see Hen and her chickens again. Up until this day they are still scratching around in the dust, looking for Eagle's needle. And when Hen notices an eagle flying in the air, she anxiously clucks: “Quick, little chicks. Hide beneath my wings. If Eagle sees you, she will catch you. She is still annoyed about her grandmother's needle.”
A long time ago,  in the vast city of Johannesburg,  a baby girl was born. That baby was me. My mom called me Miriam. Miriam Makeba.
Mom was a sangoma,  but she also worked to make other people's homes neat and clean. It was hard for my mom to earn enough for both of us. She started selling homemade beer to bring in more money.
The laws of the land said that selling homemade beer was wrong. The police sent my mom to jail for six long months. I was only 18 days old,  and needed my mom. So even though I was just a baby,  I went to jail too.
As a little girl I loved to sing. When I was older,  I helped my mom clean houses. Singing songs as I worked made the chores go faster and the days seem brighter. Singing made me happier than I can explain.
I sang in my church,  and this made others happy too. Music has the power to bring people together. When we were singing we felt brave and strong.
People said my voice was a gift and my songs were special. I sang with other musicians and our music was heard all over the world.
My home was Sophiatown,  a place of culture and music. Sophiatown,  a place where South Africans could make music in harmony and dance together. But the people who ruled the land at the time did not like this togetherness. Those rulers didn't want black and white people to be friends.
I knew it was wrong to treat people differently because of their skin colour. I did not hide my beliefs,  and so those people in charge wanted me out of the country. When I was singing in America,  I was told I could never return home.
People all over the world heard my story. My songs and my story helped many to see how there was no fairness in South Africa for those with black skin. I decided to go on singing and telling the truth about my country,  no matter what.
The world loved my music and I was welcomed in many countries. I won awards and sang for important people all over the globe. My life was good,  but something was missing. I could not sing in my home country,  and people there were not free.
Then a wonderful day dawned when Nelson Mandela became president of South Africa. New people were in charge and the unfair laws belonged to the past. I finally went home with new hope in my heart.
After that I could sing in a free,  fair country. People of different skin colours could enjoy music together. I helped make this happen because I was brave and strong. I sang the truth in all of my songs.
I can run with it.
I can jump with it.
I can dance with it.
I can swim with it.
I can skip with it.
I can kick with it.
I can escape with it.
But I can never fly with it.
A long time ago,  three girls went out to collect wood.
It was a hot day so they went down to the river to swim. They played and splashed and swam in the water.
Suddenly,  they realised that it was late. They hurried back to the village.
When they were nearly home,  Nozibele put her hand to her neck. She had forgotten her necklace! "Please come back with me!" she begged her friends. But her friends said it was too late.
Nozibele went back to the river alone. She found her necklace and began hurrying home. But,  she got lost in the dark.
In the distance she saw light coming from a hut. She walked quickly towards it and knocked at the door.
To her surprise,  a dog opened the door and said,  "What do you want?" "I'm lost and I need a place to sleep," said Nozibele. "Come in,  or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele went in.
The dog said,  "Cook for me!" "But I've never cooked for a dog before," Nozibele answered. "Cook,  or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele cooked some food for the dog.
Then the dog said,  "Make the bed for me!" Nozibele answered,  "I've never made a bed for a dog." "Make the bed,  or I'll bite you!" the dog said. Nozibele made the bed.
Every day she had to cook and sweep and wash for the dog. Then one day the dog said,  "Nozibele,  today I have to visit some friends. Sweep the house,  cook the food and wash my things before I come back."
As soon as the dog had gone,  Nozibele took three hairs from her head. She put one hair under the bed,  one behind the door,  and one in the kraal. Then she ran home as fast as she could.
When the dog came back,  he looked for Nozibele. "Nozibele,  where are you?" he shouted. "I'm here,  under the bed," said the first hair. "I'm here,  behind the door," said the second hair. "I'm here,  in the kraal," said the third hair.
The dog knew that Nozibele had tricked him. He ran and ran all the way to the village. But Nozibele's brothers were waiting there with big sticks. The dog turned and ran away and has never been seen since.

"Yippee!" Zonke shouts when the school bell rings. At last he can go home. This afternoon he wants to play soccer with the other boys. "Hey! Look out," a voice suddenly rings out in front of him. He never noticed Bheka. Bheka growls at him.
"Sorry," Zonke quickly replies. He wants to walk around Bheka. But Bheka suddenly pushes him. Zonke stumbles. Bheka laughs. "Do you have big feet that you fall so easily?" he mocks. Annoyed Zonke straightens himself. A girl,  Thandi,  helps him."Thank you," Zonke says. "You're welcome," Thandi says. "I saw everything. Bheka really is a bully."
Zonke runs home. It's quite hot. Fortunately the house isn't far. Suddenly he notices something in the road. He stops. What is it? It is as big as the palm of his hand. It is brown. And it is made from leather.
It's a wallet! Zonke can't believe his luck. He quickly glances inside the wallet. Wow,  it contains money!
Zonke's heart beats faster. Then he puts the wallet in his pocket. He quickly glances around to see if someone noticed. Yes! Somebody is approaching. It's Bheka. He is only a few steps behind Zonke.
Zonke hurries on. He hopes Bheka hasn't seen him. He doesn't want to glance over his shoulder again. The wallet lies safely in his pocket. When he gets home he will take it out and see how much money it contains.
At home Zonke puts down his school case. Then he walks to the shady tree next to the house. Carefully he takes the wallet from his pocket. His heart beats faster. He counts the notes. Fifty one hundred a hundred and fifty two hundred Rand! He is mega rich. But then he hears a familiar voice. "What are you hiding?" It is Bheka!
Zonke hides the wallet behind his back. "Too late. I saw you picking something up," Bheka says. "That's why I came to check you out." Bheka pulls Zonke's arm. His eyes grow wide when he sees the wallet. He takes it. "Wow! This is nice. Are you going to keep it?" Bheka asks.
"I I don't know yet," Zonke stammers. Bheka also counts the money. "You know the saying: finders keepers." Bheka whistles. "You must surely keep it. If I picked it up,  I would keep it." "But somebody lost it," Zonke says. Bheka laughs. "So what? They were careless. That's why it's your money now."
"I will have to think about it," Zonke says. "You don't have to think about it," Bheka says. "I'll tell you what to do. KEEP THE MONEY. Buy yourself a new pair of shoes. Or a soccer ball." "No!" a girl's voice sounds. It is Thandi from school. "Zonke,  the money doesn't belong to you. You don't have the right to keep it."
"What do you know,  Thandi?" Bheka asks. He pulls a face. "You're just trying to be miss smarty pants. Zonke doesn't have to return the money." Zonke listens to the two of them. He doesn't know what to do. He would like to keep the money. But Thandi may be right. You can't take things that don't belong to you. Even if you pick them up. Bheka suddenly stands right in front of him. Bheka folds his arms. "So,  what are you going to do,  Zonke? Will you keep the money? Or will you try to find the owner?" Zonke thinks and thinks.
"I'm going to return it," Zonke suddenly says loudly. Thandi smiles. "That's the right thing to do. You'll see." Bheka shakes his head. He returns the wallet to Zonke. "You're a coward," he says and leaves. "You're not," Thandi tells Zonke softly. "If you keep the purse you will be as ugly as Bheka himself." Zonke smiles. He is glad she has helped him make the right decision. "How are we going to find out whose money it is?" he asks.
Thandi looks inside the wallet. She takes out a bank card. Gugu Dube is written on the card. The name sounds familiar to Zonke. Thandi removes something else from the wallet. It's a small picture of Gugu and her children. Now Zonke recognises her. "She lives nearby. Come along. We're going to return her wallet."
Together Zonke and Thandi run along the gravel road. Auntie Gugu's door is open. They knock. In a moment someone comes to the door. It's auntie Gugu. Shame,  she seems to be crying.
Zonke feels bad that auntie Gugu is crying. But then he takes the wallet from his pocket. Auntie Gugu's sad face immediately turns happy. She laughs. "My wallet!" she shouts. "I can't believe it." She checks the money in the wallet. "And all the money is here. I am so happy. I had to go and buy some food. But then I lost my wallet. I thought we would go hungry this week." She gives both Zonke and Thandi a kiss on the forehead. Then she danced around with joy.

Once upon a time, Sly Jackal woke up early in the morning. He was very hungry. His tummy gave a big growl. GRRrrrrr! He jumped up and went searching for food.
He wandered around the forest for hours without getting any food. The sun was very hot. Sly Jackal could barely see in front of him. All he could think of was his hunger pangs.
"Aaauuuu!" Sly Jackal let out a loud scream. He fell into a well right in front of him. He was so hungry that he did not spot it.
"Oh my hat!" he thought. "I have to get out of this well. I will die of hunger."
Sly Jackal screamed and shouted, "Help! Anyone help!" Donkey was grazing a few metres away from the well. Donkey heard Sly Jackal's desperate cry. He came rushing.
"What is the matter?" Donkey was very worried. "The water in this well is cool and sweet. I am bored swimming alone. I need someone to help me swim. Please will you join me?"
"The sun is very hot," said Donkey. "I can't swim very well though." "Jump in! I will help you come out of the well," promised the Sly Jackal.
Donkey jumped into the well. The water was so cool. He was free from the heat. Before he knew it, the jackal had jumped on his back and out of the well. Sly Jackal laughed and ran away. Donkey was trapped in the well. He started screaming and shouting, "Help! Anyone help!"
When Asiimwe was still young, her mother loved her very much. She used to make her sleep on a good mat.
This mat was special. It was made of palm leaves in different colours.
The land around Asiimwe's home was dry and hot.There were many snakes, spiders and scorpions, but they didn't harm her.
According to her mother, Asiimwe's mat protected her.
Asiimwe started going to the local well. She also knew her grandmother's home and loved visiting her.
By bad luck, one day Asiimwe got lost on her way to her grandmother's home.
She sat down under a musisa tree and waited for help. While waiting, she fell asleep.
She started dreaming of a woman who looked like her grandmother. She was very happy.
When she woke up, she saw a bird and heard it calling her, "Asiimwe, Asiimwe, wake up and go home."
The bird flew while dropping a piece of mat that looked like Asiimwe's mat. Asiimwe followed the bird.
The bird led Asiimwe safely back home. Her family celebrated her return.
One harsh winter, many people in the land were sick. Ma Monikazi’s cheeks burned. Sweat dripped from her body. She wanted to hold the icy grass to her face to cool down. Under her blanket she held her belly and sang to the baby inside her: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”Her stomach growled when the baby’s powerful kicks woke her at night. She ate the leftover meat in the cooking pot, hungry for life.
One bright night the moon was bigger, fatter and pinker than ever. Her breath came fast. The baby was ready. The aunties in the birthing room rubbed her back and warmed the water. When Monikazi held her beautiful daughter in her arms, she knew she was a special girl, a fighter.What a blessing! Her name is Nontsikelelo. She will be the mother of all blessings.
Nontsikelelo was beautiful and strong with crinkling black button eyes. She loved her older brother, Mcengi. He made her laugh and so the laughter spread. She loved to eat meat before she had teeth. Her favourite aunt always kept a little portion on the side of her plate for Ntsiki. Mcengi chased the chickens that scratched in the garden where Ma Monikazi grew spinach and squash to feed her family. Ntsiki ran after him as her legs grew strong.Ma Monikazi had another baby boy, Velaphi, and another, Qudalele. Finally another sister, Nomyaleko. Little Ntsiki folded napkins and washed the baby clothes. She swept the house and fed the fire. She picked up her baby brother when he cried and tickled him till he laughed.She taught them to sing: “Be strong, little one. Winter is gone. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”
Qingqiwe, her grandfather, raised horses. His favourite was Shishi, a glossy black mare. As soon as Ntsiki was old enough, he hoisted her on to the saddle in front of him. His strong arms reached around her. He laced the reins through her fingers.He taught her to talk softly to Shishi, to groom her with a hard bristled brush. When she stroked its glossy coat, Albertina whispered, “You are the most beautiful creature. Thank you for letting me ride on your back.”Her father, Bonilizwe, came home from the mines at Christmas. Ntsiki pulled herself up onto Shishi’s broad back. She rode out to meet him at the bus stop. Ntsiki sat tall and straight. Her knees held firm. She handled the reins with gentle fingers.How proud Bonilizwe was of his daughter. The biggest smile Ntsiki had ever seen covered her father’s face.
On her sixth birthday she went to school. “You must choose an English name,” said the Presbyterian teacher, but Ntsiki liked her own name. “Why do I need a new name?” she asked. The teacher scowled and read the names aloud: “Adah, Agnes, Albertina, Anna.” What did they mean? Ntsiki liked the long name best. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had rhythm. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had bounce. Albertina was a name you didn’t mess with.When her cousin married a handsome man from a nearby town, Albertina was chosen as an umkhapi. The maid of honour! Weeks before the wedding, she stitched her isikhakha, the short traditional skirt, and threaded bright beads onto her amatikiti. Her mother gave her the white flag and said, “You have a big job, my blessing.”At the bend in the road Albertina waved the flag, then turned Shishi back, leading everybody from miles around to the ceremony. People would gossip if she made a mistake, but the guests lined the road. They ululated and sang. They threw down flowers for the horse and the girl.
Her mother was often sick and needed Albertina to look after the home. In her last year of primary school, Albertina was the oldest pupil in the school. She was chosen to be the head girl and wore her badge with pride.Her best friend, Betty, told her about a competition, saying, “You must apply, my clever friend.” “What is the prize?” asked Albertina, growing curious.“A scholarship to high school!” said Betty. “You must apply. You’ll win it, for sure.”
Albertina studied until the candle burned down. She practised sums. She practised spelling. She sharpened her pencils and gave her shoes an extra shine. Next morning she passed Shishi in her paddock. The horse whinnied and stamped the ground.The test began. Albertina’s fingers shook. The sums were tricky. Her mouth went dry. Her hand cramped on her pencil but she continued. “Well done, Albertina!” said her teacher at the end. The important official arrived and called the top two students to the stage. “Well done to Albertina for full marks,” he said, “but you are too old. The scholarship goes to…”Albertina tried not to cry. “That’s unfair,” shouted Betty, hopping with fury. “That wasn’t in the rules!” How would Albertina go to high school now? She dragged her feet all the way home.The teacher wrote to the newspaper about the unfair decision. Brother Joe at the Catholic Mission station read the story over his breakfast. He cracked his boiled egg with an extra flourish. He pushed the newspaper across the table to Father Bernard. He didn’t like the story one bit either.
Soon enough there was a scholarship for Albertina. Mariazell near Matatiele was a long way from Xolobe, but the whole village erupted. Their home girl was off to high school. She would make them proud. They threw a party like no other. The women brewed the sorghum beer and lit the fires. They slaughtered chickens and stirred up pots of meat. Albertina smiled till her face ached.She packed her brown suitcase and polished her shoes again. Before setting off on the bus to Matatiele, she said goodbye to Shishi. Albertina brushed her coat and stroked her wiry mane. She whispered all her questions into the horse’s silky ear: What if I get lost? Will I make new friends? Will I still be clever so far from home? Shishi whinnied and stamped the ground.
School days started well before sunrise. The girls washed quickly in the cold water and swept the dormitories before Mass. The milky porridge was never quite enough; the stew not as tasty as Aunty’s back home. But Albertina studied hard. She played netball on sunny afternoons.In her school holidays Albertina worked at the mission station. She rubbed and scrubbed against the zinc washboard. She boiled sheets in copper tubs, then wound them through the wringer. She hoed and tilled the school garden but missed her family. Who was telling her brothers and sisters funny stories? Who wiped their eyes when they cried? Who tickled them until they laughed?Albertina loved the nuns who taught her. Could she become a holy sister? “But nuns earn no salary,” said Father Bernard. “Perhaps you should become a nurse? You’ll be paid while you study.”
Albertina took a train to Johannesburg. She bought a smart white uniform, new navy shoes and a shiny red fountain pen. Sick people came all day to the hospital. She cleaned their wounds with careful fingers. She held the old people gently. When the babies cried, she sang: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!Some nights Albertina worked till dawn. She looked out the window and thought of her family. Were the children hungry? Did they go to school? Who was riding Shishi? She remembered the dark green spinach. She missed the scent of the earth. There was no vegetable garden here. There was nowhere for a horse.Albertina never went to parties. She saved every shilling. On her days off she learned to play tennis. Whoosh! Plop! She whacked the ball across the net. Always, she wished for a little more money to send home.
Walter Sisulu was a brave and clever man who dreamed of freedom for South Africa. His big smile captured Albertina’s eye. They walked together down the city streets. Her delicate hand rested on his arm. Walter wanted Albertina to be the mother of his children.Bright ribbons decorated the Bantu Men’s Social Centre on their wedding day. Albertina’s long-sleeved dress had a swirling train of lace. Many friends blessed their special day. Albertina planted flowers in her little garden. Within a year, Max was born. Albertina had become a mother. One day people would call her the mother of the nation.Max had his mother’s black button eyes and his father’s round chin. He was the hope for their future. Albertina wanted to fight for a new South Africa, so that Max could be free. When he cried, she sang: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”
Police came in the middle of the night, banging on the door. Albertina scolded the men who messed up her house. “How rude you are!” she said, “trampling mud inside my home.”In the morning Albertina’s favourite flowers lay crushed beneath their footprints. She remembered chasing the chickens from her vegetable garden back in Xolobe and set about replanting her garden. The earth, she knew, would recover.She would support her husband who kept many secrets and hid from the police.
She joined the women and worked to organise a march to Pretoria. The women refused to carry a pass. They sang, “Wathint’ abafazi; wathint’ imbokodo! You strike a woman; you strike a rock!”Many hard years followed after Walter’s arrest. He was jailed on Robben Island for 26 years. Albertina, also, was sent to jail many times. Often she was scared. Often she was lonely.But even on the darkest nights, she could see a sliver of moon through the window in her cell. She sang the song that Ma Monikazi sang before she was born: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”
It had been raining for days, and everyone was grumpy. Everyone except Sizwe, who woke up with a smile every morning. "Yoh! Sizwe! That smile is magic!" said Gogo. "Is it for me?" Sizwe clapped his hand over his mouth. "But it's MY smile, Gogo," he whispered.
His mother laughed. "Sizwe! A smile is something you can give away without losing it. Look!" She lifted him up to the mirror. There was his smile, just as bright as before.
It was time to go out. Mama buttoned up Sizwe's raincoat, and off they went, through the rain,  to the library. Down the street, Sizwe's best friend Zanele stood at the window of her house,  looking sadly at the rain. Sizwe felt his smile creeping, creeping up. Before he knew it, his smile LEAPT out, and flew across the garden to Zanele.
Zanele held on tightly to the smile – it was far too precious to let it get away. As Sizwe walked away to the library, Zanele's doorbell rang. It was the postman, with a letter from her favourite cousin. Zanele was so happy, that the smile bounced up,  and beamed out at the postman. "Thank you,  Mister Postman!" she said.
Zanele's smile was the brightest thing the postman had seen all morning. It kept him warm as he trudged off through the rain. He came to a big house. Inside the gate, a dog was spinning around in circles, barking, barking, barking. He was so silly,  that the postman couldn't help smiling. The smile bounced through the gate with a glitter of glee.
The dog stopped barking. He pricked up his ears and wagged his tail. Then he turned and ran back to the house with the precious, warm smile. A bent old man opened the door. "Oh,  no! You can't come inside. You're all wet!" he told the dog. But right away, the smile beamed up at the old man.
The old man stood a little straighter. "Eish," he said,  "Who cares if it's raining? Let's go for a walk,  boy!" And off they went, splashing in the puddles. There,  at the zebra crossing, stood grumpy Mrs Makabela,  the traffic cop. She looked cold, and wet,  and miserable. The old man knew just what to do. "Morning, Mrs Makabela!" he called, and smiled his biggest, brightest smile. But Mrs Makabela did not smile back.
A great, big smile lit up Mrs Makabela's face! The school bell rang, and children ran to cross the road. Mrs Makabela put up her sign, and smiled, and smiled, at each and every child.
The children smiled at their moms and dads, and their gogos and tatas and brothers and sisters. They smiled at the bus driver and the greengrocer, and Mme Makau, who went off to smile at her husband,  who smiled at the mayor. The smiles leapt and rolled and beamed and gleamed until EVERYONE was smiling and giggling and laughing out loud in the rain.
In the library, everything was quiet except for the sound of the rain. "It's time to go," said Sizwe's mother, closing her book. "Aw,  mom!" said Sizwe,  who had run out of smiles.
But as they stepped out into the street  WHAT A SIGHT! Everyone in town was there! Everyone!  And they were ALL smiling!
The smiles bounced around and beamed at Sizwe. They warmed him, and tickled him, and crept up,  up, up from his toes to the TOP of his head. He was so full of happiness that the smile burst out, brilliant and beaming bright. And something changed. The dark, gloomy, rainy afternoon didn't seem so dark anymore. Could it be? YES! The clouds parted,  and the warm sun shone down on them, with the biggest, brightest, most brilliant smile of all.
Little Ant loved to read. Little Ant was often teased. "Ants don't read. Ants must feed. Ants collect the food they need."
Little Ant would read all day, he'd read and read the day away.
The other ants took what they found to store for winter underground.
His mum and dad got really mad, and Little Ant felt really bad.
In autumn when the leaves fall down, the ants must keep food underground.
The Queen wants food to fill the store, so all the ants must work some more.
Little Ant begins to shout about a place he read about. "A restaurant is what we need, a place where people go to feed. It says so in the books I read."
The ants go marching one by one. They march into the setting sun.
And Little Ant said, "Hey,  there's one!"
The ants go marching one by one, carrying a burger,  carrying a bun.
When they return the Queen is glad. The stores are full. They cheer like mad.
Ant gets hugs from mum and dad.
His baby sister takes his hand, "Now I think I understand. The way you love to read a book makes me want to take a look."
"No Nomvula,  don't play with water. It is so scarce!" "But it's hot,  Mama! I feel like getting into this water. I want to be cool."
"No,  Nomvula. Don't play with water. Water is scarce." "But it's hot,  Mama,  I'm thirsty. I'd like to drink cold water."
It is raining. There is going to be a lot of water. Now I can't play – I wish it could be hot.
Look at the vegetables. They are growing and becoming green. Look! The bowls and buckets are overflowing with water.
It has stopped raining. Now we can play! Look how beautiful everything is after the rain. The sky is clear and blue. Trees and grass are green,  and the plants are flowering.
Oh no! There the rain is again! When are we going to play?
Oh no,  me! I'm going to play,  even if it's raining! Oh it's so lovely to play in the rain. Chapha chapha chapha! Imanz'ilokhwe yam! Imanz'ilokhwe yam! Chapha chapha chapha! Zimanz'iinwele zam! Zimanz'iinwele zam!
Nomvula,  you don't want to listen,  my child. Come closer,  let me dry and comb your hair. Chapha chapha chapha! Zimanz'iinwele zakho! Zimanz'iinwele zakho!
Odongo and Apiyo lived in the city with their father. They looked forward to the holidays. Not only because school was closed, but because they went to visit their grandmother. She lived in a fishing village near a large lake.
Odongo and Apiyo were excited because it was time to visit their grandmother again. They packed their bags and got ready for their long journey the next day. They could not sleep and talked about the holiday the whole night.
Early the next morning, they left for the village in their father's car. They drove past mountains, wild animals, and tea plantations. They counted cars and sang songs.
After a while, the children were tired and fell asleep.
Father woke up Odongo and Apiyo as they arrived in the village. They found Nyar-Kanyada, their grandmother, resting on a mat under a tree. In thier language, Nyar-Kanyada means “daughter of the people of Kanyada.” She was a strong and beautiful woman.
Nyar-Kanyada welcomed them into the house. She danced around the room singing with joy. Her grandchildren were excited to give her the presents they brought from the city. “First open my gift,” said Odongo. “No, my gift first!” said Apiyo.
After she opened the presents, Nyar-Kanyada blessed her grandchildren in a traditional way.
Then Odongo and Apiyo went outside. They chased butterflies and birds.
They climbed trees and splashed in the water of the lake.
When it was dark they returned to the house for dinner. Before they could finish eating, they were falling asleep!
The next day, the children's father drove back to the city leaving them with Nyar-Kanyada.
Odongo and Apiyo helped their grandmother with household chores. They fetched water and firewood. They collected eggs from the chickens and picked vegetables from the garden.
Nyar-Kanyada taught her grandchildren to make soft ugali to eat with stew. She showed them how to make coconut rice to eat with roast fish.
One morning, Odongo took his grandmother's cows to graze. They ran onto a neighbour's farm. The farmer was angry with Odongo. He threatened to keep the cows for eating his crops. After that day, the boy made sure that the cows did not get into trouble again.
On another day, the children went to the market place with Nyar­Kanyada.She had a stall selling vegetables, sugar and soap. Apiyo liked to tell customers the price of items. Odongo would pack the items that customers bought.
At the end of the day they drank chai tea together. They helped grandmother to count the money she earned.
But too soon the holidays were over. The children had to go back to the city. Nyar-Kanyada gave Odongo a cap and Apiyo a sweater. She packed food for their journey.
When their father came to fetch them, they did not want to leave. The children begged Nyar-Kanyada to go with them to the city. She smiled and said, “I am too old for the city. I will be waiting for you to visit me again.”
Odongo and Apiyo both hugged her tightly, and said goodbye.
When Odongo and Apiyo went back to school they told their friends about life in the village. Some children felt that life in the city was good. Others felt that the village was better. But most of all, everyone agreed that Odongo and Apiyo had a wonderful grandmother!
In my home village,  there is a trader called Dembe.
Dembe has a big shop in the village.
The shop sells flour,  sugar,  rice,  beans,  and many more things.
Dembe and his wife have three children. The children help in the shop during the holidays.
Each day,  Dembe adds up the money they earned.
Dembe has a business book. In the book he writes the amount they earn each day. He also writes what they spend to buy things for the shop.
Dembe and his wife can afford a big house and a car.
They also keep cows,  chickens and rabbits.
This family has a good life. One day,  the children will take over the shop. But first they will finish school.

Ghum-Ghum lives by the great river Ganga with her big, noisy family of gharials. She goes swimming every day, to catch insects and fish for her lunch. Ghum-Ghum meets all kinds of creatures on her daily swims: dolphins, otters, snails, water birds, fishermen in boats, buffaloes, snakes, and many others. How many of Ghum-Ghum's river friends can you spot in this page and the next?

The Winter cold had passed. Spring was coming to Nkanyezi's village. Soon the villagers would gather to celebrate the new season. Nkanyezi looked forward to the Spring festival more than any other day in the year.
One warm morning, Nkanyezi overheard two village elders talking about the festival. "The people of Ndlovu have lost their spirit of celebration," one sighed. "How can we have a Spring festival in a village that has forgotten how to celebrate?" asked another.
Nkanyezi was worried. "How will the sun shine again unless we sing to wake it from its winter slumber?" she asked herself. Nkanyezi thought for a long time. "I must find what we have lost," she decided. "I must go in search of things that will bring back the spirit of celebration to my village."
The elders gave Nkanyezi their blessing for the journey. They gave her a bag to carry the things she would find. Nkanyezi was afraid, but she believed she would succeed.
Nkanyezi walked all day. She hiked up a hill, and down into a valley. She sailed across the great river, and climbed between sharp rocks. She marched across the plains until she reached the shadow of the red mountains.
As night was closing in, Nkanyezi arrived at a village of patterns and colours as she had never seen before. She told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people.The mother of this tribe gave Nkanyezi a gift. She told the girl, "With love we give to you this paint to restore colour to your village." Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the paint in her bag. Early the next morning she went on her way.
Nkanyezi walked all day, through a vast forest of giant trees. As the sky became too dark for her to see, she heard the sound of beating drums. She hurried towards the drumming, feeling the spirit of dance coming to her tired feet.
Nkanyezi found herself in the village of the Bhubezi. People were sitting around a fire, drumming and singing. She had never before heard such wonderful music. She told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people. The Bhubezi invited her to rest and stay the night.
In the morning the chief called on Nkanyezi. "My child," he said, "here is a special drum. It plays a new song every time you beat it." Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the drum in her bag. She went on her way again, delighted with this gift of music and dance.
On the third day of her journey, as she passed a field of fat cows, her nose started to tingle. An aroma tickled her taste buds and her mouth started to water. She followed the scent, and arrived in a village to find people standing over steaming pots of stew. This tribe was famous for its feasts and Nkanyezi had never before tasted such flavours. After she had eaten her fill, she told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people.
The next day, the council of cooks gave her a secret spice blend. "Our daughter," they said, "with these spices, happy tummies are guaranteed! We give you the gift of good food." Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the spices in her bag. She knew she had everything she needed. With new energy she started the long journey back to the village of Ndlovu.
When she arrived home the villagers gathered around her to hear of her adventures. She told them the tales of what she had seen, heard, and eaten. Then she opened her bag to share the gifts given. The villagers rejoiced to receive these treasures. The generosity of others and the courage of Nkanyezi brought back colour, song and dance to the people.  And so the spirit of celebration was restored to the village of Ndlovu.
All of us went to the fun fair.
Father bought brother fancy glasses. Mother bought me a bright blue cap. The baby got sugar candy.
On the way home,  a very strong wind came. It blew my cap away.
My cap got stuck on a branch of a big old tree.
I cried a lot. And I did not eat my dinner.
Later that night,  the moon came up. It looked at my cap in the big old tree.
The moon tried on my cap. It smiled happily. I had to smile too.
After school the next day,  my mother gave me a shiny new red cap. "The moon sent it," she said.
That night,  both the moon and I wore our caps and smiled. We were happy.
Do you think the sun needs a hat?
Guess which cap I am wearing today!

Many years ago,  the Lizard and the Frog were friends. One day  they decided to look for girlfriends in the city.
The Frog was jealous of  the Lizard's shining and brilliant skin.
He said,  "What did you do to look so beautiful? Look at me,  I am so ugly. What can I do about my skin?"
The Lizard said,  "Listen! Put some water in a pot and put it on the fire. Next you....."
But the Frog said,  "I know already,  I know! Keep quiet,  my friend!" And he left.
Frog arrived home and put some water in a pot.
When the water began to boil,  he threw himself into it.
His skin was burnt and his tail came off!
Instead of being brilliant and beautiful like the Lizard,  he was even more ugly!

One day, mama bought different fruits.
"When can we have some fruit?" we asked. "We will eat the fruit tonight," said mama.
My brother Rahim is greedy. He tasted all the fruit. He ate a lot of it.
"Look at what Rahim did!" shouted my little brother. "Rahim is naughty and selfish," I said.
Mama was angry with Rahim.
We were also angry with Rahim. But Rahim was not sorry.
"Are you going to punish Rahim?" asked little brother.
"Rahim, you will be sorry soon," warned mama.
Rahim started feeling unwell.
"My stomach is painful," whispered Rahim.
Mama knew why Rahim was sick. "The fruit is punishing Rahim," she thought.
Later, Rahim said sorry to us. "I will never be so greedy again," he promised. We believed him.

Baboon and Crocodile were the best of friends. They played together. They ate together. They did everything together.
But one day,  Crocodile got very sick. He was close to dying. Crocodile went to the nyabezi. "If you want to get better,  you have to eat baboon meat," said the nyabenzi.
When he heard this, Crocodile cried. If he wanted to get better, he had no choice than to eat his friend the baboon.
When Baboon went to see his friend, he got on Crocodile's back. Crocodile took Baboon out to the deepest part of the river.
"What is troubling you, my friend?" asked Baboon.Crocodile said, "The nyabezi told me that if I want to get better I must eat you, my friend."
Baboon replied,  "No, don't eat me. I'm too small!Wait a minute and I'll call my grandfather. He's bigger than me. Eat him and you'll be full."
Crocodile said,  "Where is this grandfather of yours?"Baboon replied,  "He's in the tree on that island." Crocodile said,  "Go and get him so that I may eat him."
Baboon jumped off Crocodile's back and ran straight up the tree. Crocodile waited and waited. But Baboon did not return. And that was the end of their friendship.
Long, long ago, when Zebra's skin was still white, a terrible drought occurred. For months not a single drop of rain fell. The grass turned dull, the trees became bare and the rivers dried up one by one. Springbok, Warthog and Zebra had to walk very far each day in search of water.
One morning when Springbok arrived at the only watering hole, he heard an angry voice say, “Make way! Scoot! Or heads will roll! This is Baboon's watering hole!” Springbok's eyes widened. Baboon was sitting on a rock next to the watering hole, grilling bananas over his open fire. “But I'm so thirsty, my tongue feels like biltong,” Springbok said. “Where will I find water?”
Baboon growled. “Not my problem! Scoot! Or heads will roll! This is Baboon's watering hole.” Springbok saw Baboon's long teeth and was scared. He turned around and trotted away.
After a while Warthog came trotting along. But as soon as he lowered his head to take a sip of water, he heard an angry voice, “Make way!Scoot! Or heads will roll! This is Baboon's watering hole!” Surprised, Warthog turned around. He saw Baboon sitting on the rock next to the watering hole grilling his bananas.
“But I'm so thirsty, it feels as if I've eaten dust,” Warthog said. "Where will I find water?" Baboon growled. “Not my problem! Scoot! Or heads will roll! This is Baboon's watering hole.” Warthog bristled at first, but when he saw Baboon's long teeth, he got scared. He turned around and trotted away, tail in the air.
After a while Zebra turned up at the watering hole. Before he could take a sip of water he heard an angry voice. “Make way! Scoot! Or heads will roll! This is Baboon's watering hole!” Zebra snorted and looked up. He saw Baboon sitting on the rock grilling his bananas.
“But I'm so thirsty, it feels as if my tongue slept outside my mouth last night,” Zebra said. “Where will I find water?” “Not my problem! Scoot! Or heads will roll!This is Baboon's watering hole.” Baboon showed his long teeth. Zebra wasn't scared. With clip-clopping hooves he stormed atbaboon. He was so angry that he ran right through Baboon's burning fire. Sparks and smoke and bananas were flying.
Baboon tried to escape, but it was too late. Zebra kicked him so hard that he flew through the air. “Ouch!” Baboon yelled. His butt landed on a sun baked rock. The rock was so hot that it burned off Baboon's hair. From that day Baboon has never had hair on his butt.
And Zebra's skin has never been lilywhite again. Baboon's fire burned stripes onto his skin.
It was now safe for the animals to drink at the watering hole. And each morning, as they came to drink water, Springbok, Warthog and Zebra sang, “Come wet your throat here while you stroll, this is everybody's watering hole!
There once lived a chicken, called Cikizwa, who was an orphan.One day Cikizwa was out looking for food when she saw a mole coming out of his hole. She started speaking to the mole, but he ignored her.
From that day on, the mole and Cikizwa became great friends. The friends often hugged each other tightly. They loved and looked after each other.
Elephant often said really unkind things to Cikizwa to try and make her unhappy. One morning, when Cikizwa greeted Elephant, he snubbed her and said, “Ha, ha, ha! Go away, you orphan! What do you want from me? You’re so skinny. It’s as if you haven’t had enough mealies to eat!” Cikizwa was heartbroken.
The next day it rained and rained. It rained so heavily that many animals were swept away by the nearby river. Cikizwa was safe in her little coop because her father had been clever enough to build a drain nearby so that it didn’t get flooded.
But Cikizwa still felt sad about what had happened to some of her friends.Once the rain stopped, beautiful, colourful flowers appeared and there was a cool breeze. Cikizwa was out enjoying the sunshine when she saw Elephant limping along and crying loudly. Kind Cikizwa quickly called an ambulance.
When the ambulance arrived, Elephant got the help he needed. His leg was bandaged and he was given an injection to help with the pain. As soon as Elephant started to feel better, he thanked Cikizwa for her kindness.Then he said, “Cikizwa, my child, never change who you are. Keep on respecting and loving everyone.”
But Gumbi and Cikizwa didn’t care. They became even closer. Gumbi taught Cikizwa how to swim and dive, and Cikizwa taught Gumbi how to scratch in the sand for food.Eventually Gumbi asked Cikizwa to marry him. Cikizwa agreed immediately. Together they decided to have their wedding the following Saturday at a place that they both loved near the river.
Their wedding day arrived. The sun was blazing hot. What a wonderful wedding it was!The animal choir sang beautifully. Iguanas, whales, crocodiles, seals, sharks, dolphins, sheep, cattle, dogs, antelopes, hares, porcupines, water snakes and other animals all sang together:“It is enjoyable here at the wedding of the fish. It is enjoyable here at the wedding of the chicken!”
Long time ago, in the village of Elunyiko, there lived a man called Ndonga and his wife called Namukhaywa. They had six children. All of them were girls.
When Namukhaywa was pregnant with her seventh child, Ndonga warned her, "If you give birth to another girl, I will leave you. But if you give me a baby boy, I will hold a big party for you!"
When it was time to give birth, Namukhaywa went to the traditional midwife. Would the child be a girl or a boy?
It was a boy AND a girl – twins! She called the boy Mukhwana, and the girl she called Mulongo. As she looked at Mukhwana, she was very happy. But as she looked at Mulongo, she felt sad. She felt that there was only one thing she could do.
Namukhaywa left Mulongo in the care of the midwife and took Mukhwana home to her husband.
She proudly showed Ndonga the baby boy. He was very happy and called all the villagers to celebrate the birth of his son.
Mukhwana grew up to be a fine young man. And Mulongo grew up to be a fine young woman.
One day, while minding his father's cattle, Mukhwana saw a very beautiful girl. "This is the girl I want to marry," he said to himself.
But when he asked her to marry him, she sang this song: Mukhwana wefwe, Mukhwana. So yakhupa omunwa, Mukhwana. Nebebula omukhana, Mukhwana. Barulaka khulwanda, Mukhwana. Nebebula omusiani, Mukhwana. Barera mungo muno, Mukhwana. Iyeyi yakwa, Mukhwana. Iyindi yakwa, Mukhwana.
This happened again and again. Mukhwana did not know what to do. He went to his mother, Namukhaywa. "I have found a beautiful girl," he said. "And I want to marry her. But every time I ask her, she sings the same song."
To his surprise, Namukhaywa said, "What the girl is singing about is true. That is your sister. You were born twins. Your father wanted a son, not a daughter. So I left your baby sister with the midwife, and brought you home to your father."
When Mukhwana told his father the story, he saw that he had been wrong. He called Namukhaywa and together they went to the midwife to fetch Mulongo.
When Mulongo arrived home, her father and the village elders slaughtered a goat and performed the traditional ceremony for re-uniting Mulongo and her seven siblings.
A year later, Mulongo was married to the son of the rich king of that village. She brought a lot of wealth and happiness to her family.
Once upon a time, there was a goat called Igodhoobe*. Igodhoobe the goat was the king of farm animals and birds. He lived a good life. One day, Igodhoobe the goat called all the animals and birds to a meeting.*pronounced ee-god-who-buhe
"My friends, I have called you because I had a dream," said the goat. All the animals and birds kept quiet. They listened to their king carefully.
"I dreamed that there was no food or water left in the land. Many of our relatives died!" said the king. When the animals and the birds heard the dream, they were worried. "What shall we do?" asked the cat.
The hen and the duck had an idea. They said, "Let each one of us bring food and put it in the king's store." All the animals agreed with this idea.
The king made a rule. He said, "Get ropes. Tie up anyone who does not bring food to my store. Then carry him to me."
But, soon after this, it was time for a new king to rule over the farm. All the animals and birds met and elected the cat as their new king.
But the goat refused to agree that the cat was king. "I'm the king. There is no other king. I can't obey any other animal," said the goat.
The animals took food to the new king's store. But the goat did not take anything. "When the goat was king, we all obeyed him. Now he does not want to obey our new king. What shall we do?" asked the cow.
All the domestic animals and birds were angry. "He thinks he is different to us," they all muttered.
The dog said, "I helped him when he was king. I did not sleep at night. I was always with him, ready to help."
The sheep said, "I gave him my wool to cover his children."
The pig said, "When he was king, he told his friends that I eat a lot. But I was often in his garden digging and weeding his maize and millet."
The sheep asked, "What did he say? That you eat a lot? Did he think that he will be king forever?" Then the sheep added, "Let him understand that he is not king any more. I don't know why he thinks he is so important."
All the animals laughed and agreed that the goat must take food to the new king. King Cat ordered the goat to come to him.
When the animals went to fetch the goat, he was sitting on a chair with his legs crossed. "I shall not go to the cat. There is no other king except me. When you become a king, you are always a king," said the goat.
"We will tie you with ropes and take you to the new king," said the sheep.
So the cow tied the goat to her tail. She then pulled him to the king. The sheep, the duck, the dog, the pig, and the cock cheered as the cow pulled the goat. They all shouted, "Take this stubborn goat to our new king!"
From that time, every goat refuses to move when it is pulled. It thinks that you are taking it to the king's court.
Have you ever seen a herd of cows in the field? Every now and then you will notice a cow shaking her head. She tries to drive away the flies that pester her. But why do the flies zoom-zoom­zee around Cow's head?
They say it started long, long ago in a far-off country. The country's queen was very rich and had a kind heart. One day she decided to arrange a huge banquet. All the animals were invited. The enormous tables were beautifully laden. Every table groaned under the delicacies, dishes full of meat, freshly baked bread, steaming vegetables and honey-sweet fruit.
The animals smacked their lips when they saw the delicious food. “The largest animal at each table should sit at the head,” the queen said. “It is his or her job to dish out the food.” Cow shared a table with Sheep, Goat, Dog, Goose and Fly. Since Cow was the biggest, she started dishing out the food. Each animal received a big chunk of home-baked bread with grape jam and cheese.
But because Fly was so small, Cow hardly noticed her. “Zoom! Zoom! Zee! What about me? I'd also like something to eat, you see?” Fly grumbled. But Cow pretended not to hear Fly. She tucked into the delicious bread. Poor Fly sat there deprived of everything, watching the other animals eat.
When they had finished the last crumb of bread, Cow started dishing out the meat and vegetables. Each animal received a large plate of food. But because Fly was so small, Cow once again hardly noticed her. “Zoom! Zoom! Zee! What about me? I'd also like something to eat, you see?” Fly grumbled louder than before. Cow rolled her eyes and was annoyed with Fly.
“Hey! Where are your manners?” Cow said. “A bug like you doesn't even belong at the queen's banquet. You can wait until the bigger animals have finished.” The food was finished in two ticks. Poor Fly didn't receive the tiniest morsel. Cow started sharing the fruit. There were delicious water melon, juicy spanspek and red-cheeked apples.
All the animals received food, but Fly had to go without it. “Zoom! Zoom! Zee! What about me? I'd also like something to eat, you see?” Fly complained. Cow laughed and took a bite from her apple. “Do you hear something?” she asked the other animals at the table. “I don't hear anything.” In a jiffy all the food at the table had been finished. The animals were overstuffed. Everyone except Fly. Her tummy growled with hunger.
After the meal it was time to dance and be merry. But Fly was angry. She decided to go home. The queen noticed Fly. “Why are you leaving, Fly?” the queen asked. “Don't you enjoy my banquet?” Fly curtsied before the queen. “I'm sorry, your Majesty,” she said. “I'm sure the food was delicious. But I didn't have a tiny morsel of food.” And she told the queen what had happened. The queen was very angry when she heard what Cow had done.
“From now on you and your friends may pester Cow every day,” the queen said. “From morning till night you may buzz around her ears. It will teach her a lesson. She will never be able to ignore you again. And she'll see that even the tiniest insect is important to me.”
And that is exactly what Fly has been doing until today. She and her friends buzz around Cow's ears from morning till night. And while they are doing it, they sing: “Zoom! Zoom! Zee! Never ever again, Can you ignore us. Say amen!”

And children talk.
In a village on the slopes of Mount Kenya in East Africa,  a little girl worked in the fields with her mother. Her name was Wangari.
Wangari loved being outside. In her family's food garden she broke up the soil with her machete. She pressed tiny seeds into the warm earth.
Her favourite time of day was just after sunset. When it got too dark to see the plants,  Wangari knew it was time to go home. She would follow the narrow paths through the fields,  crossing rivers as she went.
Wangari was a clever child and couldn't wait to go to school. But her mother and father wanted her to stay and help them at home. When she was seven years old,  her big brother persuaded her parents to let her go to school.
She liked to learn! Wangari learnt more and more with every book she read. She did so well at school that she was invited to study in the United States of America. Wangari was excited! She wanted to know more about the world.
At the American university Wangari learnt many new things. She studied plants and how they grow. And she remembered how she grew: playing games with her brothers in the shade of the trees in the beautiful Kenyan forests.
The more she learnt,  the more she realised that she loved the people of Kenya. She wanted them to be happy and free. The more she learnt,  the more she remembered her African home.
When she had finished her studies,  she returned to Kenya. But her country had changed. Huge farms stretched across the land. Women had no wood to make cooking fires. The people were poor and the children were hungry.
Wangari knew what to do. She taught the women how to plant trees from seeds. The women sold the trees and used the money to look after their families. The women were very happy. Wangari had helped them to feel powerful and strong.
As time passed,  the new trees grew into forests,  and the rivers started flowing again. Wangari's message spread across Africa. Today,  millions of trees have grown from Wangari's seeds.
Wangari had worked hard. People all over the world took notice,  and gave her a famous prize. It is called the Nobel Peace Prize,  and she was the first African woman ever to receive it.
Wangari died in 2011,  but we can think of her every time we see a beautiful tree.
It is nearly break time at Siyafunda Primary School. The two spaza shop owners at the school are preparing lunch to sell to hungry children.
In Mr Motaung’s shop, the bread is cut and ready for making kotas. He carefully cuts out the soft middle of each quarter loaf. Then he puts polony and chips in the space inside. Motaung puts two spoonfuls of his wife’s homemade atchar in each kota. He likes to boast that his kotas have atchar inside and atchar on top!
In Mr Mkhize’s shop, the chips are nearly ready, but he is still cutting his bread for kotas. He is worried because things are not going well with his shop. “It started well,” thinks Mkhize. “But now I get fewer and fewer customers. At least I’m reducing some of my costs by cutting five kotas from a loaf.”
Jabu and Zodwa are buying lunch. Zodwa buys from Mr Mkhize. Jabu buys from Mr Motaung. He believes that Motaung’s kota has got more chips and atchar than Mkhize’s kota.
The queue at Mr Motaung’s shop is always longer. Zodwa waits for Jabu. Then the friends sit together in the shade to enjoy their kotas.
Zodwa notices something that makes her stare and frown. “What are you staring at?” asks Jabu. “Your kota! It looks bigger than mine,” says Zodwa.
They both look very closely at their kotas. Sure enough, Jabu’s is bigger. “Something is not right here,” says Zodwa. “I wonder if this is the reason Mr Mkhize’s shop is not busy anymore.” Jabu thinks for a while and then he replies, “Well, I heard that some kids saw Mkhize cutting his bread into five pieces for kotas!”
Nomsa overhears Jabu and Zodwa talking and she’s curious. She asks them what’s wrong with cutting the loaf into five pieces for kotas. Zodwa and Jabu reply together, “A kota is a quarter of a loaf!” Nomsa still looks confused, so Zodwa explains, “The loaf must be cut into four equal pieces. Otherwise, they are not quarters.”
Nomsa is cross because she also buys from Mr Mkhize. “So, he is stealing bread from us!” she says in a loud voice. Zodwa decides to go back to Mkhize’s shop to complain. She marches off, holding her kota up in the air. Nomsa hurries behind her. Jabu sighs and gets up to follow his friends.
Mr Mkhize is disappointed when he sees that the children aren’t new customers. “Oh, hello again kids,” he mutters, “how can I help you?” “Mr Mkhize, I asked you for a quarter and I paid you for a quarter. But this is not a quarter,” says Zodwa, pointing at her kota. “I want a quarter kota or my money back,” she adds firmly.
“Is it true Mr Mkhize? You’ve been cheating us!” cries Nomsa. A few children have followed them to the shop and are now listening to the fierce accusations. Mkhize waves his hands wildly. “What are you saying about me?” he protests. “I’m not like that! I want you to get out of my shop now!”
Then Zodwa says quietly, “We will tell everyone what you are doing. It will spread like wildfire throughout the school. You will have to close your shop. No one will come and buy from you!” Mr Mkhize looks at the three children standing in front of him. Then he looks at the growing crowd outside his shop.
“OK,” he says eventually, “I will give you your money back. “And also promise that you will cut each loaf into quarters for your kotas,” speaks up Jabu. Mr Mkhize promises that he will. Then he clears his throat and says loud enough for everyone to hear, “I also promise that I will add more atchar and more chips to my kotas.”
Mr Mkhize did indeed add extra chips and atchaar to his kotas. Soon more children were buying from him, and his shop started doing well. He was even able to hire someone to help him.
Now there is a healthy competition between Mr Mkhize and Mr Motaung, and everyone is happy.
Once long ago,  the birds had a meeting. They wanted a king.
The Eagle wanted to be king. The other birds said,  "Your call is too sad to be king." The Ostrich wanted to be king. The other birds said,  "You can't fly."
Peacock wanted to be king. The other birds said,  "You are too proud. You cannot be king." Owl wanted to be king. The other birds said,  "You sleep during the day. You cannot be king."
And so they did not get too far. Then one bird said,  "Who can fly the highest? That bird should be king." All the birds flew up up up into the sky.
Goose flew over the highest mountains in the world. Eagle flew into the blue above the mountains. But Vulture flew without stopping,  up towards the sun.
High above them,  the birds heard Vulture cry,  "I am the highest,  I am king!"
Vulture heard a tiny voice,  "Tink,  tink,  tink! I am the highest,  I am king." It was Ncede,  the Neddicky,  the smallest bird of all! He had held onto the feathers of Vulture as he flew up into the sky!
So Vulture flew down with the little bird still under his wing. The other birds were cross with Ncede. They waited for him,  ready to pluck out all his feathers.
But the quick little bird saw how angry they were,  and flew into an empty snake hole.
The birds told Owl to wait near the hole and catch him when he comes out. So Owl sat in front of the hole.
But the sun was warm and soon Owl was fast asleep. The little bird peeped out,  saw that Owl was asleep,  and z-zip,  away he went.
Owl was very ashamed that he had let the little bird escape. Now he only hunts at night. In the day,  he sleeps,  away from the sight of the other birds.
The Winter cold had passed. Spring was coming to Nkanyezi’s village. Soon the villagers would gather to celebrate the new season. Nkanyezi looked forward to the Spring festival more than any other day in the year.
One warm morning, Nkanyezi overheard two village elders talking about the festival.“The people of Ndlovu have lost their spirit of celebration,” one sighed.“How can we have a Spring festival in a village that has forgotten how to celebrate?” asked another.
Nkanyezi was worried. “How will the sun shine again unless we sing to wake it from its winter slumber?” she asked herself.Nkanyezi thought for a long time.“I must find what we have lost,” she decided.“I must go in search of things that will bring back the spirit of celebration to my village.”
The elders gave Nkanyezi their blessing for the journey. They gave her a bag to carry the things she would find.Nkanyezi was afraid, but she believed she would succeed.
Nkanyezi walked all day. She hiked up a hill, and down into a valley. She sailed across the great river, and climbed between sharp rocks. She marched across the plains until she reached the shadow of the red mountains.
As night was closing in, Nkanyezi arrived at a village of patterns and colours as she had never seen before. She told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people. The mother of this tribe gave Nkanyezi a gift.She told the girl, “With love we give to you this paint to restore colour to a village that has gone dull.”Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the paint in her bag. Early the next morning she went on her way again, excited with this gift of colour.
Nkanyezi walked all day, through a vast forest of giant trees. As the sky became too dark for her to see, she heard the sound of beating drums. She hurried towards the drumming, feeling the spirit of dance coming to her tired feet
Nkanyezi found herself in the village of the Bhubezi. People were sitting around a fire, drumming and singing. She had never before heard such wonderful music.She told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people. The Bhubezi invited her to rest and stay the night.
In the morning the chief called on Nkanyezi.“My child,” he said, “here is a special drum. It plays a new song every time you beat it.” Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the drum in her bag. She went on her way again, delighted with this gift of music and dance.
On the third day of her journey, as she passed a field of fat cows, her nose started to tingle. An aroma tickled her taste buds and her mouth started to water. She followed the scent, and arrived in a village to find people standing over steaming pots of stew.This tribe was famous for its feasts and Nkanyezi had never before tasted such flavours. After she had eaten her fill, she told the village elders about her journey to bring back the spirit of celebration to her people.
The next day, the council of cooks gave her a secret spice blend.“Our daughter,” they said, “with these spices, happy tummies are guaranteed! We give you the gift of good food.”Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the spices in her bag. She knew she had everything she needed.With new energy she started the long journey back to the village of Ndlovu.
When she arrived home the villagers gathered around her to hear of her adventures. She told them the tales of what she had seen, heard, and eaten. Then she opened her bag to share the gifts given. The people rejoiced to receive these treasures.Through the generosity of others and the courage of Nkanyezi, the villagers again found the colour, song and dance in their lives. And so the spirit of celebration was restored to the village of Ndlovu.
Long ago Hen and Eagle were friends. One day,  Eagle found Hen under a tree resting with her hopping bags. Hen was standing on one leg.
Eagle asked Hen,  "Where is your other leg?"
Hen told Eagle,  "The shopkeeper cut off my leg and gave me these groceries in return."
Eagle asked Hen whether he could do the same. He also wanted a bag of groceries. Hen agreed.
Eagle went to the shopkeeper and asked her to cut off one of his legs in exchange for groceries. The shopkeeper accepted.
The eagle hopped on one leg all the way home. But he was happy with the things the shopkeeper gave him.
When Eagle reached home,  he found Hen with both her legs.
Eagle was furious and chased Hen. But he never caught her. Instead,  Eagle always looks out for Hen's children. Whenever he catches one,  he eats it.
Hello! My name is Nanu. I am waiting with my mother for a taxi. We are going home.
Here I am standing in line. My mother sings me a song. "Come Mr Taxi can't you see? We are waiting,  Nanu and me!"
The lady next to me is taking her chickens home. They will lay eggs for her to eat.
These men are coming back from work. They smile at me. I hear them sing,  "Hey little Nanu,  don't you worry. Taxi's coming in a hurry."
A lady walks past. She is a very smart lady. Aren't her shoes beautiful? They go "click,  click,  clickclick,  click,  click" when she walks.
This man is selling cold drinks. I love cold drinks. They are so cold and sweet. Do you like them?
Look! There are ladies taking their supper home on their heads. Aren't they clever?
That lady is having her hair done. She is going out with her friends tonight.
I am tired now. My mother puts me on her back where I can rest. She sings,  "Please Mr Taxi,  don't be late,  Gogo is waiting at our gate."
There is my friend Tumi. He is also resting. We will be home soon.
High up there the birds are flying home. They must get home before it is dark.
This lady has beautiful earrings. I think she bought them in town today. When I grow up I will buy many earrings for me and my mother.
My mother is getting tired now. I sing her a song,  "Please Mr Taxi,  won't you come,  we are waiting,  me and mum."
Wait! I can hear the taxi! Here it comes!
This is our big red taxi. It has come to take me and my mother home. I am very happy!
Goodbye!
They closed the schools, and sent us home.

Mother is worried about Uncle.He is sick in hospital.
Our parents are worried about everything.
Everyone is worried about getting sick from this virus.
All we hear about is the coronavirus!I wish it would go away!
Have you ever seen a herd of cows in the field? Every now and then you will notice a cow shaking her head. She tries to drive away the flies that pester her. But why do the flies zoom-zoom-zee around Cow's head?
They say it started long, long ago in a far-off country. The country's queen was very rich and had a kind heart. One day she decided to arrange a huge banquet. All the animals were invited. The enormous tables were beautifully laden. Every table groaned under the delicacies, dishes full of meat, freshly baked bread, steaming vegetables and honey-sweet fruit.
The animals smacked their lips when they saw the delicious food. "The largest animal at each table should sit at the head," the queen said. "It is his or her job to dish out the food." Cow shared a table with Sheep, Goat, Dog, Goose and Fly. Since Cow was the biggest, she started dishing out the food. Each animal received a big chunk of home-baked bread with grape jam and cheese.
But because Fly was so small, Cow hardly noticed her. "Zoom! Zoom! Zee! What about me? I'd also like something to eat, you see?" Fly grumbled. But Cow pretended not to hear Fly. She tucked into the delicious bread. Poor Fly sat there deprived of everything, watching the other animals eat.
When they had finished the last crumb of bread, Cow started dishing out the meat and vegetables. Each animal received a large plate of food. But because Fly was so small, Cow once again hardly noticed her. "Zoom! Zoom! Zee! What about me? I'd also like something to eat, you see?" Fly grumbled louder than before. Cow rolled her eyes and was annoyed with Fly.
"Hey! Where are your manners?" Cow said. "A bug like you doesn't even belong at the queen's banquet. You can wait until the bigger animals have finished." The food was finished in two ticks. Poor Fly didn't receive the tiniest morsel. Cow started sharing the fruit. There were delicious water melon, juicy spanspek and red-cheeked apples.
All the animals received food, but Fly had to go without. "Zoom! Zoom! Zee! What about me? I'd also like something to eat, you see?" Fly complained. Cow laughed and took a bite from her apple. "Do you hear something?" she asked the other animals at the table. "I don't hear anything." In a jiffy all the food at the table had been finished. The animals were overstuffed. Everyone except Fly. Her tummy growled with hunger.
After the meal, it was time to dance and be merry. But Fly was angry. She decided to go home. The queen noticed Fly. "Why are you leaving, Fly?" the queen asked. "Don't you enjoy my banquet?" Fly curtsied before the queen. "I'm sorry, your Majesty," she said. "I'm sure the food was delicious. But I didn't have a tiny morsel of food." And she told the queen what had happened. The queen was very angry when she heard what Cow had done.
"From now on you and your friends may pester Cow every day," the queen said. "From morning till night you may buzz around her ears. It will teach her a lesson. She will never be able to ignore you again. And she'll see that even the tiniest insect is important to me."
And that is exactly what Fly has been doing until today. She and her friends buzz around Cow's ears from morning till night. And while they are doing it,  they sing: "Zoom! Zoom! Zee! Never ever again, can you ignore us. Say never!"
It is nearly break time at Siyafunda Primary School. The two spaza shop owners at the school are preparing lunch to sell to hungry children.
In Mr Motaung’s shop, the bread is cut and ready for making kotas. He carefully cuts out the soft middle of each quarter loaf. Then he puts polony and chips in the space inside. Motaung puts two spoonfuls of his wife’s homemade atchar in each kota. He likes to boast that his kotas have atchar inside and atchar on top!
In Mr Mkhize’s shop, the chips are nearly ready, but he is still cutting his bread for kotas. He is worried because things are not going well with his shop. “It started well,” thinks Mkhize. “But now I get fewer and fewer customers. At least I’m reducing some of my costs by cutting five kotas from a loaf.”
Jabu and Zodwa are buying lunch. Zodwa buys from Mr Mkhize. Jabu buys from Mr Motaung. He believes that Motaung’s kota has got more chips and atchar than Mkhize’s kota.
The queue at Mr Motaung’s shop is always longer. Zodwa waits for Jabu. Then the friends sit together in the shade to enjoy their kotas.
Zodwa notices something that makes her stare and frown. “What are you staring at?” asks Jabu. “Your kota! It looks bigger than mine,” says Zodwa.
They both look very closely at their kotas. Sure enough, Jabu’s is bigger. “Something is not right here,” says Zodwa. “I wonder if this is the reason Mr Mkhize’s shop is not busy anymore.” Jabu thinks for a while and then he replies, “Well, I heard that some kids saw Mkhize cutting his bread into five pieces for kotas!”
Nomsa overhears Jabu and Zodwa talking and she’s curious. She asks them what’s wrong with cutting the loaf into five pieces for kotas. Zodwa and Jabu reply together, “A kota is a quarter of a loaf!” Nomsa still looks confused, so Zodwa explains, “The loaf must be cut into four equal pieces. Otherwise, they are not quarters.”
Nomsa is cross because she also buys from Mr Mkhize. “So, he is stealing bread from us!” she says in a loud voice. Zodwa decides to go back to Mkhize’s shop to complain. She marches off, holding her kota up in the air. Nomsa hurries behind her. Jabu sighs and gets up to follow his friends.
Mr Mkhize is disappointed when he sees that the children aren’t new customers. “Oh, hello again kids,” he mutters, “how can I help you?” “Mr Mkhize, I asked you for a quarter and I paid you for a quarter. But this is not a quarter,” says Zodwa, pointing at her kota. “I want a quarter kota or my money back,” she adds firmly.
“Is it true Mr Mkhize? You’ve been cheating us!” cries Nomsa. A few children have followed them to the shop and are now listening to the fierce accusations. Mkhize waves his hands wildly. “What are you saying about me?” he protests. “I’m not like that! I want you to get out of my shop now!”
Then Zodwa says quietly, “We will tell everyone what you are doing. It will spread like wildfire throughout the school. You will have to close your shop. No one will come and buy from you!” Mr Mkhize looks at the three children standing in front of him. Then he looks at the growing crowd outside his shop.
“OK,” he says eventually, “I will give you your money back. “And also promise that you will cut each loaf into quarters for your kotas,” speaks up Jabu. Mr Mkhize promises that he will. Then he clears his throat and says loud enough for everyone to hear, “I also promise that I will add more atchar and more chips to my kotas.”
Mr Mkhize did indeed add extra chips and atchaar to his kotas. Soon more children were buying from him, and his shop started doing well. He was even able to hire someone to help him.
Now there is a healthy competition between Mr Mkhize and Mr Motaung, and everyone is happy.
Amara was walking through the park. The trees in the park were green and healthy. But, there was one tree that was brown and dry.
"This tree needs water," said Amara to herself. She watered the tree and it came to life with new growth. It was a magnificent green tree.
Then, the tree spoke! "You watered me and brought me back to life," said the tree. "I'm a magic tree, I shall grant you three wishes."
Amara made her first wish. "I wish for a red bicycle," she said cautiously. Abracadabra! A red bicycle appeared.
She made her second wish after thinking for a few moments. "I wish for a radio," said Amara. Abracadabra! A radio appeared.
Amara made her third wish. "I wish for pink crystal earrings," she said happily. Abracadabra! Pink crystal earrings appeared.
The magic tree said, "You have everything that you wanted." Amara smiled, "Yes I do, but those things were not for me." The magic tree looked confused.
"The bicycle is for my older brother. He outgrew his bicycle. The radio is for Dad. His radio broke. The earrings are for Mum. She loves fancy earrings," explained Amara. "And they will all share with me!" she added.
My mother planted.She planted a small garden.She planted a small garden of peas.
My father planted. He planted a small garden.  He planted a small garden of flowers.
My mother weeded in both gardens.
My father watered in both gardens.
My parents and I worked in the small gardens.My sister and I  harvested the flowers and peas.
The small garden of peas yielded sacks of peas. The small garden of flowers yielded sacks of flowers.
Hyena and Raven were once great friends, even though they were quite different in some ways. Raven could fly but Hyena was only able to walk.
One day Hyena, curious to know something about his friend, asked Raven, “What is this white thing which is always below your neck?”
Raven answered, “It is the fatty meat which I usually eat in the sky. I have been eating it for so long now it is stuck on my neck.”On hearing about meat, saliva started pouring out of Hyena’s mouth for he was greedy and he loved meat very much.Hyena really wanted to eat that meat. But how could he reach the meat in the sky if he had no wings to fly?“Please my friend,” he asked Raven, “lend me some feathers so that I can make myself some wings. I really want to be able to fly like you.”
Raven was not mean, so he gave him some feathers. Hyena sewed them together into wings. He fastened them to his body, and tried to take off into the sky. But he was far too heavy for the few feathers to carry him. So he had to think of another plan.
“Please my friend,” he asked Raven, “could I hold onto your tail as you fly up into the sky?”“All right,” said Raven. “I know how much you want to fly. Let’s do it tomorrow morning.”When day came, Hyena took hold of Raven’s tail and Raven flew up into the sky.
Raven flew and flew and flew until he was exhausted. But Hyena said, “Just a little further, my friend!” He could see the white and fatty meat just above them, and his mouth was watering.
When they reached the first piece of fatty meat, Hyena felt a jerk. One of Raven’s tail feathers came off in his hand! Then there was another jerk, and another.
Raven felt much lighter, and the ache in his tail was going. He sang: Raven’s feathers, unpluck yourselves. Raven’s feathers, unpluck yourselves.In response, Hyena sang the opposite: Raven’s feathers hold on, don’t unpluck yourselves. Raven’s feathers hold on, don’t unpluck yourselves.
Finally, the feathers could not hold Hyena anymore. He was in the middle of nowhere in the sky. He jumped onto the fatty meat thinking that as he ate, the fatty meat would hold him. But as he tried to hold and eat the ‘meat’, all he felt was moist cloud!
By now he was falling fast. “Help, help!” he shouted. But no one could hear him. Raven was lost in the clouds.
Hyena fell on the ground with a crash and lay silent for some minutes. He woke up howling in pain, with a broken leg and dark scars all over his body.
From that day to now, Hyena limps and he has many scars on his body. He has never been able to fly. And he and Raven are no longer friends.

Bunty loves to play with butterflies.
And with birds.
She loves to play with paper boats.
She also likes to make sand castles.
When Bunty goes back home, her mother asks her to clean up. She refuses.
"I hate soap!" she screams.
One night, she has a dream. The germs are all around her castle, and are attacking her.
Bunty is chased by the germs. She runs for her life and screams, "Help. Help!"
Suddenly, Soap King Bubbly appears. "Bunty, don't be afraid," he says. "Go attack the germs!" the Soap King orders his army of bubbles.
The army of bubbles chases the germs away.
These days, Bunty likes to use soap, and she brushes and scrubs herself clean.
One day,  Mr Sloth came to visit. He said:   I'm sleepy! I need a good branch for a bed!
I'm quite good at climbing. I know how to swing.   But sleeping's my favourite,  favourite thing.
This branch looks lovely! I think I'll sleep here.   And you? Don't you think that's a splendid idea?
Oh no,  Mr Sloth! A giraffe's eating there!   He might think you're lunch and start nibbling your hair!
This branch looks lovely! I think I'll sleep here.   And you? Don't you think that's a splendid idea?
Oh no,  Mr Sloth! There's a beehive right there!   You'll never get sleep with those bees everywhere!
This branch looks lovely! I think I'll sleep here.   And you? Don't you think that's a splendid idea?
Oh no,  Mr Sloth,  that's a snake over there!   Not a branch! Poor old snake. You gave him quite a scare.
This branch looks lovely! I think I'll sleep here.   And you? Don't you think that's a splendid idea?
Oh no,  Mr Sloth! There's a bird squawking there!   You'll never get sleep with that noise in the air!
Try climb one more branch,  Mr Sloth! They all said.   And that branch was just the right one for his bed.
The bird and the snake,  the giraffe and each bee   were happy to have Mr Sloth in their tree.
Long time ago,  there were two young men who lost their cows. They looked for the cows until it was late.
As it got dark,  they saw a light in a house. They agreed to go and ask for a place to sleep.
They went to the house and knocked. The door opened and they went in. The young men didn't see anyone. But they heard a voice greeting them.
The voice said,  "I am a louse. Open the metal pot and have food. Open the earthenware pot and drink amahewu."
Then the louse put on its skin and went out.
The young men ate,  drank,  and gave thanks. Then they left the house.
As they left,  they had a bad thought. They said,  "No,  it couldn't have happened that we had food from a louse."  Eventually they agreed to go back and crush the louse.
They went back to the house and crushed the louse. Suddenly the louse was gone,  and the house disappeared! They found themselves outside in the open.
The battle-weary king led his tired followers to settle on the sandy dunes of the Cape Flats.Majestic Table Mountain tried to protect them from the harsh weather as best she could.
The king's subjects complained bitterly about their new home.They could not bear the scorching summers nor the cold, wet winters. They could not bear the stinging sand and howling wind.
Fynbos and Rooibos were the king's trusted advisors. One day, they approached their king."Everyone suffers living under these difficult conditions. Can we move to a place where life will be easier?" they asked.
King Protea smiled at his advisors and spoke in a gentle voice. "You are loyal and I hear your concerns. However, this is our home. Together we can overcome any difficulty," said the king.
The sun beat down on the kingdom of the Cape Flats. The heat was relentless. A wildfire broke out. Furious winds fanned the raging fire. The flames crept across King Protea's kingdom, destroying everything.
When the fire finally died, it left behind a sad sight that stretched from Hoerikwaggo across the Cape Flats.The landscape lay bare for months. The seasons changed, as seasons do. Winter rains pelted the earth.
Unknown to all, something miraculous was happening under the soil. The seeds that survived the wildfire burst open, ready to grow.With incredible strength, the seedlings grew up towards the light and revealed colourful buds.
The landscape was once again decorated with regal proteas, resilient fynbos and healing rooibos.Plants in the Cape Floral Kingdom continue to thrive in the extreme conditions of the Cape Flats.
Lank, lank gelede was daar 'n leeu wat uit die bos wou kom en 'n mens as 'n vriend wou hè.
And so the lion and the man became friends.
They ate together and shared meat. The lion realised that the man was a meat lover. It began to fear that the man would kill it.
The lion feared that perhaps the man might spear it with his spears. The man feared that the lion might eat him at night when he slept.
One night the man dreamed that the lion was moving towards him slowly,  trying to eat him.
The man took up his spear,  shouting,  "If you want to eat me,  then I will spear you." The lion woke up and ran out,  "I said this man will one day kill me."
From that day,  the lion and the man were no longer friends. The lion will kill a human whenever it finds one. And humans will kill a lion if they can.
My home.
I stay in a house.There is no space for a mouse!
We have two bedrooms and a bathroom.
We have a lounge and a kitchen.
Mom says our home might be small, but we have love for all!

Long,  long ago,  when Zebra's skin was still white,  a terrible drought occurred. For months not a single drop of rain fell. The grass turned dull,  the trees became bare and the rivers dried up one by one. Springbok,  Warthog and Zebra had to walk very far each day in search of water.
One morning when Springbok arrived at the only watering hole,  he heard an angry voice say,  "Make way! Scoot! Or heads will roll! This is Baboon's watering hole!" Springbok's eyes widened. Baboon was sitting on a rock next to the watering hole,  grilling bananas over his open fire. "But I'm so thirsty,  my tongue feels like biltong," Springbok said. "Where will I find  water?"
After a while Warthog came trotting along. But as soon as he lowered his head to take a sip of water,  he heard an angry voice,  "Make way! Scoot! Or heads will roll! This is Baboon's watering hole!" Surprised,  Warthog turned around. He saw Baboon sitting on the rock next to the watering hole grilling his bananas.
"But I'm so thirsty,  it feels as if I've eaten dust," Warthog said. "Where will I find water?" Baboon growled. "Not my problem! Scoot! Or heads will roll! This is Baboon's watering hole." Warthog bristled at first,  but when he saw Baboon's long teeth,  he got scared. He turned around and trotted away,  tail in the air.
After a while Zebra turned up at the watering hole. Before he could take a sip of water he heard an angry voice. "Make way! Scoot! Or heads will roll! This is Baboon's watering hole!" Zebra snorted and looked up. He saw Baboon sitting on the rock grilling his bananas.
"But I'm so thirsty,  it feels as if my tongue slept outside my mouth last night," Zebra said. "Where will I find water?" "Not my problem! Scoot! Or heads will roll!This is Baboon's watering hole." Baboon showed his long teeth. Zebra wasn't scared. With clip-clopping hooves he stormed at baboon. He was so angry that he ran right through Baboon's burning fire. Sparks and smoke and bananas were flying.
Baboon tried to escape,  but it was too late. Zebra kicked him so hard that he flew through the air. "Ouch!" Baboon yelled. His butt landed on a sun baked rock. The rock was so hot that it burned off Baboon's hair. From that day Baboon has never had hair on his butt.
And Zebra's skin has never been lily-white again. Baboon's fire burned stripes onto his skin.
It was now safe for the animals to drink at the watering hole. And each morning,  as they came to drink water,  Springbok,  Warthog and Zebra sang,  "Come wet your throat here while you stroll,  this is everybody's watering hole!"
Lizzy lived next to a busy road. She would often sit outside and watch the activities of the street. Full taxis carried people to work. Children passed on their way to school, and runners jogged past in the evenings.
One day, Lizzy saw two girls on the other side of the road. They wanted to cross and were holding hands for safety. Mamma always told Lizzy, "Before you cross any road, look left, look right, look left again. Check it's safe to go."
Lizzy's eyes got even bigger and her jaw dropped.  She darted into the house.  "Mamma! Mamma! A girl has been bumped by a car!  She is lying outside of our yard and she is not moving!" cried Lizzy.
The worried paramedics placed Mosa carefully on a stretcher, and took her to hospital. After Mosa's accident, the local schools introduced road safety lessons for parents and children.The community petitioned for a pedestrian crossing, so that no more children would be hurt.
Long time ago, there were two young men who lost their cows. They looked for the cows until it was late.
As it got dark, they saw a light in a house. They agreed to go and ask for a place to sleep.

The voice said, "I am a louse*. Open the metal pot and have food. Open the earthenware pot and drink amahewu**."* A small parasitic insect** A Southern African drink
Then the louse put on its skin and went out.
The young men ate, drank, and gave thanks. Then they left the house.
As they left, they had a bad thought. They said, "No, it couldn't have happened that we had food from a louse." Eventually they agreed to go back and crush the louse.
They went back to the house and crushed the louse. Suddenly the louse was gone, and the house disappeared! They found themselves outside in the open.
"Oh, no!"
"Lulu, it is time to go," calls Ma.
Where is Lulu?Is she under the sofa?
Is she behind the curtain?
Where is Lulu?Is she next to the stove?
Is she in the cupboard?
"Lulu, it is time to go! Where are you?" calls Ma.
"There you are!" says Ma."I do not want to gooo!"
"We have to go," says Ma."But I really like this one!"
"I really like this one!"
"And this one!"
"And this one!""And that one!"
"See, you return books and borrow more," says Ma."YAY!"
Where is Lulu now?
Wayan lived in a small village by the sea.The people there believed that when you died, you returned to the sea. The sea is a special place where the ancestors live.
Wayan learned to fish just as everything was changing for the fishermen. There were fewer fish, and they were always small. Sometimes, the boats came back empty, even though they had been at sea all day.
One day, while Wayan was fishing, a storm blew over. He was swept into the waves. A turtle saved him. "I am Bintang. I will help you, climb onto my back," said the turtle."Maybe you can help me. My grandfather is very sick and no one knows what to do."
Finally, the thing came out. It was a plastic straw! The straw had stuck down grandfather's throat. Grandfather began to breathe more easily. Bintang said to Wayan, "I will take you to the others."They went to Turtle Hospital. "What happened to these turtles?" asked Wayan.
Wayan promised that he would do his best to help. Bintang carried him back to the shore, and then swam away. Wayan realised that the villagers needed to clean up the sea and beaches. He ran to the elders to tell them about the turtles.
People agreed to a ban on plastic straws, plastic bottles and plastic bags. They agreed to throw their trash into trash bins only, and to stop burning and burying plastic. They decided to stop fishing until the sea was clean.
Eventually, the sea and beaches returned to the way they were before Wayan was born.The water was clean and full of life. People were no longer sick from eating sick fish.Wayan learned that when the sea is polluted, we all suffer. When the sea is healthy, we can all be happy.
One special Friday Yusuf ’s father gets dressed before a flicker of light brightens the sky. He pulls on his heavy weather-proof jacket and the green woollen cap that covers his ears. He waves his boy goodbye. Yusuf ’s eyes brighten when Papa says, “Today is the day I will catch a fish and bring a gift home for you.”
A fish and a gift? Oh, what will it be? Papa cycles down to Muizenberg Beach. Squeak squeak go the wheels all the way to Surfer’s Corner.Gulls circle the sky. “Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” they cry. “What will you bring back for Yusuf?”Papa rings his bell. “Wait and see what it will be!”
The fishermen watch the sun rise. They check their nets. They check their oars. They listen to the wind. They drag their boats down to the water. Yusuf ’s grandfather, Oupa Salie was a treknet fisherman. Before him his father, Oupagrootjie Ridwaan, knew the sea too.
The boat rides into the waves. Papa’s arms stretch to the oar. His leg braces against the side. His neck strains, his back muscles ripple.Papa sings as he works: “Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don’t you stop.”
All day long Yusuf looks at the sky. It is bright and clear and windless. A fish and a gift! What will Papa bring home from the sea? Sometimes he brings a beautiful shell. Sometimes he brings a jewel green bottle rinsed by the waves.
Some days Yusuf ’s father brings a story. Like the time they found sea turtles on the sand, hundreds washed up in a storm.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cried the gulls. “What will you do to help the turtles?”Papa said, “We saved those turtles, I tell you straight. We sent them back to the ocean, every last one.”
Always Papa brings a song. He sings the song while he pulls the oars. He sings the song while he pulls the nets. He sings the song as he winds the ropes. He sings the song as he cycles home. “Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don’t you stop.”
Ouma Safiya wants a nice fat yellowtail for her supper. Mother wants a new dress.“Don’t be silly,” says Ouma. “You’ll be lucky if they catch even a tiny crab. More likely it will be fish tail Friday. There’s not so many fish left in the sea.”Yusuf holds Ouma’s hand. They cross the road at the bathing cabins.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cry the gulls perched on the bright rooftops. “What is for supper?”
Last year the fishermen fought with the surfers. Angry fists and shouting words.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cried the gulls.“There’s enough sea for everybody,” said Yusuf ’s father. He showed them the fishing licence that had been Oupa Salie’s. “Waves for all. Water for free.”
Ouma Safiya watches through her binoculars, her fingers curled in curiosity. The shark siren sounds. Swimmers run back to the sand and grab their towels. Surfers rush to the shore, carrying their boards under their arms. Under the showers they strip off their wetsuits.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cry the gulls. “What will Yusuf ’s father bring from the ocean?”
Yusuf’s father and uncle and cousins heave and pull. A little shark has been caught. It twists and thrashes in the waves. Yusuf’s father untangles the nets, singing to the shark: “Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don’t you stop.”When the shark at last is free it streaks back into the waves, leaving only one fat yellowtail in the net. Ouma Safiya will be pleased.
The men pull the boat in and coil up the cables. A hard white triangle catches Papa’s finger.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cry the gulls. “What did you bring back for Yusuf?”As the sun goes down, Papa answers the gulls. “A lucky shark tooth for my boy.”At home Yusuf holds his gift up to the stars.

Once upon a time, Eagle and Hen were best friends. The two of them were together and chatted from morning till dusk. Eagle's chickens couldn't wait to visit Hen's chickens and play with them.
One day Hen approached Eagle. "My friend," she said. "I have to ask you a big favour. Rooster's pyjama pants are torn. He is really grumpy about it. They are his favourite pants. I want to mend the pants, but I don't have a needle. May I borrow your needle?" Eagle nodded. "Of course, dear friend," she said. "But please take good care of it. It is an heirloom needle. My grandmother gave it to me." "Of course, my friend," Hen said. She took the shining needle. "I'll return it tomorrow."
Hen went away to mend her husband's pants. The next morning, as usual, Hen was on her way to Eagle. But oh, goodness – the needle was gone! Hen anxiously called her little chicks together. "Has anyone seen Eagle's needle?" she asked. "No, Mommy," the chickens cheeped. "Help me look for it," Hen said.
Hen and her chickens looked everywhere. In every bush. Behind every lump of grass. Inside all their nests. But Eagle's needle was gone.
"And where is the needle you borrowed from me?" Eagle asked. Hen swallowed. "Oh, Eagle I am so sorry. I lost your needle." "Lost it?" Eagle was angry. "Don't worry," Hen said quickly. "My chickens and I will find it. It must be here somewhere."
Look carefully when you see Hen and her chickens again. Up until this day they are still scratching around in the dust, looking for Eagle's needle. And when Hen notices an eagle flying in the air, she anxiously clucks: "Quick, little chicks. Hide beneath my wings. If Eagle sees you, she will catch you. She is still annoyed about her grandmother's needle."
My heart feels alot of things.
I feel happy whenmy granny tells us stories in the evening.
I feel silly whenI play with my friend.
I feel bad whenmy dad says he does not have money.
I feel loved whenmy mom gives me a hug.

Basetsana Makgalemele was born in Soweto. She was her parents' third daughter. They named her Basetsana, which means "girls." In Tswana culture, calling your daughter that means your next child will be a boy. This actually happened. Her parents' next child was a boy. Her parents,  big sisters and younger brother all called her Bassie for short.
When she was a child,  Bassie was very shy. She liked to sing and dance in her room on her own. One day at school netball practice,  the coach told two girls to pick teams. Bassie stood on the edge of the field hoping someone would say,  "Come play with us!" But nobody wanted her on their team. Little did they know,  Bassie would become one of the most popular girls in the country.
On weekends, Bassie and her brother and sisters helped their teacher mom and bus driver dad to pay the bills. They made sandwiches to sell at local soccer matches. They tried to sell everything as fast as they could so they had time to play with the other children when the game was over.
By the time Bassie turned 16,  she was a beautiful young woman. She was so beautiful that she won two beauty competitions in one year: Miss Soweto and Miss Black South Africa.   But Bassie was not only beautiful on the outside. She was also beautiful on the inside. She cared about the community where she grew up.
Bassie was very smart. She worked hard at school, especially on her favourite subject: science. Her hard work was rewarded when she was the top science student at her school in matric. That's not all,  she was also Head Girl. The shy little girl was now one of the most popular girls in school.
Bassie's father always encouraged his children to read. He gave her a book called The Power of Positive Thinking. From that book, she learnt that being optimistic is the key to making your dreams a reality. She dreamt of winning the Miss South Africa beauty competition. In 1994, that dream come true! She was also crowned First Princess in the Miss World competition.
Bassie's mother was her role model. Bassie described her mom as a "fierce,  hardworking Xhosa woman who did not suffer fools." She was a teacher and Bassie had plans to follow in her footsteps,  but things don't always go as planned! After winning Miss South Africa,  she became a TV presenter. She worked hard and her career in TV led to her opening her own television production company. Basetsana was now also a successful business woman.
Bassie's motto is: "To whom much is given,  much is expected." She believes that you are given a gift so that you can give to others. Bassie does this by volunteering,  giving of her time and money and even creating jobs. She is involved with projects and charities to help people in her community. One that is very close to her heart is the Nelson Mandela Institute.
Bassie had a very close relationship with Nelson Mandela. When she was crowned Miss South Africa,  Madiba wrote her a letter of congratulations. In the letter,  he called her "our Queen." They shared a passion for children and education and the belief that an educated nation can help fight poverty.
Basetsana married Romeo Kumalo and became known as Basetsana Kumalo. Together they established the Romeo & Basetsana Kumalo Family Foundation. The foundation looks after orphans.
Bassie has had to learn to balance her busy work and family life. She has her own company called Basetsana Women Investment Holdings. She and Romeo have three children,  two boys and a girl. Bassie sees her role as mother to her children as her "highest calling and greatest privilege."
Bassie says the secret to her success is "courage,  determination,  passion and staying committed to the course." Despite all her success,  she remains humble while trying to make the world a better place. Being beautiful on the outside is not what makes you a beautiful person. It's a heart filled with love and generosity. And that's why Basetsana is our beautiful Queen.
There was only one bus in Ebei's village. It was big and blue. It was very noisy.
“Tomorrow we will go to town,” said Ebei's mother. “We will buy your school uniform.”
Ebei was very excited. They would travel in the big blue bus. He could not sleep that night.
When his mother came to wake him, Ebei was already dressed.
Ebei and his mother walked to the bus stop. They waited for the big blue bus. But the bus did not come.
Other people arrived at the bus stop. They complained because the bus was late. “Where is the bus?” they asked.
Ebei was worried. “We will not be able to go to town,” he thought. “I will not be able to get my uniform.”
Some people gave up and went home. Ebei cried. He did not want to go. “We will wait a bit longer,” said his mother.
Suddenly, they heard a noise. They saw dust in the air. The bus was coming!
But this bus was not blue. It was not big. It was red and small. The people did not want to get in this bus.
“Get in! Get in!” shouted the driver. “We are very late today,” he called.
Ebei and his mother got in first. Soon everyone else got in the small red bus.
Ebei looked out the window. He saw more people at the bus stop.
Even more people were running to catch the bus. But they were too late. The red bus was full. It left for town.
“Where is the big blue bus?” asked Ebei's mother. “It broke down,” replied the driver. “We are fixing it. It will come tomorrow.”
Ebei did not care about the colour of the bus. He did not care about the size. This bus was going to town!

One day, Nakehi and his wife went to visit Nipapariya and his wife.
When the couple arrived,  Nipapariya and his wife graciously welcomed them.
They killed a chicken and cooked it.
And they all ate together.
The next week, Nipapariya and his wife went to visit Nakehi and his wife.
When they arrived, Nakehi was not at home.
He had gone out to set a trap to catch a francolin.
When Nakehi returned, he saw his friends. He was so happy.
He went to see what his wife was cooking.
She was cooking beans.
He kicked over the beans and stormed out of the house.
He told his friends about a trap that he had set near a nest of francolin eggs.
As they were talking, Nakehi heard the sound of a francolin calling. The call told him something.
The bird was caught in the trap!
Nakehi jumped up, put his knife in his belt, and ran off to catch the francolin.
Trembling with excitement, he grabbed the francolin in one hand.
With his other hand he gathered up the eggs.
Nakehi headed home, full of pride.
But as he walked, his knife was cutting away at his belt.
Proudly Nakehi walked up to his house.
At that moment, his belt snapped and his loincloth fell to his ankles.
He tried to grab the cloth but let go of the bird.
The francolin flew away. The eggs lay broken on the ground.
Nipapariya and his wife laughed and laughed.
Then they all ate what was left of the beans.

﻿A fawn was zooming in a race through the forest.
He ran past the rabbit with ease.
He even flew past the big-big elephant.
He jumped over the stream feeling refreshed by the cold water.
He ran past the crumbling wall.
In excitement, he didn't pay attention to where he was running and missed the large boulder. He stumbled and fell.
﻿He got hurt very badly in his leg and couldn't get up.
The monkey massaged his leg. Tears flowed from the fawn's eyes. He couldn't bear the pain.
Brother Bear picked him up and called his mother.
His mother came. She said, “Look, we’ll beat up this bad boulder!”
The fawn said, “Oh, don’t do that or he will also get hurt and start crying.” His mother laughed. So did he.
Once upon a time, Lion was the strongest and most feared of all the animals. He would catch other animals and eat them. But one morning while he was looking for his breakfast, he got caught in a hunter's trap.
Lion gave his loudest roar. He pulled and pulled to free himself from the trap. The trap got tighter and tighter around his leg every time he pulled. Lion grew tired and he felt more pain in his leg. Finally, he gave up.
Days went past as Lion lay baking in the sun. He was hungry and thirsty and there was nobody to save him. He became weaker and weaker. "I am going to die of hunger and thirst in this trap," he thought to himself.
One morning, Lion heard a sound coming from the nearby bushes. He listened and looked closer. He saw Warthog walking with his family, talking and laughing. The warthogs were going to the river to drink water and play in the mud before the sun got too hot.
"Warthog! Please help me! Warthog!" cried Lion. "Please set me free from this trap," he pleaded. "Never," said Warthog. "You are a cruel animal. You will eat me and my family for breakfast if I set you free." Lion replied, "I promise I would never do such a bad thing. We will be friends if you can set me free."
Warthog felt sorry for Lion. "I do not like seeing you in such pain, thirsty and dying from hunger," he said. So he pulled at the trap with his long strong tusks and released Lion. Warthog saved his new friend.
"Thank you for saving my life," said Lion. "I must go to my family now,  good bye." Warthog replied, "Go well my friend." He was happy that Lion was his friend. "My family will never have to run from Lion again," he thought.
Lion walked away limping and weak. He was also very hungry. Then he saw Warthog's children playing in the mud. "Today is my lucky day," said Lion with his mouth watering.
"Warthog, my new friend," called Lion. "I have been caught in the trap for days without food. I am too weak to hunt. Please would you give one of your children to me for breakfast?" Warthog was shocked. "I saved you from the trap and now you want to eat my children?"
"I am very sorry my friend," said Lion, "but I am starving. I might be weak right now,  but I am still stronger than you." Lion opened his mouth and showed his strong teeth. "If you do not give me one of your children, I will take one for myself," he roared.
Warthog knew that he did not have the speed or the strength of Lion. He would never be able to protect his children in a fight. "All right," agreed Warthog. "I will give you one of my children. But first I want you to show me how you were caught in the trap. In case I have to save another lion from such a trap."
Lion imagined the wonderful taste of young warthog in his mouth. He could hardly wait. He went back to the trap and put his foot inside, to show his friend how he was trapped.
"Ouch!" Lion roared. Warthog had closed the trap on Lion's foot. "Aha! I got you," said Warthog. "You will stay in that trap hungry and thirsty again. See if your strong teeth and sharp claws can help you now."
"Run! Run! Run away!" Warthog's wife shouted to the children at the top of her voice. "Raise your tails when you are running so that your father can see you," she called. The babies ran as fast as they could through the bushes.
"Warthog please help me!" begged Lion again. He was in pain from the trap. "I will do anything for you if you save me," he cried. "No way, liar! I will never believe you again," shouted Warthog. "I will also warn other animals not to save you because you are very sly."
Warthog saw his children running in a row with their mother. Their tails were lifted up for him to see them. He rushed to his family and they all escaped safely. To this day, warthogs always run with their tails lifted up to see that everyone is safe.

Should I just go back to sleep? But I am not sleepy any more.
Then someone turns on the light. Ma is standing at the door.

Simamkele loves dolls. Mama buys him lots. They keep his loneliness away. Sima's favourite doll is Siza. Sima wants to be a nurse when he grows up.
He loves to put on Mama's skirt, and twirl. Like magic, he suddenly becomes Sima the nurse.He plays hospital-hospital and makes sickly Siza and all his dolls better.
Wherever Sima is, Siza is there too.
But Sima's friends do not like Siza. One day, they took him away and stuck his head in the toilet.
When Papa came home, Sima was nursing Siza. "What are you doing?" asked Papa. "I'm being a nurse," said Sima. "Will you play with me?" "Yes. But we will go to the park and play soccer," said Papa.
His friends saw Sima and Papa playing soccer. They joined in. Sima and Papa often play soccer now. But they still haven't played with dolls.
One day, Sima was playing hospital-hospital with his dolls. He heard Mama shout. "Sima! Run! Papa is waiting to play with you at the park."
"Why on earth are you wearing a dress?" said Papa in an angry voice. Just then a ball flew out of nowhere and.
Knocked Papa down. Everyone panicked. Except Sima. He knelt and tied his blanket around Papa's bleeding head. "Call an ambulance!" he shouted.
"He needs stiches in his head. You did just the right thing," said the nurse. Sima was proud.
"You're a hero. You'll make a great doctor one day." "But I want to be a nurse, just like you," said Sima.
"Thank you, Nurse Sima," said Papa. Now Sima and Papa play hospital-hospital and soccer – and his friends do too.
Once upon a time, there was a farmer and his wife who had one child. Their child was a boy called Kisirusiru, which means, one who behaves foolishly.
One day, as Kisirusiru took the goats out, a goat's horn tore his shirt. His mother sent him to the shop to buy a needle so that she could mend his shirt. Kisirusiru bought the needle and put it in the pocket of his shirt.
As he was going home, he saw boys playing football and he joined them. The needle fell out of his pocket and was lost. When he reached home he told his mother what had happened. "My child," said his mother, "next time put the needle in a piece of paper." "Yes mother, I understand," replied Kisirusiru.
The next day, the boy picked up a pot to go and fetch water. After he had filled the pot he remembered what his mother said. So he wrapped the pot in a piece of paper to carry it home. But on the way, the paper got torn. The pot fell and broke into pieces, spilling all the water.
The goat kicked and scratched Kisirusiru's head. Soon blood was trickling down his face. "When will you stop your stupidity?" shouted his father. "Goats are tied and pulled with ropes! Behave properly or you'll have to leave my house."
The next day, the man sent his son to buy meat at the market. Remembering what his father said, Kisirusiru tied a rope around the meat. He pulled it home. He ran very fast so he did not to keep his father waiting. Imagine how the meat looked when it reached home!
His father was so angry that he told Kisirusiru to pack his things and leave. When his mother heard this, she decided to leave with her son. They took the kitchen door with them, so that they would have something to start building a new house.
They had walked for quite a while but could not find anywhere to build their new house. When it became dark, they decided to climb up a tree to sleep. They pulled up the door and their belongings with them.
They had just climbed the tree when they heard noises from below. They saw three men with sacks. They looked dangerous. Kisirusiru and his mother were so scared that they let go of their belongings. The door crashed to the ground. The men got such a fright that they ran away, leaving the sacks behind.
Kisirusiru and his mother climbed down the tree. They opened the men's sacks. Inside they found money, clothes, blankets, and other things they needed to set up house. They soon found a place to build themselves a new house. They lived happily ever after.
My mother planted.She planted a small garden.She planted a small garden of peas.
My father planted. He planted a small garden.  He planted a small garden of flowers.
My mother weeded in both gardens.
My father watered in both gardens.
My parents and I worked in the small gardens.My sister and I  harvested the flowers and peas.
The small garden of peas yielded sacks of peas. The small garden of flowers yielded sacks of flowers.
There are many ways to travel. Which shall I choose?
Should I use a plane?
Planes fly very high. I am afraid of flying!
Perhaps I should use a helicopter?
But helicopters and planes are the same!
Should I perhaps use a train?
But the train station is very far.
Or,  perhaps,  I should use a bus?
Our village has only one bus!
Perhaps I shall use a lorry to travel.
But lorries are used for carrying heavy luggage.
Should I use a bicycle to travel?
But will my father give me his bicycle?
Perhaps I will try to use a boat?
But I do not trust boats very much!
Aah! I know what I shall use! I shall use a tractor to travel.

'Wov! What a lovely raincoat!' Mannu danced happily holding the shining red raincoat that his parents had bought for him.'Mamma, may I wear the raincoat now?' Manu asked his mother.Mamma said, 'No, my child. You can wear it when it rains. It should start raining soon. But as of now I don't see any signs of the rain.'
But, Monday was a bright sunny day, full of golden sunshine.Mannu looked out of the window every now and then and asked his mother,'Mamma, will it rain today?'Mamma  peeped out of the window and said, ' I don't think it will rain today. You cannot wear the raincoat today. People will laugh at you, if you do.'
On Tuesday also Mannu kept looking at the sky. And the raincoat was kept right next to him, ready to be used. But the sky was a nice blue and as bright as it was on Monday.Mannu was disappointed,'Mamma, when will I be able to use the raincoat?''There is just a single cloud in the sky today, and that too a white one. I don't think you will get a chance to wear the raincoat today.'Mamma said.
Wednesday again was a very hot sunny day.Mannu was getting worried, 'Mamma, why is it not raining yet?'He tried to put the raincoat on at home. But had to immediately take it off because he felt too hot in it.Mamma, in her eagerness to comfort him said, 'I think it will rain soon, probably by afternoon.'
On Thursday, there was the school picnic. Mannu was eager to show off the raincoat to his school buddies.'Mamma, shall I carry the raincoat to the picnic. What if it rains there?' Mannu asked.'Don't, my pet. It will not rain today. See those white clouds? And they are also so far away.' Mamma tried to comfort him.
And... at last  on Friday, the sky looked quite dark with black clouds. Mannu kept the raincoat ready at hand.'Mamma, it will rain today, right mamma?' Mannu asked excitedly. The peacock also seemed to think so and started dancing. The tortoise came out of it's hiding and looked up at the sky hoping perhaps to feel cooler after the hot summer.'I think so. Today the sky is full of black clouds.' Mamma smiled at Mannu's excitement and was happy for him.
On the Saturday morning there was a loud thunder.  And also lightening.'Mamma, it that not lightening? Now it will surely rain, right Mamma?' asked Manu.He ran out on the lawns and saw that a frog and a tortoise also had come out of their hiding.
And.. tip...tap...tip...tap... came down the raindrops!Mannu, loved the rains...raincoat or no raincoat.'Oh, it is raining; it is raining.' Thus shouting  Mannu ran out of the house and started  jumping and dancing in the rain. And he had the company of the frog who also seemed to be  waiting for the rains.
'Wait Mannu, wait.' Mamma ran after him with his raincoat in her hand. 'You forgot your raincoat!'But Mannu was very happy getting drenched in rains. The raincoat which he was holding close to himself all this time was all forgotten.

Chicken and Millipede were very close friends. In some ways they were very similar; they both loved sport and were very competitive. But in other ways they were very different. Millipede loved to joke around and make people laugh. She was able to do many things at once, juggling tasks with her many legs. Chicken was more serious. She was good at taking others under her wing and making them feel safe and cared for. But she also had a terrible temper!
One day they decided to play a friendly game of soccer. Chicken was a fast runner and an excellent dribbler. She also had a powerful kick and could score goals from far away. But Millipede had something Chicken could never compete with - hundreds of legs! Millipede ran circles around poor Chicken, scoring goal after goal. Chicken got angrier and angrier. Watch out, Millipede!
"Let's have a penalty shoot-out," said Chicken, hoping that this would prevent Millipede from using her legs to dribble around her."Sure thing!" said Millipede confidently.First Millipede was goal keeper. Chicken scored only one goal. Then it was Chicken's turn to defend the goal.
Millipede kicked the ball and scored. Millipede juggled the ball and scored. Millipede headed the ball and scored. Millipede tapped the ball and scored.Chicken grew angrier by the minute. "This is unfair," she thought, "Millipede should only be able to use two of her legs. She is cheating!"While Chicken was busy thinking her angry thoughts, Millipede slyly kicked the ball around her and through the goalposts. Millipede scored five goals!
Chicken was furious that she had lost."I want a rematch," she demanded, "and this time you can only use two of your legs!"Millipede started laughing because her friend was making such a fuss. "What a sore loser you are!" she said, "Why didn't you use your wings to flap the ball into the goal, or your feathers to blow it over my head? You lost fair and square, my friend!"
"You see," said Millipede, "soccer is really all about strategy. You need to use your brain and have a plan.""Are you telling me I don't have any brains?" shrieked Chicken. "How dare you!"But before Millipede could answer, Chicken opened up her beak and swallowed her.
As Chicken was walking home, she met Mother Millipede. Usually Chicken loved to see her friend's mother. Mother Millipede told wonderful stories and baked the most delicious leaf cakes. But today Chicken marched right on, hoping Mother Millipede would not recognize her."Hello dear," Mother Millipede called, “Have you seen my child?” Chicken didn't say anything. Mother Millipede was worried. "Chicken is acting very strangely!" she thought.
Then Mother Millipede heard a tiny voice. “Help me, Mom!” cried the voice. Mother Millipede looked  around and listened carefully. "Where is that voice coming from?" she asked. "Have you got someone inside your stomach, Chicken?"Chicken looked around sheepishly. She didn't know what to do."Who have you eaten?" asked Mother Millipede. "Don't tell me you've eaten my precious baby!"
Mother Millipede shouted, “Use your special power my child!”Millipedes can make a badsmell and a terrible taste. Chicken began to feel ill."I don't feel so well," she moaned. "I need to go home and lie in my bed."
Chicken burped. Then she swallowed and spat. Then she sneezed and coughed.  Millipede tasted disgusting!Meanwhile, Mother Millipede stood beside her, cheering. "Well done, my darling!" she shouted, "Keep on working that special magic! You'll be out in no time."
Chicken coughed and coughed until Millipede came out. "Hooray!" shouted Millipede, "I'm free! I escaped!"Mother Millipede was relieved to see her child alive and well. "Come quickly," she whispered, and her and Millipede crawled quickly away. They climbed and climbed until they reached the top of a tall tree where they could hide.
From that time on, all chickens and millipedes have been enemies.
One harsh winter, many people in the land were sick. Ma Monikazi’s cheeks burned. Sweat dripped from her body. She wanted to hold the icy grass to her face to cool down. Under her blanket she held her belly and sang to the baby inside her: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”Her stomach growled when the baby’s powerful kicks woke her at night. She ate the leftover meat in the cooking pot, hungry for life.
One bright night the moon was bigger, fatter and pinker than ever. Her breath came fast. The baby was ready. The aunties in the birthing room rubbed her back and warmed the water. When Monikazi held her beautiful daughter in her arms, she knew she was a special girl, a fighter.What a blessing! Her name is Nontsikelelo. She will be the mother of all blessings.
Nontsikelelo was beautiful and strong with crinkling black button eyes. She loved her older brother, Mcengi. He made her laugh and so the laughter spread. She loved to eat meat before she had teeth. Her favourite aunt always kept a little portion on the side of her plate for Ntsiki. Mcengi chased the chickens that scratched in the garden where Ma Monikazi grew spinach and squash to feed her family. Ntsiki ran after him as her legs grew strong.Ma Monikazi had another baby boy, Velaphi, and another, Qudalele. Finally another sister, Nomyaleko. Little Ntsiki folded napkins and washed the baby clothes. She swept the house and fed the fire. She picked up her baby brother when he cried and tickled him till he laughed.She taught them to sing: “Be strong, little one. Winter is gone. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”
Qingqiwe, her grandfather, raised horses. His favourite was Shishi, a glossy black mare. As soon as Ntsiki was old enough, he hoisted her on to the saddle in front of him. His strong arms reached around her. He laced the reins through her fingers.He taught her to talk softly to Shishi, to groom her with a hard bristled brush. When she stroked its glossy coat, Albertina whispered, “You are the most beautiful creature. Thank you for letting me ride on your back.”Her father, Bonilizwe, came home from the mines at Christmas. Ntsiki pulled herself up onto Shishi’s broad back. She rode out to meet him at the bus stop. Ntsiki sat tall and straight. Her knees held firm. She handled the reins with gentle fingers.How proud Bonilizwe was of his daughter. The biggest smile Ntsiki had ever seen covered her father’s face.
On her sixth birthday she went to school. “You must choose an English name,” said the Presbyterian teacher, but Ntsiki liked her own name. “Why do I need a new name?” she asked. The teacher scowled and read the names aloud: “Adah, Agnes, Albertina, Anna.” What did they mean? Ntsiki liked the long name best. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had rhythm. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had bounce. Albertina was a name you didn’t mess with.When her cousin married a handsome man from a nearby town, Albertina was chosen as an umkhapi. The maid of honour! Weeks before the wedding, she stitched her isikhakha, the short traditional skirt, and threaded bright beads onto her amatikiti. Her mother gave her the white flag and said, “You have a big job, my blessing.”At the bend in the road Albertina waved the flag, then turned Shishi back, leading everybody from miles around to the ceremony. People would gossip if she made a mistake, but the guests lined the road. They ululated and sang. They threw down flowers for the horse and the girl.
Her mother was often sick and needed Albertina to look after the home. In her last year of primary school, Albertina was the oldest pupil in the school. She was chosen to be the head girl and wore her badge with pride.Her best friend, Betty, told her about a competition, saying, “You must apply, my clever friend.” “What is the prize?” asked Albertina, growing curious.“A scholarship to high school!” said Betty. “You must apply. You’ll win it, for sure.”
Albertina studied until the candle burned down. She practised sums. She practised spelling. She sharpened her pencils and gave her shoes an extra shine. Next morning she passed Shishi in her paddock. The horse whinnied and stamped the ground.The test began. Albertina’s fingers shook. The sums were tricky. Her mouth went dry. Her hand cramped on her pencil but she continued. “Well done, Albertina!” said her teacher at the end. The important official arrived and called the top two students to the stage. “Well done to Albertina for full marks,” he said, “but you are too old. The scholarship goes to…”Albertina tried not to cry. “That’s unfair,” shouted Betty, hopping with fury. “That wasn’t in the rules!” How would Albertina go to high school now? She dragged her feet all the way home.The teacher wrote to the newspaper about the unfair decision. Brother Joe at the Catholic Mission station read the story over his breakfast. He cracked his boiled egg with an extra flourish. He pushed the newspaper across the table to Father Bernard. He didn’t like the story one bit either.
Soon enough there was a scholarship for Albertina. Mariazell near Matatiele was a long way from Xolobe, but the whole village erupted. Their home girl was off to high school. She would make them proud. They threw a party like no other. The women brewed the sorghum beer and lit the fires. They slaughtered chickens and stirred up pots of meat. Albertina smiled till her face ached.She packed her brown suitcase and polished her shoes again. Before setting off on the bus to Matatiele, she said goodbye to Shishi. Albertina brushed her coat and stroked her wiry mane. She whispered all her questions into the horse’s silky ear: What if I get lost? Will I make new friends? Will I still be clever so far from home? Shishi whinnied and stamped the ground.
School days started well before sunrise. The girls washed quickly in the cold water and swept the dormitories before Mass. The milky porridge was never quite enough; the stew not as tasty as Aunty’s back home. But Albertina studied hard. She played netball on sunny afternoons.In her school holidays Albertina worked at the mission station. She rubbed and scrubbed against the zinc washboard. She boiled sheets in copper tubs, then wound them through the wringer. She hoed and tilled the school garden but missed her family. Who was telling her brothers and sisters funny stories? Who wiped their eyes when they cried? Who tickled them until they laughed?Albertina loved the nuns who taught her. Could she become a holy sister? “But nuns earn no salary,” said Father Bernard. “Perhaps you should become a nurse? You’ll be paid while you study.”
Albertina took a train to Johannesburg. She bought a smart white uniform, new navy shoes and a shiny red fountain pen. Sick people came all day to the hospital. She cleaned their wounds with careful fingers. She held the old people gently. When the babies cried, she sang: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!Some nights Albertina worked till dawn. She looked out the window and thought of her family. Were the children hungry? Did they go to school? Who was riding Shishi? She remembered the dark green spinach. She missed the scent of the earth. There was no vegetable garden here. There was nowhere for a horse.Albertina never went to parties. She saved every shilling. On her days off she learned to play tennis. Whoosh! Plop! She whacked the ball across the net. Always, she wished for a little more money to send home.
Walter Sisulu was a brave and clever man who dreamed of freedom for South Africa. His big smile captured Albertina’s eye. They walked together down the city streets. Her delicate hand rested on his arm. Walter wanted Albertina to be the mother of his children.Bright ribbons decorated the Bantu Men’s Social Centre on their wedding day. Albertina’s long-sleeved dress had a swirling train of lace. Many friends blessed their special day. Albertina planted flowers in her little garden. Within a year, Max was born. Albertina had become a mother. One day people would call her the mother of the nation.Max had his mother’s black button eyes and his father’s round chin. He was the hope for their future. Albertina wanted to fight for a new South Africa, so that Max could be free. When he cried, she sang: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”
Police came in the middle of the night, banging on the door. Albertina scolded the men who messed up her house. “How rude you are!” she said, “trampling mud inside my home.”In the morning Albertina’s favourite flowers lay crushed beneath their footprints. She remembered chasing the chickens from her vegetable garden back in Xolobe and set about replanting her garden. The earth, she knew, would recover.She would support her husband who kept many secrets and hid from the police.
She joined the women and worked to organise a march to Pretoria. The women refused to carry a pass. They sang, “Wathint’ abafazi; wathint’ imbokodo! You strike a woman; you strike a rock!”Many hard years followed after Walter’s arrest. He was jailed on Robben Island for 26 years. Albertina, also, was sent to jail many times. Often she was scared. Often she was lonely.But even on the darkest nights, she could see a sliver of moon through the window in her cell. She sang the song that Ma Monikazi sang before she was born: “Be strong, little one. Winter’s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we’re strong!”
Circle the Lion lives in the world of circles.
He drinks from the round waterhole.He plays with round stones.He sleeps under round rocks. He dreams about round friends.
Circle the Lion feels alone in his round world.He leaves his round home to find a similar friend, a friend that looks like him.
Behind the big round bush, he finds a new world.
One animal sits in front of a house.Circle the Lion: “Hello, where am I?”Cat: “Hi, this is our world full of triangles.”Circle the Lion: “Really, nothing is round?”Cat: “No, we love our angles. Look, we all have three angles.
Circle the lion enters the new world. Even from far away, he can already see a lot of animals. He is very excited.
Circle the Lion: “Where am I?”Elephant: “Hi, this is our world of rectangles.”Circle the Lion: “Really, nothing is round?”Giraffe: “No, we love our angles. Look, we all have four angles.”
Circle the Lion sadly walks away. He leaves sad triangles and rectangles behind.
He has no idea where to find a round friend.Tired from his search he takes a break under a tree.
Leopard: “Yoohoo, who are you? What are you doing?”Circle the Lion: “I am Circle the Lion. I am looking for a round friend to play with. But I only found triangles and rectangles. Can you help me?”
Leopard: “I have a lot of circles on my fur. Can we play together?”Circle the Lion: “Oh, good idea! You look like a perfect round friend.”Circle the Lion and the leopard with his circles play together for a long time.
One day they get a little bored. They have only each other and only circles to play with.Leopard: “It would be fun to play with others.”Circle the Lion: “Do you remember what I told you about the other worlds?“
The leopard writes an invitation to all shapes.
All animals with different shapes come to the party.Mouse: “Hey Circle the lion, look what we found out! We can also be a circle.”Snake: “I can be a circle too.”Circle the Lion: “Oh wow, that is so cool.”

Once upon a time, there was a beautiful bird that loved to sing.
It woke up every morning at sunrise and sang sweetly through the woods.
All animals wondered where this sweet music came from.
Because the bird was shy, it hid and no one knew who it was.
One day, all the animals planned to wake up before sunrise.
They wanted to find the source of this sweet music.
When the sun begun to rise in the morning, the bird started to sing.
Everyone came out from hiding and applauded the bird as soon as it had finished singing.
The beautiful bird became the chief entertainer of the whole village from then on.
One special Friday Yusuf ’s father gets dressed before a flicker of light brightens the sky. He pulls on his heavy weather-proof jacket and the green woollen cap that covers his ears. He waves his boy goodbye. Yusuf ’s eyes brighten when Papa says, “Today is the day I will catch a fish and bring a gift home for you.”
A fish and a gift? Oh, what will it be? Papa cycles down to Muizenberg Beach. Squeak squeak go the wheels all the way to Surfer’s Corner.Gulls circle the sky. “Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” they cry. “What will you bring back for Yusuf?”Papa rings his bell. “Wait and see what it will be!”
The fishermen watch the sun rise. They check their nets. They check their oars. They listen to the wind. They drag their boats down to the water. Yusuf ’s grandfather, Oupa Salie was a treknet fisherman. Before him his father, Oupagrootjie Ridwaan, knew the sea too.
The boat rides into the waves. Papa’s arms stretch to the oar. His leg braces against the side. His neck strains, his back muscles ripple.Papa sings as he works: “Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don’t you stop.”
All day long Yusuf looks at the sky. It is bright and clear and windless. A fish and a gift! What will Papa bring home from the sea? Sometimes he brings a beautiful shell. Sometimes he brings a jewel green bottle rinsed by the waves.
Some days Yusuf ’s father brings a story. Like the time they found sea turtles on the sand, hundreds washed up in a storm.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cried the gulls. “What will you do to help the turtles?”Papa said, “We saved those turtles, I tell you straight. We sent them back to the ocean, every last one.”
Always Papa brings a song. He sings the song while he pulls the oars. He sings the song while he pulls the nets. He sings the song as he winds the ropes. He sings the song as he cycles home. “Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don’t you stop.”
Ouma Safiya wants a nice fat yellowtail for her supper. Mother wants a new dress.“Don’t be silly,” says Ouma. “You’ll be lucky if they catch even a tiny crab. More likely it will be fish tail Friday. There’s not so many fish left in the sea.”Yusuf holds Ouma’s hand. They cross the road at the bathing cabins.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cry the gulls perched on the bright rooftops. “What is for supper?”
Last year the fishermen fought with the surfers. Angry fists and shouting words.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cried the gulls.“There’s enough sea for everybody,” said Yusuf ’s father. He showed them the fishing licence that had been Oupa Salie’s. “Waves for all. Water for free.”
Ouma Safiya watches through her binoculars, her fingers curled in curiosity. The shark siren sounds. Swimmers run back to the sand and grab their towels. Surfers rush to the shore, carrying their boards under their arms. Under the showers they strip off their wetsuits.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cry the gulls. “What will Yusuf ’s father bring from the ocean?”
Yusuf’s father and uncle and cousins heave and pull. A little shark has been caught. It twists and thrashes in the waves. Yusuf’s father untangles the nets, singing to the shark: “Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don’t you stop.”When the shark at last is free it streaks back into the waves, leaving only one fat yellowtail in the net. Ouma Safiya will be pleased.
The men pull the boat in and coil up the cables. A hard white triangle catches Papa’s finger.“Whaaat? Whaaat? Whaaat?” cry the gulls. “What did you bring back for Yusuf?”As the sun goes down, Papa answers the gulls. “A lucky shark tooth for my boy.”At home Yusuf holds his gift up to the stars.
Amara was walking through the park. The trees in the park were green and healthy. But, there was one tree that was brown and dry.
"This tree needs water," said Amara to herself.She watered the tree and it came to life with new growth.It was a magnificent green tree.
Then, the tree spoke! "You watered me and brought me back to life," said the tree."I'm a magic tree, I shall grant you three wishes."
Amara made her first wish."I wish for a red bicycle," she said cautiously.Abracadabra! A red bicycle appeared.
She made her second wish after thinking for a few moments."I wish for a radio," said Amara. Abracadabra! A radio appeared.
Amara made her third wish."I wish for pink crystal earrings," she said happily.Abracadabra! Pink crystal earrings appeared.
The magic tree said, "You have everything that you wanted."Amara smiled, "Yes I do, but those things were not for me." The magic tree looked confused.
"The bicycle is for my older brother. He outgrew his bicycle. The radio is for Dad. His radio broke. The earrings are for Mum. She loves fancy earrings," explained Amara."And they will all share with me!" she added.
