Her nose was so long she could pick fruit from high branches.
Her nose was so long she could shower her back with water. From that day, all elephants had long and useful trunks.
Kombe and Juma were poor neighbours. They did everything by themselves.
They wished they had a donkey. He would carry things for them.
Kombe said, “Let us buy a donkey together.” They were happy.
When Kombe's father died, Kombe inherited riches. He forgot Juma.
Kombe wanted donkey meat for his dogs. Juma needed the donkey for work.
The judge said, “Each of you can take half the donkey.”
Kombe killed the donkey. Juma carried things for himself once again.
Kombe wanted to burn his hut and build a new one.
Juma said, “Mine will burn too.” The judge agreed with Kombe.
Juma’s hut burned. The judge said, “Kombe burned only his hut.”
Juma had no donkey, no hut. He slept under the tree.
Juma worked hard. He had a good crop of peas.
Kombe’s boys ate most of the peas from Juma’s land.
The boys said, “Ask our father to pay for your peas.”
Juma said, “I don’t want your money. I want my peas.”
The judge told Juma, “Cut the boys open. Take your peas.”
Juma refused to listen. Kombe cried, “Let the elders decide.”
The elders told Kombe, "You killed the donkey. You burned his hut."
They said to Juma, "Killing Kombe's sons is wrong too."
Kombe gave Juma half of his property. They lived happily.
One day,  Rabbit was walking by the riverside.
Hippo was there too,  going for a stroll and eating some nice green grass.
Hippo didn't see that Rabbit was there and she accidentally stepped on Rabbit's foot. Rabbit started screaming at Hippo,  "You Hippo! Can't you see that you're stepping on my foot?"
Hippo apologised to Rabbit,  "I'm so sorry. I didn't see you. Please forgive me!" But Rabbit wouldn't listen and he shouted at Hippo,  "You did that on purpose! Someday,  you'll see! You're going to pay!"
Rabbit went to find Fire and said,  "Go,  burn Hippo when she comes out of the water to eat grass. She stepped on me!"  Fire answered,  "No problem,  Rabbit,  my friend. I'll do just what you ask."
Later,  Hippo was eating grass far from the river when,  "Whoosh!" Fire burst into flame. The flames began to burn Hippo's hair.
Hippo started to cry and ran for the water. All her hair was burned off by the fire. Hippo kept crying,  "My hair has burned in the fire! My hair is all gone! My beautiful hair!"
Rabbit was happy that Hippo's hair was burned. And to this day,  for fear of fire,  the hippo never goes far from the water.

One day, the hyena's son died.
A donkey heard the news. He ran to his relatives and said, "The hyena's son is dead." All the other donkeys said, "The hyena's son? That's good news. All the hyenas are our enemies."
One old donkey said, "Brothers, we must go to the hyena's funeral and show respect.""What? Go to the hyena's funeral?" The other donkeys said. "We don't want to go. We're frightened. The hyenas will eat us."
"Listen," said the old donkey. "If we don't go, the hyenas will be angry with us. They will have a reason to eat us.""You are right," said all the other donkeys. "We must go to the hyena's funeral. If we go, the hyenas will be happy with us. Perhaps they will become our friends."
The hyenas saw the donkeys outside their house."Why are the donkeys here? Have they come to laugh at us?" The hyenas wondered.The donkeys heard the hyenas. They were frightened and they began to sing.
This was the donkeys' song:Great hyenas, you hunt all night.  And we hear you sing in the cold moonlight.Your teeth are long. Your eyes are bright. Though your food is black, your dung is white.But now your son lies on his bed. And he is dead! Our lord is dead!
The dead hyena's uncle answered them with another song: Your song is good. Your words are sweet. Come in, dear donkeys. Take a seat!But what did you bring for us to eat? Hyenas are hungry. Hyenas want meat!
The donkeys were very frightened now."Let's run away," said one. "We can't. The hyenas will chase us," said another.
The oldest donkey said, "My lords, we came to show respect to you. We are sorry that your son is dead. We will pray to God to comfort you. Now we must go back to our home."
The donkeys began to go."Wait!" the hyenas said. "You cannot leave. You must give us something to eat. Cut off your lips and give them to us."
The donkeys looked at each other."If we give them our lips, perhaps they will let us go," they thought.
The hyenas cut off the donkeys' lips, and ate them.
Again, the donkeys tried to go.
"Stop!" Cried the dead hyena's uncle. "My brothers, will you let these donkeys go? Look at them! We can see their teeth! They are laughing at us!""They are laughing! They are laughing!" said all the hyenas.
They jumped on the donkeys. They killed them, and began to eat them.
Before the oldest donkey died, he looked at the hyenas and said, "Wicked hyenas, we came with our song to comfort you but we were wrong! Next time you are hungry, don't pretend that you need a reason to eat your friend!"
I like my teacher very much.
She is beautiful. She is a good teacher. She is kind and patient.
She braided her hair pretty nice.
She placed colorful beads in her hair.
The beads are green, white, red, and yellow.
Mom, could you please braid my hair just like my teacher's?
When I grow older, I will also place colorful beads on my hair.
I will grow up to be just like my teacher!
Mama K has been harvesting cabbages all week. Doobie,  Maya and Duksie help Mama K in her vegetable garden on Saturday mornings. Today the children are going to help with counting and packing the cabbages. Then Baba K will take boxes of cabbages to sell at the market.
The taxi drops off the children at the garden gate. They can see the huge heap of cabbages piled up near Baba K's old truck. "Yo! What a lot of cabbages!" says Maya pointing. "There must be a thousand cabbages there!" laughs Duksie. "No way! Two hundred at the most!" disagrees Doobie.
Mama K is waiting at the gate. "Hello everyone,  I'm happy to see you!" she greets the children. "Now let's get to work. You'll need to count the cabbages and put them into boxes,  12 cabbages in each box. I have 20 boxes. Two of you can each pack 7 boxes and one of you can pack 6 boxes."
The children stand around the pile of cabbages. They talk about different ways to count the cabbages. "I think I will count mine in 2s," Maya says. "I like counting in 4s," says Duksie,  "it's quicker."  "I'm going to count in 3s,  just to be different!" pipes up Doobie.
Soon the children have filled 20 boxes. "Good work!" exclaims Mama K. "Look,  there are some cabbages left over. My pigs love cabbages so let's share these with them," she suggests. "How many cabbages did you pack into boxes? How many cabbages were left over?" she asks the children.
The next job is to write the price on each box and then help Baba K load the boxes on his truck. They must put half the boxes on one side of the truck and half on the other side,  to balance the load.
"We're almost done!" says Baba K. "Let's see,  how many more boxes we must still put on each side to balance the load?"
Soon all 20 boxes are loaded onto the truck. Baba K warms up the engine and drives off to market. "If I can sell all the boxes," he thinks to himself,  "I'll have enough money to fix the pig pen and get a surprise for the children!"
Back at the farm,  Mama K and the children water plants and rake leaves. By twelve o'clock they are all tired. Mama K tells them,  "It's time for your treat. Can you guess what it I have for you today?"
She goes inside to fetch their surprise. The children wait patiently for her to return while they guess what she might bring them. When she comes down the path her apron pockets are bulging!
"Let's see if you guessed right! What's in store for you today?" Mama K tips out her apron pockets and a pile of yellow apples falls onto the table. "See,  I was right!" Duksie squeals. Mama K tells the children,  "Now remember the rule. Share fair! No one to get more or less than the other!"
First the children count the apples in 2s. The count: 2,  4,  6,  8,  10,  12,  14,  16,  and 1 apple left over, Altogether there are 17 apples.
Next,  they share out the apples equally. There are 2 apples left over. The children then put their apples in their bags to take home. How many does each child get?
"Let's cut the 2 apples to share between us," suggests Duksie. "How many parts of the apple will we each get?" asks Maya. "I know the answer!" smiles Doobie.
Just then Baba K arrives home from market. The truck is empty and Baba K is smiling. "I sold all the cabbages. Now I can fix the pig pen and buy you that soccer ball you wanted.  "Yay!" shout the children."
There was a time when all the animals lived together as friends. One day, they decided to have a meeting to elect a king.
Rooster wanted to be king. So he lied to the other animals. He told them, "The red comb on my head is fire! Don't touch the comb on my head!"
The other animals believed Rooster. They decided to elect Rooster as their king. The animals hoped that Rooster's fire would help them in cold weather.
Then came a day when it rained. And rained. And rained. It was cold. Everything was wet and cold.
"Where can we get fire to warm our bodies?" Rabbit asked the other animals.
"We can get fire from the comb on Rooster's head. Rooster is our king because he has fire on his head," said Monkey.
The animals agreed with Monkey. They sent Fox to collect fire from king Rooster.
Fox found Rooster in a deep sleep. So he decided to take fire without asking Rooster.
Fox collected some dry grass. He put the grass next to the comb on Rooster's head. Nothing happened. The grass did not catch fire.
"Wake up king Rooster!" yelled Fox. "We need fire now."
But Rooster could not give fire to Fox.Fox was angry.
Fox went back to the other animals. He told them the truth about the comb on Rooster's head. From that day, no one was afraid of Rooster.  And foxes eat roosters and their families.
This is Azizi. Azizi is my doll.
I like Azizi because he always smiles.
After I wake up I wash my face. Then I look for Azizi.
When I find Azizi I brush his hair.
When I eat breakfast I feed Azizi.
When I eat sweets I give one to Azizi.
But Azizi never eats his sweet. I wonder why!
I walk around the compound picking flowers.
I give a flower to Azizi. But he never says,  "Thank you."
I wash Azizi clean before my mother bathes me.
I dress Azizi in red because I love the colour red.
When I go to sleep,  I lay Azizi beside me.
In a tiny village of  Lumela, lives a little boy called Chipego.  Chipego lives with his father, mother and his  little sister Mutinta.  There is one more special member of the family, Pendo the cow. Chipego helps his father to look after Pendo in exchange for pocket money that he uses to buy books. Meet Chipego. He is 10 years old and in Grade 5 at the village school. Chipego always comes top of his class. "What's his secret?" his schoolmates ask themselves."He's excellent in reading and writing. How does he do it?" they wonder. Chipego tells them it is because he reads lots of books. While they waste their time doing nothing, he spends all his free time reading.
Chipego sometimes earns K80.00 a week in pocket money. He spends most of the pocket money on books at the second-hand book shop in his village.So how does Chipego earn enough pocket money for these books? Read on to find out.
Meet Pendo, the family's milking cow. She produces over 20 litres of milk per day. Chipego's father sells the milk.A cow needs food and water, and time to graze in the field. So each day after school, Chipego helps with this work. Chipego's father gives him pocket money for the work he does. And it is this money that Chipego saves to buy books each week.
First, Chipego gives Pendo a bunch of carrots. He gives her exactly eight carrots a day. Each day he picks the carrots from his father's vegetable garden, enough for a day at a time.You can work it out. You will find that Pendo eats nearly 60 carrots a week. Can you tell exactly how many?
After that, Chipego takes Pendo to graze in the fields. His father warned him to watch the time and give Pendo not  more than three quarters of an hour to graze.Pendo usually starts grazing at about14:15 hrs, so that Chipego can take her back to the milking shed at 15 hours. In winter when it gets dark earlier, Chipego may start grazing earlier, around 13:30 hrs.
Next Chipego gives Pendo water. Without water Pendo won't produce milk, no matter how much Chipego feeds her. Chipego fetches buckets of water from the village pump because there isn't one nearby.Pendo's trough holds about 30 litres of water. Chipego's bucket only holds 5 litres. So to fill the trough Chipego has to make many trips. Can you work out how many trips he has to make?
Then, Chipego takes Pendo to his father to get her daily 12 kg bag of grain. Chipego calculates that's almost 90 kg a week.Each bag costs K39.00. Chipego works out the cost of grain for each week. First he works out the cost of 7 bags at K40.00, which makes K280.00 Then he subtracts K7.00 to get K273.00 "That's over K1 000 a month!" Chipego estimates. Is he correct?
Chipego's father milks Pendo twice a day. She produces about 24 litres of milk a day, so about 12 litres for each milking.Sometimes Chipego helps with the milking but it is not as easy as it looks. "One day," he thinks to himself, "I will have my own cows and I will have to do all the milking myself."
His father pours the milk from the big bucket into smaller two litre cans or one litre bottles. He then sells the milk for K8.00 a litre.Once a week Chipego's father donates 25 litres of milk to Bulela School feeding scheme. Each child gets a quarter litre of this milk. That means that 100 children get milk on this day.
For each litre of milk sold, his father gives Chipego 50 ngwee. That doesn't sound like a lot, but if his father sells 24 litres a day, it adds up to quite a bit. Can you tell how much?Chipego saves his money until Saturday when he makes a trip to the book shop. Each book costs less than k10.00, so in a good week, he can buy quite a few.
Chipego also loves to drink Pendo's milk. His father says that milk helps to build strong bones and teeth and makes a person fit and healthy.So by drinking milk and eating lots of vegetables from his father's garden, Chipego is strong and healthy. He seldom gets sick and never goes hungry. His mother loves making mabisi using Pendo's milk too. His young sister enjoys adding the milk to her chibwantu! Hmmm! Yummy!
Chipego never forgets to thank Pendo at the end of each day. He rewards her with extra carrots or spinach leaves that he finds lying around the garden."Thank you Pendo, you are my best friend! It is thanks to you that I am strong, healthy and clever. If not for you I would never be able to buy all the books that help me be top of my class." One day I will be a veterinary  doctor because of you!Pendo is very lucky because Mutinta, Chipego's mother and Father also rewards her! What an amazing cow!

I see fire again.
The fire is burning brightly.
The fire can cook meat and vegetables.
The fire can keep me warm.
The orange light of the fire gives me light when it is dark.
The fire crackles and pops.
Fire is powerful and can be dangerous.
We must be careful when lighting fires or playing with fire.
There was once an old woman living by herself inside a bottle. She complained all the time.
One day a fairy passed by her home and saw her looking very sad.
The fairy stopped and asked her, “What is the problem? Why are you so sad?”
“I am tired of living in a bottle,” replied the old lady.
The fairy said to her, “Stand up, clap your hands twice, and turn around three times.”
After doing what she was told to do, the old woman found herself in a small house.
After a few days the fairy came back and found the woman still unhappy.
The fairy asked her, “What is wrong now? Why are you sad?”
“This house is too small. I do not like it,” responded the old woman.
The fairy said to her, “Stand up, clap your hands twice, and turn around three times.”
After doing what she was told to do, the old woman found herself in a big house.
The fairy came to see the old woman again. She found her still unhappy and grumpy.
The fairy asked her, “What is wrong old lady?” The old lady responded, “This house is dark and dirty.”
The fairy said to her, “Stand up, clap your hands twice, and turn around three times.”
After doing what she was told to do, the old woman found herself back inside the bottle.
The old woman could not see the blessings she received. She ended up in her bottle, alone and unhappy.
Once upon a time,  Hen and Eagle were friends. They lived in peace with all the other birds. None of them could fly.
One day,  there was famine in the land. Eagle had to walk very far to find food. She came back very tired. "There must be an easier way to travel!" said Eagle.
After a good night's sleep,  Hen had a brilliant idea. She began collecting the fallen feathers from all their bird friends. "Let's sew them together on top of our own feathers," she said. "Perhaps that will make it easier to travel."
Eagle was the only one in the village with a needle,  so she started sewing first. She made herself a pair of beautiful wings and flew high above Hen. Hen borrowed the needle but she soon got tired of sewing. She left the needle on the cupboard and went into the kitchen to prepare food for her children.
But the other birds had seen Eagle flying away. They asked Hen to lend them the needle to make wings for themselves too. Soon there were birds flying all over the sky.
When the last bird returned the borrowed needle,  Hen was not there. So her children took the needle and started playing with it. When they got tired of the game,  they left the needle in the sand.
Later that afternoon,  Eagle returned. She asked for the needle to fix some feathers that had loosened on her journey. Hen looked on the cupboard. She looked in the kitchen. She looked in the yard. But the needle was nowhere to be found.
"Just give me a day," Hen begged Eagle. "Then you can fix your wing and fly away to get food again." "Just one more day," said Eagle. "If you can't find the needle,  you'll have to give me one of your chicks as payment."
When Eagle came the next day,  she found Hen scratching in the sand,  but no needle. So Eagle flew down very fast and caught one of the chicks. She carried it away. Forever after that,  whenever Eagle appears,  she finds Hen scratching in the sand for the needle.
As the shadow of Eagle's wing falls on the ground,  Hen warns her chicks. "Get out of the bare and dry land." And they respond: "We are not fools. We will run."
Lynne, Oupa Karel and Anton were getting things ready for Lynne's birthday party.
Anton and Lynne are going to bake a cake. Oupa Karel reads the recipe.
"Let's mix these ingredients in the big bowl," said Lynne.
Anton stirred the ingredients and made a big mess.
"The cake feels heavy now," said Oupa Karel.
"Your friends have arrived," said Oupa Karel.
Anton thought the first present would be heavy because it was big.
It was a pillow and it weighed very little.
Anton thought the next present would be light because it was small.
It was a painted rock and it weighed a lot.
The children said that 1 kilogram of rocks weighs the same as 1 kilogram of feathers.
Lynne's cake was burnt.
Lynne was very sad.
Auntie Mavis asked Anton to guess how much her present weighed.
"It weighs the same as the cake that burned," said Anton.
Everyone said, "happy birthday, Lynne."

Emeka lived in a fine house in Ebiba town. His parents were rich.  Emeka had a dog called Chita. He looked after Chita very well.
Every day, Emeka's father took him to school in his car. He also brought Emeka home after school.One afternoon on their way home, Emeka's father stopped to buy something at a big shop.
From the car, Emeka looked across the road and saw an old man. He was carrying a big load on his head. He was tired and walked slowly. Emeka kept looking at him.
The old man sat under the shade of a tree on the walkway and opened his bag. He had two flat plastic water bottles, which he was making into shoes.
Emeka thought about that old man for a long time. He felt sad. When he got home, he could not eat. He thought about what he could do.
He got up and took some money from his money bag. He called Chita and jumped on his bicycle. Emeka rode to the shop where his father had shopped.
The boy ran into the shop and came out with a bag. He went to where the old man was resting against a tree.Emeka called out, "Good afternoon, sir." The man answered, "Peace to you, my child."
Emeka asked, "Sir, where do you come from? The old man replied, "My child, hunger has chased me from my village. I am here to earn money."
Emeka gave his shopping bag to the old man. Tears filled the man's eyes as he took the sandals from the bag. He thanked Emeka from his heart.
"I must go now before mother starts looking for me," said EmekaThe old man waved to the boy and his dog as they went. "Bless you, my child," he said with a smile.
"Where were you?" mother asked Emeka as soon as he got home. She was worried.Emeka told her everything. She felt touched by his story.
Later, Emeka's father told him, "We are proud of what you did. But you must always tell us before you leave the house." Then he added, "Now, here is the money that you spent!"
Early one morning Vusi's granny called him, "Vusi,  please take this egg to your parents. They want to make a large cake for your sister's wedding."
On his way to his parents, Vusi met two boys picking fruit. One boy grabbed the egg from Vusi and shot it at a tree. The egg broke.
"What have you done?" cried Vusi. "That egg was for a cake. The cake was for my sister's wedding. What will my sister say if there is no wedding cake?"
The boys were sorry for teasing Vusi. "We can't help with the cake, but here is a walking stick for your sister," said one. Vusi continued on his journey.
Along the way he met two men building a house. "Can we use that strong stick?" asked one. But the stick was not strong enough for building, and it broke.
"What have you done?" cried Vusi. "That stick was a gift for my sister. The fruit pickers gave me the stick because they broke the egg for the cake. The cake was for my sister's wedding. Now there is no egg, no cake, and no gift. What will my sister say?"
The builders were sorry for breaking the stick. "We can't help with the cake, but here is some thatch for your sister," said one. And so Vusi continued on his journey.
Along the way, Vusi met a farmer and a cow. "What delicious thatch, can I have a nibble?" asked the cow. But the thatch was so tasty that the cow ate it all!
"What have you done?" cried Vusi. "That thatch was a gift for my sister. The builders gave me the thatch because they broke the stick from the fruit pickers. The fruit pickers gave me the stick because they broke the egg for my sister's cake. The cake was for my sister's wedding. Now there is no egg, no cake, and no gift. What will my sister say?"
The cow was sorry she was greedy. The farmer agreed that the cow could go with Vusi as a gift for his sister. And so Vusi carried on.
But the cow ran back to the farmer at supper time.  Vusi got lost on his journey. He arrived very late for his sister's wedding. The guests were already eating.
"What shall I do?" cried Vusi. "The cow that ran away was a gift, in return for the thatch the builders gave me. The builders gave me the thatch because they broke the stick from the fruit pickers. The fruit pickers gave me the stick because they broke the egg for the cake. The cake was for the wedding. Now there is no egg, no cake, and no gift."
Vusi's sister thought for a while, then she said, "Vusi my brother, I don't really care about gifts. I don't even care about the cake! We are all here together, I am happy. Now put on your smart clothes and let's celebrate this day!" And so, that's what Vusi did.
I saw a big truck driving down the road.
A car came driving up the road.
The truck driver was talking on his cellphone.
He was not looking at the road.
There was a big accident.
An ambulance and the police came to help.
Two tow trucks came. They towed the truck and the car.
I was shocked.
Long long ago people didn't know anything. They didn't know how to plant crops, or how to weave cloth,  or how to make iron tools. The god Nyame up in the sky had all the wisdom of the world. He kept it safe in a clay pot.
One day, Nyame decided that he would give the pot of wisdom to Anansi. Every time Anansi looked in the clay pot, he learned something new. It was so exciting!
Greedy Anansi thought, "I'll keep the pot safe at the top of a tall tree. Then I can have it all to myself!" He spun a long thread, wound it round the clay pot, and tied it to his stomach. He began to climb the tree. But it was hard climbing the tree with the pot bumping him in the knees all the time.
All the time Anansi's young son had been standing at the bottom of the tree watching. He said, "Wouldn't it be easier to climb if you tied the pot to your back instead?" Anansi tried tying the clay pot full of wisdom to his back, and it really was a lot easier.
In no time he reached the top of the tree. But then he stopped and thought, "I'm supposed to be the one with all the wisdom, and here my son was cleverer than me!" Anansi was so angry about this that he threw the clay pot down out of the tree.
It smashed into pieces on the ground. The wisdom was free for everyone to share. And that is how people learned to farm, to weave cloth, to make iron tools, and all the other things that people know how to do.
Odongo and Apiyo lived in the city with their father. They looked forward to the holidays. Not only because school was closed, but because they went to visit their grandmother. She lived in a fishing village near a large lake.
Odongo and Apiyo were excited because it was time to visit their grandmother again. They packed their bags and got ready for their long journey the next day. They could not sleep and talked about the holiday the whole night.
Early the next morning, they left for the village in their father's car. They drove past mountains, wild animals, and tea plantations. They counted cars and sang songs.
After a while, the children were tired and fell asleep.
Father woke up Odongo and Apiyo as they arrived in the village. They found Nyar-Kanyada, their grandmother, resting on a mat under a tree. In thier language, Nyar-Kanyada means "daughter of the people of Kanyada." She was a strong and beautiful woman.
Nyar-Kanyada welcomed them into the house. She danced around the room singing with joy. Her grandchildren were excited to give her the presents they brought from the city. "First open my gift," said Odongo. "No, my gift first!" said Apiyo.
After she opened the presents, Nyar-Kanyada blessed her grandchildren in a traditional way.
Then Odongo and Apiyo went outside. They chased butterflies and birds.
They climbed trees and splashed in the water of the lake.
When it was dark they returned to the house for dinner. Before they could finish eating, they were falling asleep!
The next day, the children's father drove back to the city leaving them with Nyar-Kanyada.
Odongo and Apiyo helped their grandmother with household chores. They fetched water and firewood. They collected eggs from the chickens and picked vegetables from the garden.
Nyar-Kanyada taught her grandchildren to make soft ugali to eat with stew. She showed them how to make coconut rice to eat with roast fish.
One morning, Odongo took his grandmother's cows to graze. They ran onto a neighbour's farm. The farmer was angry with Odongo. He threatened to keep the cows for eating his crops. After that day, the boy made sure that the cows did not get into trouble again.
On another day, the children went to the market place with Nyar-Kanyada. She had a stall selling vegetables, sugar and soap. Apiyo liked to tell customers the price of items. Odongo would pack the items that customers bought.
At the end of the day they drank chai tea together. They helped grandmother to count the money she earned.
But too soon the holidays were over. The children had to go back to the city. Nyar-Kanyada gave Odongo a cap and Apiyo a sweater. She packed food for their journey.
When their father came to fetch them,  they did not want to leave. The children begged Nyar-Kanyada to go with them to the city. She smiled and said, "I am too old for the city. I will be waiting for you to visit me again."
Odongo and Apiyo both hugged her tightly, and said goodbye.
When Odongo and Apiyo went back to school they told their friends about life in the village.   Some children felt that life in the city was good. Others felt that the village was better. But most of all, everyone agreed that Odongo and Apiyo had a wonderful grandmother!
I woke up very early to get ready for school.
Mother was annoyed. I was too slow dressing up.
I ate my breakfast quickly.
I met my friends in school.
I opened my school bag. Oops! I still had mother's phone! I returned it in the bag.
It was time to go home. I looked into my school bag. Oops! Mother's phone was not in my school bag.
I started crying. The teacher asked, "What is the problem, Wanjiku?" I could not talk. I covered my face with my hand.
Finally, I said, "Mother's phone is lost." Teacher was surprised. We started looking for the phone.
I danced around in class. "Thank you teacher. Thank you teacher!"
I put mother's phone in my school bag. I said to myself,  "I will not play with mother's phone again."
Once there was a family who had a tree with such sweet fruit that everyone visited their compound to taste the fruit. The family also had a very beautiful daughter. Many people admired her dazzling beauty, white eyes and above all, her great personality.
When she grew up into a young woman, young and old men flocked to her home seeking her hand in marriage. Her parents decided that the man who could sit in the compound the whole day without eating any fruit would be given her hand in marriage.
The news spread all over the village. The first man to come was the head of all farmers in the village. He was handsome, rich and young. He was welcomed and served the fruit. He sat for a few minutes, but before long, he ate the fruit and was sent away.
The leader of animal keepers was next. He was handsome, young and rich. The girl admired him. But when he was served with the fruit, he immediately ate it, and was sent away.
The next man to come had many pieces of land. He was arrogant and ugly. The girl prayed that he would eat and go away. When served, he refused to eat. The time passed, and the girl started begging him to eat. By around four o'clock, he was overcome with hunger, and he ate. He, too, was sent away.
Next, the chief came around. He was arrogant, old,  and ugly. No one liked him in the village. The girl wished that he would eat and go away. When he was served with the fruit, he refused to eat. He stayed the whole day. At about six o'clock, he asked if he could use the toilet.
A few days later, a young, handsome, rich prince arrived. The girl looked at him in admiration. She took him aside, and begged him not to eat the fruit. She served him much less fruit than the other suitors. But by midday the prince had already eaten and was sent away. The girl burst into tears of anger and disappointment.
The next day, a farmer came around. He was poor and lazy, but he was young and popular among many people for being a great talker. He came determined to win. The girl served him many fruits and asked him to eat and go away.
Her parents had to hand over their daughter to the "lazy one." The girl begged to be saved from her fate, but her parents could do nothing. As the farmer took her home, he sang such a beautiful song while clapping his hands. Many people flocked to the road to see the couple.
Among the people were servants of the rich prince. They called the farmer aside, and offered him money and cattle if he would leave the girl. Without a moment's hesitation, he took the money and the cattle, and walked off.
The servants dressed the girl in fine clothes and took her to the palace, straight to the prince. Before long, her parents were called and a ceremony was organised to join the two in marriage.
Grandma's garden was wonderful. It was full of sorghum, millet, and cassava. But best of all were the bananas. Although Grandma had many grandchildren, I secretly knew that I was her favourite. She invited me often to her house. She also told me little secrets. But there was one secret she did not share with me. Where she ripened bananas.
One day I saw a big straw basket placed in the sun outside Grandma's house. When I asked what it was for, the only answer I got was, "It's my magic basket." Next to the basket, there were several banana leaves that Grandma turned from time to time. I was curious. "What are the leaves for, Grandma?" I asked. The only answer I got was, "They are my magic leaves."
It was so interesting watching Grandma, the bananas, the banana leaves and the big straw basket. But Grandma sent me off to my mother on an errand. "Grandma, please, let me watch as you prepare." "Don't be stubborn, child, do as you are told," she insisted. I took off running.
When I returned, Grandma was sitting outside but with neither the basket nor the bananas. "Grandma,  where is the basket, where are all the bananas, and where..." But the only answer I got was, "They are in my magic place." It was so disappointing!
Two days later, Grandma sent me to fetch her walking stick from her bedroom. As soon as I opened the door, I was welcomed by the strong smell of ripening bananas. In the inner room was grandma's big magic straw basket. It was well hidden by an old blanket. I lifted it and sniffed that glorious smell.
Grandma's voice startled me when she called, "What are you doing? Hurry up and bring me the stick." I hurried out with her walking stick. "What are you smiling about?" Grandma asked. Her question made me realise that I was still smiling at the discovery of her magic place.
The following day when Grandma came to visit my mother, I rushed to her house to check the bananas once more. There was a bunch of very ripe ones. I picked one and hid it in my dress. After covering the basket again, I went behind the house and quickly ate the banana. It was the sweetest banana I had ever tasted.
The following day, when Grandma was in the garden picking vegetables, I sneaked in and peered at the bananas. Nearly all were ripe. I couldn't help taking a bunch of four. As I tiptoed towards the door, I heard Grandma coughing outside. I just managed to hide the bananas under my dress and walked past her.
The following day was market day. Grandma woke up early. She always took ripe bananas and cassava to sell at the market. I did not hurry to visit her that day. But I could not avoid her for long.
Later that evening I was called by my mother and father, and Grandma. I knew why. That night as I lay down to sleep, I knew I could never steal again. Not from grandma, not from my parents, and certainly not from anyone else.
One day after a heavy rain, Iman looked across the sky and saw colours in it for the first time.
"How beautiful," she thought. Someone must have worked very hard, painting the sky with a brush like Daddy paints houses.
She ran to her sister and said, "Zarah look! Someone has painted the sky for us and made it beautiful."
But Zarah said, "No, silly. That is a rainbow. You are little and I am big. I know why it is in the sky. Let me show you."
Zarah took Iman to the zoo. She said, "Rainbows do not appear because lion cubs roar for the first time or because elephants are born."
She took Iman to a field of flowers and said, "They do not appear because butterflies lose their colours in the clouds."
She showed Iman a book. She said, "They do not even appear because rhinos run across the ground and scare colours up into the sky."
"I know why rainbows really appear. Mummy told me and now I'll tell you." Zarah took Iman's hand and led her to a playground.
"Rainbows appear in the sky because of children like you and me. One day, colours looked down from above and liked what they could see."
"They saw children with light skin, dark skin and everything in between. They thought, 'How wonderful it must be to be as beautiful as these.'"
"They came together in the sky and spoke about what they could do. They decided, 'If we are to be beautiful we must do it as a group.'"
"Now they join together and shine as brightly as they can. Hoping to be as beautiful as the children they see, just like you and me."
I have a friend. She lives in my house.
When I am happy, so is she.
When I cry, she cries too.
But I cannot hear her voice. My friend lives inside the mirror.
“Come out,” I tell her, “we will play.” She does not come out.
I am not happy. I go to sleep.
She comes out of the mirror in my sleep! And we have fun.
We play, we run, we shout and scream together.
When I talk to her, she also talks to me.
In the morning, my friend will go back into the mirror.
But I don't mind at all. We will play again in my dreams!
Hare met Elephant carrying a pot of honey.
Elephant carried Hare on his back. Hare ate Elephant’s honey.
They found a big buffalo drinking water in a river.
Hare wanted to know who was stronger, Buffalo or Elephant.
Hare said he had an idea how to find out.
Hare tied one end of a rope around Elephant’s waist.
Hare tied the other end around Buffalo’s waist.
Hare hid in a tree and shouted, “Pull!”
Buffalo and Elephant pulled. Elephant pulled Buffalo.
Buffalo pulled Elephant. Neither could win.
Hare cut the rope, closer to Buffalo.Elephant fell over!
Hare praised Buffalo saying, “You are stronger.”
Once upon a time, there was a village called Izagodo. All the people in this village were very young. There was not a single old man or old woman in the village.
The young men and women of Izagodo danced and had fun. They ate what they liked and drank anything that made them drunk. They had fun all day and all night.Very soon, they forgot how to work.
They also forgot anything that happened the day before.The young men and women of Izagodo woke up one day and all the food was finished. There was not a drop of wine left. The musical instruments were all broken.
There was no music for dancing. But they couldn't even dance anymore because they were hungry and weak.They went to the compound of Oza, the village chief, and cried bitterly.
They cried and wailed.The young chief came out of his large hut and pleaded, "Stop! Dear people of Izagodo. Please stop crying. We might die soon, let us save our strength for a few more breaths."
The people shouted, "You are our chief! You must save us!"Chief Oza was quiet. Then after a while, he stood up and said, "I am no longer your chief. I shall leave this village and find somewhere peaceful. You can choose another chief."
So Oza went into his hut, packed his things, and left.The people did not know who would be their leader. They did not know what to do. They cried so much more.
Then a small but clear voice said, "I will be your chief!" Everybody turned to look for the owner of the voice. They all looked to each other. They looked and looked. But they could not tell who had spoken.
To the surprise of everyone, a little boy stepped out of the crowd. The boy said, "Yes! I will be chief. I can help you. But you must promise to stop having fun all day and all night. And you must follow my advice."
The young people were moved by the child's courage and promised to obey him.He took them away from the village, to a lush farm. They had food and rested. Then he taught them. He helped them to remember how to farm.
With the little boy as their chief, the people of Izagodo began a life of hard work. They worked and worked. Before long, they had more than enough to eat and drink. They were happy again and had fun. But also they continued to work.
Many nights the little chief would quietly leave the village, to meet with a wise old man.He told him moonlight tales, and stories of great men and women who solved the problems of their people. In time, the boy himself became a wise and powerful man.

Once upon a time,  there lived a man called Mairu in Bubaali Village. He liked to eat meat so much.
One day,  the chairman of Bubaali village invited all the villagers to his wedding that was to take place at his home.
Then Mairu also heard that there was another wedding in Nabuyanja village. "Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!Two parties on the same day!" Mairu imagined.
"Ha! Ha! Ha! I must attend both parties," he said. "I will first walk to Bubaali then come back to Nabuyanja."
Mairu woke up very early in the morning and walked to Bubaali village. He looked around and saw that the party had not yet started. "I will go back to Nabuyanja and return to Bubaali later," Mairu told himself. "Yes! Yes! I hope I will not be late."
Mairu walked gently back to Bubaali hoping to find the meat, rice, sodas and matooke ready. He was now very hungry. When he arrived,  men and women were still preparing the food.
"I left cooks at Bubaali preparing to cook," he thought. "The food must be ready now." Mairu decided to walk back to Nabuyanja under hot sunshine,  i will not loose hope he added!
Mairu arrived at the Bubaali party,  people had already eaten and cleaned the utensils. Guests were giving presents to the bride and the groom. Mairu was very disappointed. He looked displaced and every one became concerned. But his target was to eat enough.
He decided to walk back to Nabuyanja village. Because he was hungry and tired,  he could not walk fast any more.
When he arrived at Nabuyanja village,  the food was over and it was time for the bride and groom giving a speech.
Upon hearing that there was no food,  Mairu fell and fainted. He had missed meat from both parties. All he got was some posho and beans on a small plate yet his target was to eat meat.
Gently, he walked back home cursing never to serve two masters at ago.
I can run with it.
I can jump with it.
I can dance with it.
I can swim with it.
I can skip with it.
I can kick with it.
I can escape with it.
But I can never fly with it.
A long time ago,  three girls went out to collect wood.
It was a hot day so they went down to the river to swim. They played and splashed and swam in the water.
Suddenly,  they realised that it was late. They hurried back to the village.
When they were nearly home,  Nozibele put her hand to her neck. She had forgotten her necklace! "Please come back with me!" she begged her friends. But her friends said it was too late.
Nozibele went back to the river alone. She found her necklace and began hurrying home. But,  she got lost in the dark.
In the distance she saw light coming from a hut. She walked quickly towards it and knocked at the door.
To her surprise,  a dog opened the door and said,  "What do you want?" "I'm lost and I need a place to sleep," said Nozibele. "Come in,  or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele went in.
The dog said,  "Cook for me!" "But I've never cooked for a dog before," Nozibele answered. "Cook,  or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele cooked some food for the dog.
Then the dog said,  "Make the bed for me!" Nozibele answered,  "I've never made a bed for a dog." "Make the bed,  or I'll bite you!" the dog said. Nozibele made the bed.
Every day she had to cook and sweep and wash for the dog. Then one day the dog said,  "Nozibele,  today I have to visit some friends. Sweep the house,  cook the food and wash my things before I come back."
As soon as the dog had gone,  Nozibele took three hairs from her head. She put one hair under the bed,  one behind the door,  and one in the kraal. Then she ran home as fast as she could.
When the dog came back,  he looked for Nozibele. "Nozibele,  where are you?" he shouted. "I'm here,  under the bed," said the first hair. "I'm here,  behind the door," said the second hair. "I'm here,  in the kraal," said the third hair.
The dog knew that Nozibele had tricked him. He ran and ran all the way to the village. But Nozibele's brothers were waiting there with big sticks. The dog turned and ran away and has never been seen since.
Mother Sun decided to visit her sister, Moon. Sister Moon lives on the  other side of the sky. "I will be back soon," said Sun to the clouds.
When Sun left, the mountains put on their white scarves.
Wind had an argument with the trees. The trees became angry. They threw their leaves  all over the place.
The sky started to grumble. She turned grey.
The clouds were sad to see all this. They started crying. There were many tears.
The whole world began to sink under water.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the sky, Sun was ready to leave her sister. She kissed Moon goodbye and went home.
Sky was so happy to see Sun that she turned bright blue. The mountains put on their pretty green dresses.
The wind went to sleep. The trees stretched their branches and smiled.
The clouds were very happy to see mother Sun again. They went away to play.
Lots of little plants popped out of the earth to say, "Hello." The whole world sparkled.
Mother Sun shined her light everywhere. "I told you I would be back," she beamed.
Long time ago, Hare and Hyena were good friends.
Hare said to Hyena, “Let us do farming together.”
Hare suggested that they should plant maize and share duties.
Hare told Hyena, “My work of chasing birds is difficult.”
Hyena agreed to till the land alone.
When Hyena pulled out weeds, Hare sat down singing.
When the maize was ready, Hare enjoyed chasing birds away.
Hare said, “I harvest above the soil. You harvest below.”
Hare harvested all the maize and stored it.
Hyena found only roots under the soil.
Hyena realised that he was cheated. He was angry.
They planted potatoes. Hyena said, “I will harvest above the soil.”
They worked on the farm together, singing.
At harvest time, Hyena harvested only potato leaves.
Hare harvested a lot of big potatoes and stored them.
Hyena chased Hare to get revenge. Their friendship ended.
Andiswa watched the boys play soccer. She wished that she could join them. She asked the coach if she could practise with them.
The coach put his hands on his hips. "At this school,  only boys are allowed to play soccer," he said.
The boys told her to go and play netball. They said that netball is for girls and soccer is for boys. Andiswa was upset.
The next day, the school had a big soccer match. The coach was worried because his best player was sick and could not play.
Andiswa begged the coach, "Please, let me play." The coach was not sure what to do. Then he decided that Andiswa could join the team.
The game was tough. Nobody had scored a goal by half time.
During the second half of the match, Andiswa got the ball. She moved very fast towards the goal post. Andiswa kicked the ball hard and scored a goal.
The crowd went wild with joy. Since that day, girls were also allowed to play soccer at the school.
Sakima lived with his parents and his four year old sister. They lived on a rich man's land. Their grass-thatched hut was at the end of a row of trees.
When Sakima was three years old,  he fell sick and lost his sight. Sakima was a talented boy.
Sakima did many things that other six year old boys did not do. For example, he could sit with older members of the village and discuss important matters.
Sakima's parents  worked at the rich man's house. They left home early in the morning and returned late in the evening. Sakima was left with his little sister.
Sakima loved to sing songs. One day his mother asked him, "Where do you learn these songs from, Sakima?"
Sakima answered, "I just know them, mother. I hear them in my mind and then I sing."
Sakima liked to sing for his little sister, especially,  if she felt hungry. His sister would listen to him singing his favourite song. She would sway to the soothing tune.
"Can you sing it again and again, Sakima," his sister would beg him. Sakima would accept and sing it over and over again.
One evening when his parents returned home, they were very quiet. Sakima knew that there was something wrong.
"What is wrong, mother, father?" Sakima asked. Sakima learned that the rich man's son was missing. The man was very sad and lonely.
"I can sing for him. He might be happy again," Sakima told his parents. But his parents dismissed him. "He is very rich. You are only a blind boy. Do you think your song will help him?"
However,  Sakima did not give up. His little sister supported him. She said, "Sakima's songs soothe me when I am hungry. They will soothe the rich man too."
The following day, Sakima asked his little sister to lead him to the rich man's house.
He stood below a window and began to sing his favourite song. Slowly, the head of the rich man began to show through the window.
The workers stopped what they were doing. They listened to Sakima's beautiful song. But one man said,  "Nobody has been able to console the boss. Does this blind boy think he will console him?"
Sakima finished singing his song and turned to leave. But the rich man rushed out and said, "Please sing again."
At that very moment, two men came carrying someone on a stretcher. They had found the rich man's son beaten up and left on the side of the road.
The rich man was so happy to see his son again. He rewarded Sakima for consoling him. He took his son and Sakima to hospital to check if Sakima could see again.
One day, Anansi the spider picked up some yams in his garden. They were very beautiful and very good yams.He cooked them carefully on the fire. Then he sat down to eat them.
As Anansi was about to eat the first bite, he heard someone knock on the door. "Oh no !" Anansi thought. "Who could it be?" But he opened the door. It was Turtle who looked very tired. "Anansi, please let me in. I've walked so far today and I'm so tired and hungry," Turtle said. So what could Anansi do except let him in?
Anansi was too selfish to share his beautiful and good yams with anyone. So he came up with a nasty plan.As Turtle sat down at the table and started reaching out to grab some yams, Anansi shouted at him, "Turtle, your hands are all dirty! You can't eat with your hands all dirty! Go wash them."Turtle's hands were really dirty. So he crawled gently towards the river, washed his hands and then crawled back to the table.
But meanwhile, Anansi had started swallowing the yams. When Turtle returned, he saw that the yams were gone.Turtle looked at Anansi. "Thank you for inviting me to dinner. If you ever come near my house, come see me and let me make this dinner for you," he told him. And Turtle started crawling slowly towards his house.
After some time, Anansi began to think more and more about the free dinner promised by Turtle. So one day he went to visit.Anansi arrived at Turtle's house at dinner time as the sun was setting over the river. Turtle was lying on a rock in the sun, warming himself like turtles do.When Turtle saw Anansi, he said, "Hello, Anansi, did you come to eat with me?"And Anansi replied, "Yes, that would be very nice, thank you." He was getting hungrier and hungrier.
So Turtle dived to the bottom of the river to set the table for dinner and get everything ready. Anansi waited on the rocks on the bank.Soon Turtle came swimming back and said, "Oh Anansi, it's ready now, come have dinner with me."And Turtle dived again and started eating the green leaves prepared for dinner.
Anansi tried to dive to the bottom of the river, but it was a spider, not a turtle, and he couldn't dive that deep. He always came to the surface.He tried to jump into the river, he tried to dive, but nothing helped. He couldn't come down to eat that dinner.
Finally, Anansi had an idea. He put many stones in his coat pockets and was heavy enough to sink to the bottom of the river. How clever he was!He saw Turtle's table, full of juicy green leaves and lots of other delicious foods. Anansi's mouth was watering.
But just as Anansi grabbed some of that delicious food, Turtle stopped him. "Anansi, aren't you going to dinner with your coat on? We don't do that at home."Anansi, without thinking, replied, "Oh, of course you're right, Turtle, what was I thinking?" He took off his coat.
But without the stones in his pockets to hold him down, Anansi immediately rose to the surface of the river and found himself out of the water. Anansi sadly put her head in the water and watched Turtle eat all the delicious food!
Goat, Dog and Cow were great friends.One day they went on a journey in a taxi.
They reached the end of their journey.The driver asked them to pay their fares.Cow paid her fare.
Dog paid extra, because he did not have the correct money.
The driver was about to give Dog his change.Suddenly Goat ran away without paying.
The driver was very annoyed.He drove away without giving Dog his change.
That is why, even today, Dog runs towards a car to peep inside.He is looking for the driver who owes him change.
Goat runs away from the sound of a car.She is afraid she will be arrested for not paying her fare.
Cow is not bothered by cars.Cow takes her time crossing the road.She knows she paid her fare in full.
Once upon a time, there was a man called Byantaka who had a cow. Each day Byantaka grazed his cow. He also gave the cow water to drink. But Byantaka only had a very small pot for water.
So he went at his neighbour's home to borrow a bigger pot for water. His neighbour agreed to lend Byantaka his biggest clay pot saying, "My neighbour's problem is my problem."
After a few days, Byantaka went to apotter's place and bought a small pot. He took it home. He put the small pot inside the big pot that he had borrowed from his neighbour.
Then he put the big pot, with the small pot inside it,on his head. He carried the big pot to the neighbour who loaned him the pot.
Byantaka told him, "I am returning your pot, it has reproduced." The neighbour was amazed that his pot had produced another pot. He praised Byantaka saying, "Your home is blessed."
After a while, Byantaka went back to his neighbour to borrow the pot again. He did not have good intentions.
The owner of the big pot waited in vain for Byantaka to return his pot. Eventually he went to Byantaka's home and said, "I have come for my pot."
Byantaka told his neighbour, "My friend, our pot died. I was just on my way to tell you the bad news."
His neighbour clapped his hands together in surprise. His face began to swell with anger. He shouted at Byantaka, "I have never heard of a pot dying!"
Byantaka replied, "My friend you should accept these things. Everything that produces must die. I was also very sorry about the big pot's death."
His neighbour was very angry and he went to court to report Byantaka. The judge listened to explanations from both of them. He found the owner of the pot was in the wrong.
"When Byantaka told you that the pot had reproduced, you accepted. When he says that every living thing which reproduces must die, he is correct." That is how the judge judged the case.
Byantaka's neighbour went home walking like a snail. Byantaka had got the big pot with his cleverness.
Odongo and Apiyo lived in the city with their father. They looked forward to the holidays. Not only because school was closed, but because they went to visit their grandmother. She lived in a fishing village near a large lake.
Odongo and Apiyo were excited because it was time to visit their grandmother again. They packed their bags and got ready for their long journey the next day. They could not sleep and talked about the holiday the whole night.
Early the next morning, they left for the village in their father's car. They drove past mountains, wild animals, and tea plantations. They counted cars and sang songs.
After a while, the children were tired and fell asleep.
Father woke up Odongo and Apiyo as they arrived in the village. They found Nyar-Kanyada, their grandmother, resting on a mat under a tree. In thier language, Nyar-Kanyada means “daughter of the people of Kanyada.” She was a strong and beautiful woman.
Nyar-Kanyada welcomed them into the house. She danced around the room singing with joy. Her grandchildren were excited to give her the presents they brought from the city. “First open my gift,” said Odongo. “No, my gift first!” said Apiyo.
After she opened the presents, Nyar-Kanyada blessed her grandchildren in a traditional way.
Then Odongo and Apiyo went outside. They chased butterflies and birds.
They climbed trees and splashed in the water of the lake.
When it was dark they returned to the house for dinner. Before they could finish eating, they were falling asleep!
The next day, the children's father drove back to the city leaving them with Nyar-Kanyada.
Odongo and Apiyo helped their grandmother with household chores. They fetched water and firewood. They collected eggs from the chickens and picked vegetables from the garden.
Nyar-Kanyada taught her grandchildren to make soft ugali to eat with stew. She showed them how to make coconut rice to eat with roast fish.
One morning, Odongo took his grandmother's cows to graze. They ran onto a neighbour's farm. The farmer was angry with Odongo. He threatened to keep the cows for eating his crops. After that day, the boy made sure that the cows did not get into trouble again.
On another day, the children went to the market place with Nyar­Kanyada.She had a stall selling vegetables, sugar and soap. Apiyo liked to tell customers the price of items. Odongo would pack the items that customers bought.
At the end of the day they drank chai tea together. They helped grandmother to count the money she earned.
But too soon the holidays were over. The children had to go back to the city. Nyar-Kanyada gave Odongo a cap and Apiyo a sweater. She packed food for their journey.
When their father came to fetch them, they did not want to leave. The children begged Nyar-Kanyada to go with them to the city. She smiled and said, “I am too old for the city. I will be waiting for you to visit me again.”
Odongo and Apiyo both hugged her tightly, and said goodbye.
When Odongo and Apiyo went back to school they told their friends about life in the village. Some children felt that life in the city was good. Others felt that the village was better. But most of all, everyone agreed that Odongo and Apiyo had a wonderful grandmother!
Sara has a canoe. Her canoe is big. It is by the riverside.
Some women come to the river. One woman has a basin of fruit. Another woman has a chicken. Another woman has a goat. Another woman has two goats. They ask Sara, "How can we get to the other side of the river?" Sara says, "Get in my canoe!"
Then, some men arrive. One man has a fish. Another man has a bicycle. Another man has a sack of maize.
Another man has two sacks of maize. They ask Sara, "How can we get to the other side of the river?" Sara replies, "Get in my canoe!"
Some animals come to the river. They ask Sara, "How can we get across the river?" Sara says, "Get in my canoe!"
The animals get in the canoe. The dog gets in the canoe. The cat gets in the canoe. The monkey gets in the canoe. The rabbit gets in the canoe. The turtle gets in the canoe. The gazelle gets in the canoe.
The elephant arrives at the river. He asks, "How can I get to the other side of the river?" Sara says, "Get in my canoe!" The elephant gets in the canoe. The canoe fills up with water.
The canoe is too small. There isn't enough room.
Sara says, "Hold on! First I'll take the women."
Sara says, "Second, I'll take the men."
Sara says, "Finally, I'll take the animals."
The elephant says, "I'm just going to walk!"
There was a village near a lake.There lived a young girl. Her name was Atieno.
Atieno's father was a famous fisherman. He had his own little fishing canoe. Atieno enjoyed going fishing with her father.
Atieno loved to watch the boys play football. "Let me play with you," she begged them one day. The boys laughed at her, "Go and play hide and seek with girls. "
Girls said to Atieno, "Your legs are too long." Atieno was sad. Each morning, Atieno danced alone with the sun.The sun became her friend.
One day, the sun did not rise. Cocks did not crow. Birds did not sing. Children did not go to school. Even her father did not go fishing.Atieno was sad. "Where is my friend, the sun? Why is it so dark today?"
Atieno told the other children how sad she was. But they laughed at her, "Perhaps your friend the sun, is dead. Or perhaps it ran away from you."Atieno said, "The sun is my friend. It cannot die."
Atieno was so sad that she ran to the house. She kicked her brother's ball very hard.
Atieno thought, "I will play with this ball until my friend, the sun returns." She picked up the ball and ran out with it.
Atieno put the ball on the ground. She thought, "I can play just like those boys." She kicked the ball hard. It went up and up into the cloudy sky.
Everybody stared up. The ball disappeared into the thick clouds. There was total silence.
Suddenly, the thick clouds cleared. The sun appeared. Life returned to the village once again. Everybody prepared to do what they always did.
Atieno could not believe that the sun was back in the village. But most of all, the sun was back in her life. She told the children, "My friend, the sun is back!"
Kadogo and Juma are friends who love running. They run together every day.
One day they were reading maps at school. Juma said, "Let's run across our continent. Let's race, together with Africans from many countries!" "Let's go, we can doit! African unity!" cheered Kadogo.
They decided to carry a unity torch on their journey. They lit the torch and began to run. The race started at the southern tip of our continent, in Cape Town, South Africa.
From South Africa they headed along the west coast. They ran through Namibia, Angola, DRC, Congo and Cameroon. Runners quickly joined them from these countries. The growing group of people rested in Nigeria, in Abuja.
More runners from West Africa joined the friends as they passed through Nigeria.They continued together, following the River Niger.
A sandstorm in Mali made it difficult to run. Juma was the strongest of all of them. He led the way safely, holding the unity torch high.
At Guinea's coast in Conakry the dusty runners washed in the sea. Then they decided to race to Morocco through Senegal and Mauritania. All the way, more people joined them.
At Casablanca, the runners enjoyed playing on the beaches. They made more friends. Next, they set off across North Africa.
They ran through Algeria and Libya, and stopped in Egypt to visit the pyramids. Then they turned and headed east, following the River Nile toEast Africa.
They ran through deserts and national parks. More young people joined them in Kampala, Uganda. The group ran into Kenya, and headed for its coast and the cityof Mombasa.
When they reached the sea, they sat onthe beach and atecoconut rice with fish. Juma said, "Let's take the unity torch to Mount Kilimanjaro, in Tanzania."
But by this time, Juma was very tired. Just as they left Kenya, he fell down. The runners stopped the race. Everyone came tohelp Juma.
Juma passed on the torch to Kadogo. He said, "You can carry the torch to Mount Kilimanjaro. Let'slight a flame for African unity."
After lighting a unity flame high on Kilimanjaro, the group of runners headed into southern Africa. People cheered the runners saying, "You are our heroes.We are together!"
They stopped to swim in Lake Malawi, and rest before going to the next country. Kadogo said to Juma, "We've run from farthest point in southern Africa to the farthest point in North Africa. Now we are in the south again. Our journey is ending."
The unity runners finally carried the torch to Great Zimbabwe, the ancient city of that country. Crowds gathered at this important place, cheering to welcome the tired runners."We did it!" said Kadogo. "What a race!" smiled Juma.

There lived an old man called Hagos. He lived with his three sons.Hagos wanted his sons to have wealth after his death. He prepared three boxes for them.
Hagos went to his neighbour Haile and said, "I want my sons to have wealth. I have prepared three boxes. I want you to give them the boxes after I die."
After Hagos died, Haile called the sons together.He told them, "Your father gave me these boxes before he died. You will each find your name on one of them. Take yours please."
The sons took the boxes and opened them.The first box had gold in it. The second box had soil. The third box had animal dung in it.
The one who found gold was very happy. The other two were not happy. They started quarrelling with him.
"You are brothers, you should not quarrel. Let me take you to a wise old man to advise you," said Haile to the three brothers.
Haile took the brothers to the wise old man. "Good morning, we have come to ask advice about inheritance," said Haile to the old man.
Haile told the wise old man about the three boxes that Hagos had left for his sons."Now they are quarrelling because only one received gold," explained Haile.
The wise old man asserted, "Your father had a reason for giving each of you a particular box."
He continued, "The one who received gold, your father wants you to be a merchant. The one who received soil, your father wants you to be a farmer."
"The one who received animal dung, your father wants you to be a cowboy. Your father wanted you each to have his own profession," the old man concluded.
After they listened to the old man's advice the three brothers agreed. They worked in their professions and lived happily.

One day, mama bought different fruits.
"When can we have some fruit?" we asked. "We will eat the fruit tonight," said mama.
My brother Rahim is greedy. He tasted all the fruit. He ate a lot of it.
"Look at what Rahim did!" shouted my little brother. "Rahim is naughty and selfish," I said.
Mama was angry with Rahim.
We were also angry with Rahim. But Rahim was not sorry.
"Are you going to punish Rahim?" asked little brother.
"Rahim, you will be sorry soon," warned mama.
Rahim started feeling unwell.
"My stomach is painful," whispered Rahim.
Mama knew why Rahim was sick. "The fruit is punishing Rahim," she thought.
Later, Rahim said sorry to us. "I will never be so greedy again," he promised. We believed him.
Many years ago, hyenas were starving. Because of a famine, even goats, sheep and cows migrated to other places. Hyenas had nothing to eat. They gathered in one place to discuss the issue.
One of the hyenas said, "In our culture, we eat anything that is fleeing. Look, these clouds are fleeing." This hyena believed that the clouds were migrating to another place. He said, "Let's eat them."
Immediately, all the hyenas looked up and saw the clouds moving in the sky. One of the youngest hyenas asked, "How do we reach the clouds? They are very far away from the ground."
The oldest hyena said, "Let the strongest hyena stand on the ground and then let the rest of us stand on each other's backs. We will climb on one another's backs until we reach the clouds."
They agreed and started climbing up on one another's backs. Soon, there were no more hyenas left remaining on the ground except the strongest one.
After the last hyena climbed up, the hyena on the ground thought that the others had started eating. He asked, "Why don't you give me some of the food you're eating?"
However, the hyenas did not reach the clouds. They didn't find any food and so they had nothing to give to the strongest hyena standing on the ground.
The strongest hyena became impatient and moved to the left side. All the others came falling down to the right side. As a result, even today all hyenas limp on their right side.
The wind roars. It roars past our home.
The wind is powerful. It tears my kite from my hand.
I run after my kite. The wind blows me away from the kite!
The wind becomes a storm. It carries my kite higher and higher.
The tornado swallows me up! I see nothing, I touch nothing.
Where is my kite now? Perhaps it is caught in a tree.
Perhaps my kite is still flying in the sky.
The wind finally dies down. I am still spinning.
When I stop spinning I look around. Where did the wind go?
I cannot see my kite anywhere. I cannot hear the wind anymore.
Perhaps tomorrow I will find my kite.
Now, I must go home, before the wind starts to roar again.
A crow was thirsty. He moved a very long distance in search for water for drinking but failed.
He then tried to fly back. To the tree where he was living. It took him a long time because he was weak.
As he was moving he saw water in a pot in someone's compound.
The water was almost at the bottom of the pot. His beak could not reach the water in the pot. He thought of a way to get that water.
An idea came to his mind. Hegot small stones He dropped one stone and the water in the pot jumped.
The crow put his mouth and drunk the water droplets.
He got another stone and repeated the exercise. He kept on doing this until he was satisfied.
This is cow. Cow is cool!
By day,  it is an ordinary cow.
Flying a kite.
Kicking a ball.
By night,  a supercow!
Saving lives.
And fighting crime.
But if you close your eyes really tight,  and make a wish.
Cow might come to visit you too!
The end.
In the olden days, Thunder and Lightning lived on earth amongst people.
Thunder was the mother of Lightning.
Lightning was hot tempered and he often got into arguments.
Whenever Lightning was angry he used to go around burning houses and knocking down trees.He made a frightening noise, "Pia-la-la-la, pia-la-la-la!" He damaged farms, and even sometimes killed people.
Whenever Lightning did these things, his mother would call out to him in a very loud voice, "Bumrambo- la-la-la, la-bum!" She tried to make him stop causing damage.
But Lightning did not care about what his mother said.He would cause problems for everyone when he was in a bad temper.
At last, people complained to the king.
So the king ordered that Thunder and her son should leave the village.He sent them to live far away from people's houses.
This did not do much good. When Lightning was angry he still burnt forests, "Pia-la-la-la, pia-la-la-la!" The flames sometimes spread to farms and burned them.
So people complained to the king again.
This time, the king told Lightning and Thunder that they could nolonger live on earth.He sent them to live in the sky, where they could not cause as much damage.
Ever since then, when Lightning is angry, he still manages to burn and destroy, "Pia-la-la-la, pia-lala- la!" And we still hear his mother, Thunder, scolding him, "Bumrambo- la-la-la, la-bum!"
Crickets chirp.
Mice squeak.
Snakes hiss.
Dogs bark.
Goats bleat.
Cows moo.
Lions roar.
And snails make no sound at all.
Babies babble.
And children talk.

In a village on the slopes of Mount Kenya in East Africa,  a little girl worked in the fields with her mother. Her name was Wangari.
Wangari loved being outside. In her family's food garden she broke up the soil with her machete. She pressed tiny seeds into the warm earth.
Her favourite time of day was just after sunset. When it got too dark to see the plants,  Wangari knew it was time to go home. She would follow the narrow paths through the fields,  crossing rivers as she went.
Wangari was a clever child and couldn't wait to go to school. But her mother and father wanted her to stay and help them at home. When she was seven years old,  her big brother persuaded her parents to let her go to school.
She liked to learn! Wangari learnt more and more with every book she read. She did so well at school that she was invited to study in the United States of America. Wangari was excited! She wanted to know more about the world.
At the American university Wangari learnt many new things. She studied plants and how they grow. And she remembered how she grew: playing games with her brothers in the shade of the trees in the beautiful Kenyan forests.
The more she learnt,  the more she realised that she loved the people of Kenya. She wanted them to be happy and free. The more she learnt,  the more she remembered her African home.
When she had finished her studies,  she returned to Kenya. But her country had changed. Huge farms stretched across the land. Women had no wood to make cooking fires. The people were poor and the children were hungry.
Wangari knew what to do. She taught the women how to plant trees from seeds. The women sold the trees and used the money to look after their families. The women were very happy. Wangari had helped them to feel powerful and strong.
As time passed,  the new trees grew into forests,  and the rivers started flowing again. Wangari's message spread across Africa. Today,  millions of trees have grown from Wangari's seeds.
Wangari had worked hard. People all over the world took notice,  and gave her a famous prize. It is called the Nobel Peace Prize,  and she was the first African woman ever to receive it.
Wangari died in 2011,  but we can think of her every time we see a beautiful tree.

Tom carries a tray of ripe bananas.
Tom goes to the market to sell bananas.
People at the market are buying fruit.
But no one is buying Tom's bananas. They prefer to buy fruit from women.
"In our community,  only women sell fruit," people say. "What kind of a man is this?" people ask.
But Tom does not give up. He calls,  "Buy my bananas! Buy my sweet ripe bananas!"
One woman picks up a bunch of bananas from the tray. She looks at the bananas carefully.
The woman buys the bananas.
More people come to the stall. They buy Tom's bananas and eat them.
Soon,  the tray is empty. Tom counts the money he earned.
Then Tom buys soap,  sugar,  and bread. He puts the things in his tray.
Tom balances the tray on his head and goes home.
Long ago, Thunder and Lightning lived on earth among people.
Thunder was the mother of Lightning.
Lightning had a bad temper.
When Lightning was angry, he destroyed people, houses and trees.
When Lightning caused such damage, Thunder made a loud noise.
Lightning did not pay attention to his mother.
At last,  people complained to the king.
The king sent Thunder and Lightning to live far away.
Lightning still burnt forests and crops when he was angry.
So people complained to the king again.
The king sent Thunder and Lightning to live in the sky.
But Lightning still burns and destroys when he is angry.
My village had many problems. We made a long line to fetch water from one tap.
We waited for food donated by others.
We locked our houses early because of thieves.
Many children dropped out of school.
Young girls worked as maids in other villages.
Young boys roamed around the village while others worked on people's farms.
When the wind blew,  waste paper hung on trees and fences.
People were cut by broken glass that was thrown carelessly.
Then one day,  the tap dried up and our containers were empty.
My father walked from house to house asking people to attend a village meeting.
People gathered under a big tree and listened.
My father stood up and said,  "We need to work together to solve our problems."
Eight-year-old Aminu,  sitting on a tree trunk shouted,  "I can help with cleaning up."
One woman said,  "The women can join me to grow food."
Another man stood up and said,  "The men will dig a well."
We all shouted with one voice,  "We must change our lives." From that day we worked together to solve our problems.
My heart feels a lot of things.
I feel happy when my granny tells us stories in the evening.
I feel silly when I play with my friend.
I feel bad when my dad says he does not have money.
I feel loved when my mom gives me a hug.
Once upon a time there was a husband and wife with children. The mother prepared food for the family each day. She would bring the meal to the table for them to eat.
The father would divide the meat. He would say to the eldest child, "I am old enough for meat. Here is yours. Wait until you are older."
Then he would say to the next child, "I am old enough for meat. Here is yours. Wait until you are older." Each small portion became even smaller.  It went like this for all the children. The youngest child got a tiny piece of meat.
The father kept the big pieces of meat for himself and his wife. The children were quiet and ate their food.
Years passed and the children grew up. The parents grew old. They became weak. The children looked after their old mother and father.
One day at meal time, the eldest child served the meat,  as usual. But this time she gave only a tiny piece to her father and a tiny piece to her mother.
She said to her parents, "You ate yours, now it is our time. We are old enough."  She served most of the meat to her brothers and sisters.
The father remembered what he did while his children were young. Mother and father agreed that it was not the right thing to do. They asked for forgiveness. The children promised that they would not repeat this mistake with their own children.
I wake up and make fire.
I boil some water.
I chop the firewood.
I stir the pot.
I sweep the floor.
I wash the dishes.
When my brother is busy playing!
Elephant and Hare were good friends.
They found grass and water for their animals.
They liked to play football.
Elephant scored more goals. Hare was not happy.
Hare asked Elephant, "What makes you a good player?" "My big legs."
Hare and Elephant ran a race. Hare won.
Elephant asked Hare, "What makes you a good runner?" "My thin legs."
Elephant asked, "How can I get thin legs?" "I will show you how."
Hare said, "Stand in the fire." Elephant did. He cried, "I am burning!"
Hare told Elephant, "This is the only way your legs can become thin."
Elephant moved out of the fire. He lay down.
For many days, Elephant was not able to stand.
When he was better, he walked home to his family.
Hare was very sorry. He asked Elephant to forgive him.
Adun was very beautiful. All the men in her village wanted to marry her. But Adun refused them all.
One market day,  a man borrowed legs from another man,  and arms from another,  and a body from a third man. Then this man joined all the parts together. He put his head on top and went to the market.
This man wanted Adun and was determined to marry her. Adun was pleased by his appearance. She wanted to be with him. The man came from a far town,  and Adun decided to return with him.
As Adun and the man journeyed to his place,  the owner of the legs took the legs back. Then the owner of the arms took his arms back. And finally the owner of the body took that back.
Only the head was left,  and the head went on. Adun was scared but she did not run away. They arrived at the house of the head.
The following morning,  before the head went to his farm,  he spoke to Tortoise. "If Adun tries to escape,  blow this horn to tell me," said the head.
After the head left,  Adun packed her things. Then she began to run away.
Seeing her,  Tortoise blew the horn,  "Head,  head,  Adun is about to run away," puffed Tortoise.
The head went up to Adun and said,  "Where do you think you are going?" Adun went back to the head's house.
Eventually Adun consulted a diviner about what to do. The diviner advised,  "Go and buy some bean cakes. Soak them in palm oil and put them in Tortoise's horn."
Adun followed the diviner's instructions. She put the oily cakes into the horn.
The following day,  she took her things and began to run away again. When Tortoise took the horn to blow it,  the delicious bean cakes fell into his mouth.
Tortoise ate,  ate and ate. And Adun ran away.

There was once an old woman living by herself inside a bottle. She complained all the time.
One day a fairy passed by her home and saw her looking very sad.
The fairy stopped and asked her, "What is the problem? Why are you so sad?"
"I am tired of living in a bottle," replied the old lady.
The fairy said to her, "Stand up, clap your hands twice, and turn around three times."
After doing what she was told to do, the old woman found herself in a small house.
After a few days the fairy came back and found the woman still unhappy.
The fairy asked her, "What is wrong now? Why are you sad?"
"This house is too small. I do not like it," responded the old woman.
The fairy said to her, "Stand up, clap your hands twice, and turn around three times."
After doing what she was told to do, the old woman found herself in a big house.
The fairy came to see the old woman again. She found her still unhappy and grumpy.
The fairy asked her, "What is wrong old lady?" The old lady responded, "This house is dark and dirty."
The fairy said to her, "Stand up, clap your hands twice, and turn around three times."
After doing what she was told to do, the old woman found herself back inside the bottle.
The old woman could not see the blessings she received. She ended up in her bottle, alone and unhappy.

When weboarded the plane, my son took out his puzzle book and saidto me, “Papa, let’s play ‘connecting the dots’.”“No beta”, I tried to explain, “You know Papabuilds biiiiiig buildings....for that he has to work on his laptop even duringvacation. But I have a surprise for you. Today, I’llshow you the tallest building I havebuilt – myaward winning project.”As the plane took off I exclaimed, ““Look son, that one is the city tower and just next to it is my dream project. I know we have boarded an early flight and so it is pretty dark outside but if you see carefully, you can locate it.”
Disappointed,he said,“Oh that small dot....because of THAT you missed my school project exhibition....I won first prize Papa....I wanted you to be there...”. Shockedby this reaction, I kept  staring athim, simultaneously trying hardto remember what the school projectwas. When I looked back out of the window, the dot...er...the building hadvanished as the plane had soared high.Aghast, I keptlooking out and thinking.
I realized that for pastmany months, I had kept feeling that I was missing something but couldn’tpinpoint it. But now at36000 feet above the ground, it dawned on me. I didn’t want to miss the‘sun’rise. Suddenly, the sky seemed clear of anyclouds. “Beta”, I called softly, ‘Let’s do theconnecting dots puzzle.” His face lit up. Grinning, he asked, “but what aboutyour dot I mean your work?” Holding his hand tightly I replied, “That canwait.....I have to connect some more important dots first....”
A long time ago,  there was a greedy Hyena.
There was also Tortoise. Hyena and Tortoise were friends.
Hyena told Tortoise,  "Let us search for honey."
Hyena ran fast. Tortoise followed slowly. He was afraid.
They crossed a river. They got wet.
Then they saw beehives. Hyena ran to the hives.
Hyena told Tortoise,  "Climb up and get the beehive."
Tortoise climbed slowly. Hyena was angry. He shouted at Tortoise.
Tortoise touched the beehive. Bees swarmed in the air.
Tortoise fell. The beehive fell on him. Hyena licked the honey.
The bees stung Hyena. He ran. The bees followed him.
Hyena ran into the river. The bees still followed him.
The beehive and the honey dried on Tortoise's back.
Tortoise got a shell to protect himself. He went home.
The stings caused patches on Hyena's body.
Long time ago,  there were two young men who lost their cows. They looked for the cows until it was late.
As it got dark,  they saw a light in a house. They agreed to go and ask for a place to sleep.
They went to the house and knocked. The door opened and they went in. The young men didn't see anyone. But they heard a voice greeting them.
The voice said,  "I am a louse. Open the metal pot and have food. Open the earthenware pot and drink amahewu."
Then the louse put on its skin and went out.
The young men ate,  drank,  and gave thanks. Then they left the house.
As they left,  they had a bad thought. They said,  "No,  it couldn't have happened that we had food from a louse."  Eventually they agreed to go back and crush the louse.
They went back to the house and crushed the louse. Suddenly the louse was gone,  and the house disappeared! They found themselves outside in the open.
Chat was born blind. Her eyes had never seen her parents, or her brothers and sisters. She knew their faces by touch.
One day, Chat was strolling in the garden. She liked the sweet scent of flowers. She loved to touch their soft petals.
Chat wished she could see flowers, just once. "They are lovely," she said to herself.
Every day, Chat walked in the garden. She knew her way around. Today, she raised her head to the skies.
Suddenly, she heard thunder and lightning. "I need to hurry back to the house," Chat thought.
Rain began to fall. Chat slipped, lost her balance and fell. She hit her head on a stone.
When Chat woke up, there were people around her. "What happened?" she asked.
"You fell and bumped your head," her father said. "Thank God you are fine," said her mother.
"Daddy, mummy?" asked Chat. She also called the names of her brothers and sisters. "Please, get me a flower."Everyone was surprised.
Her sister returned with a flower. Chat held it gently. "It is so lovely," she said.
Her family looked at one another. "Chat, can you see the flower?" her mother asked.
Chat played with the flower in her hand. "You are all so beautiful, just like this flower," she smiled.
Ostrich and Lioness were once good friends.
Unlike Lioness, Ostrich fed her chicks well.

There was a spider called Anansi. Anansi was too lazy to cook his own food. Instead, he used to visit his friends and eat the delicious food they had cooked.
One day, Anansi was passing Rabbit's house when he smelled green vegetables cooking. He was very excited. Rabbit said to Anansi, “They're not quite ready yet. You can help me to wash up while we wait.” Anansi replied, “Sorry, I have things to do. I'll come back later.”
“How will I call you when they're ready?” asked Rabbit. Anansi thought for a minute. “I'll spin a web,” he said. “I'll tie one end around my leg and one end to your pot. When the greens are ready, pull on the web string. I'll come right away.” So Anansi tied the web to the pot, and walked on.
Anansi saw Monkey and his wife, cooking beans in a large pot. “Come and join us! The beans are nearly ready.” Monkey said. Anansi replied, “Sorry, I have things to do. Let me tie one end of this web around my leg and one end to your pot. When the beans are ready, pull on the web string, and I'll come.”
As Anansi walked by Warthog's house, he smelled sweet potatoes. Warthog told Anansi, “My pot is full of sweet potatoes and honey! Come and share my food with me. Take this fork and help me to stir it.” Anansi replied, “I'll come back later. Let me tie one end of this web around my leg and one end to your pot. When the sweet potatoes areready, pull on the web string, and I'll come.”
By the time Anansi arrived at the river, each of his eight legs was tied to a pot of delicious food. Then, Anansi felt a pull on one of his legs. “Rabbit's food is ready!” Anansi thought, licking his lips.
He felt a second pull. And a third. And a fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth pull. Everyone was pulling on the web strings at the same time! “Stop! Stop!” he cried in pain, as his legs were stretched thinner and thinner. But no one could hear him.
Finally, the web strings could hold no longer. They snapped, one by one. Anansi rolled into the river to soothe his painful legs. But his legs would not return to their normal shape. Anansi was too embarrassed to go to any of his friends that day.

Once up on a time, there were two friends. The one was clever, the other was stupid. The stupid man's wife was clever. The clever man's wife was stupid.
While they were chatting, the clever man said, "Your wife is clever, but you are stupid. My wife is also stupid, so she might be more compatible with you."
The stupid man asked, "Between me and you, who is stupider?" Then he said, "I am as clever as you are." "If so, let's go to a judge and I will ask you a question," replied the clever man. They agreed to go.
In front of the judge, the clever man asked, "How many stars are there in the sky? Where is the centre of the world? Answer both questions, or we will swap our wives." The judge allowed some time for the stupid man to return with the answers.
One night, the stupid man was counting the stars, sitting on the roof of his house. "What are you doing?" his wife asked him.
He replied, "My friend asked me how many stars there are in the sky, and where the centre of the earth is. Now I'm counting the stars."
"Don't worry, I will tell you the answers," said his wife. She gave her husband a sack of grain. She said, "If they ask you how many stars are in the sky, tell them it is the same as the number of grains in the sack."
Then she gave him a stick and said, "If they ask you where the centre of the world is, push the stick into the ground and tell them it is in the centre. If they complain, tell them to measure it."
The stupid man arrived with his wife's advice. First he answered, "The number of stars is the same as the number of grains in this sack." Then he pushed the stick into the ground and said, "This is the centre of the earth."
The judge was amused and asked, "Who told you this?" The stupid man replied, "My wife."    The judge continued, "Your wife is very clever, so she should be with a clever man. You will swap your wives."  Then, the judge set an appointment to swap their wives.
The stupid man told his wife, "I won, but the judge said that you are clever, and don't deserve to be with me." His wife replied, "Don't worry I have a solution to this too."
The time came for the judge to swap the wives. The clever wife gave the judge a saucepan of food as a gift. When the judge opened the saucepan, he saw a roasted chicken still with all its feathers! Shocked, he muttered, "Oh, I see, so she belongs with her stupid husband afterall!"
It is hot sunny Saturday morning on the farm. Maya, Duksie and Doobie are helping Mama K in her vegetable garden. The children work all morning. They dig compost into the soil. They weed and water. Then they harvest what is ripe and ready. Today each of the children will take home freshly picked strawberries, spinach and carrots.
Mama K always gives the children a treat for helping her. Sometimes its cake or chocolate, or she buys longsweets that look like snakes. Sometimes it's apples, pears or oranges. Mama K has only one rule. “Share it fair!” The children know they must share the treats equally, so they all get the same amount.
Today Mama K has baked a round strawberry cake with pink icing and berries from her garden. The childrenwait on the grass for their treat. “Here you go!” smiles Mama K. “But remember the rule. Everyone must get the same. Share it fair! Don't fight!”
Maya has the first turn to share the cake. She uses the knife to trace lines in the icing. The others watch her. She does not cut the cake yet. The others must first agree if her way is fair. “I think I will make two cuts down like this. Now we have three slices, all the same!” Maya shows them.
“No way!” says Duksie, “the one in the middle is much too big!” Doobie also shakes his head. Maya laughs and shrugs and tells Duksie to try.
“Here! Pass me the knife, I'll do it. Easy peasy!” chants Duksie. First she rubs out Maya's pattern in the icing and licks her fingers.
Then she makes one cut across and one down. “Look, I made my three slices!” “That's not fair!” shout Mayaand Doobie together.
“Share it fair! The pieces must be the same size and shape,” adds Doobie. “Why don't you try Doobie, SmartyPants?” smirks Duksie. “I bet you can't do it!”
“I wish the cake was a square or a rectangle, and then it would be easy!” says Doobie thoughtfully. “Or, if there were four of us to share the round cake that would also be easy,” says Maya.
And then! A picture comes into Doobie's head. He sees the sparkling silver badge at the front of his father's big red truck. On Sundays he helps his dad to wash the truck, and to polish the shiny badge. “I've got it! I've got it!I know how to do it,” yells Doobie.
“You are full of surprises, Doobie,” says Duksie sweetly. “How did you work it out?” Maya asks. Doobie smiles to himself. For now it his secret. Later, he will tell his dad.
First he uses a knife to smooth Duksie's lines in the icing. Then he traces three lines on the cake. It looksjust like the badge on his dad's truck, with three equal parts.
Just then Mama K comes out of her house. She is carrying a tray with three glasses of cold strawberry juice. “Look Mama K! Doobie found the way to cut the cake into three equal pieces,” Maya tells her. “Well done Doobie,three equal slices! You shared fairly, I'm proud of you all. Now cut the cake and drink your juice. It's time to go home. I will give you plates to take your pieces of cake.”
Maya cuts along Doobie's lines to make three equal slices. Just for fun, the children stack the slices on top of each other to check that they are the same size. Yes they are!
Doobie's dad arrives to pick up the children, and Doobie runs off to meet him. He can't wait to tell his dad how the badge on the truck helped him to solve a very tricky problem!

My name is Kobole. I live in a small village.
One day, I was out picking fruits. I saw something I had never seen before.
There were colourful lines in the sky.
I dropped all the fruit and ran to tell people at home.
People were standing outside surprised.
I said happily, "It is a beautiful sheet hanging from the sky." "No! I think someone is pouring paint from the sky," Neno said.
Some people agreed with me. Others thought Neno was right. We began to argue.
A man from a faraway village said, "You are all wrong."
We shouted, "Tell us then what it is if we are wrong."
The stranger said, "It is the rainbow. Have you never seen the rainbow before?"
We asked the stranger, "Rainbow? What is a r-a-i-n-b-o-w?"
Neno asked, "Is it ours? Can we keep it here?" We never got answers to our questions because the man had left.
There was only one bus in Ebei's village. It was big and blue. It was very noisy.
“Tomorrow we will go to town,” said Ebei's mother. “We will buy your school uniform.”
Ebei was very excited. They would travel in the big blue bus. He could not sleep that night.
When his mother came to wake him, Ebei was already dressed.
Ebei and his mother walked to the bus stop. They waited for the big blue bus. But the bus did not come.
Other people arrived at the bus stop. They complained because the bus was late. “Where is the bus?” they asked.
Ebei was worried. “We will not be able to go to town,” he thought. “I will not be able to get my uniform.”
Some people gave up and went home. Ebei cried. He did not want to go. “We will wait a bit longer,” said his mother.
Suddenly, they heard a noise. They saw dust in the air. The bus was coming!
But this bus was not blue. It was not big. It was red and small. The people did not want to get in this bus.
“Get in! Get in!” shouted the driver. “We are very late today,” he called.
Ebei and his mother got in first. Soon everyone else got in the small red bus.
Ebei looked out the window. He saw more people at the bus stop.
Even more people were running to catch the bus. But they were too late. The red bus was full. It left for town.
“Where is the big blue bus?” asked Ebei's mother. “It broke down,” replied the driver. “We are fixing it. It will come tomorrow.”
Ebei did not care about the colour of the bus. He did not care about the size. This bus was going to town!

Kadogo and Juma are friends who love running. They run together every day.
One day they were reading maps at school. Juma said, "Let's run across our continent. Let's race, together with Africans from many countries!" "Let's go, we can do it! African unity!" cheered Kadogo.
They decided to carry a unity torch on their journey. They lit the torch and began to run.The race started at the southern tip of our continent, in Cape Town, South Africa.
From South Africa they headed along the west coast. They ran through Namibia, Angola, DRC, Congo and Cameroon. Runners quickly joined them from these countries.The growing group of people rested in Nigeria, in Abuja.
More runners from West Africa joined the friends as they passed through Nigeria. They continued together, following the River Niger.
A sandstorm in Mali made it difficult to run. Juma was the strongest of all of them. He led the way safely, holding the unity torch high.
At Guinea's coast in Conakry the dusty runners washed in the sea. Then they decided to race to Morocco through Senegal and Mauritania.All the way, more people joined them.
At Casablanca, the runners enjoyed playing on the beaches. They made more friends.Next, they set off across North Africa.
They ran through Algeria and Libya, and stopped in Egypt to visit the pyramids. Then they turned and headed east,  following the River Nile to East Africa.
They ran through deserts and national parks. More young people joined them in Kampala, Uganda. The group ran into Kenya, and headed for its coast and the city of Mombasa.
When they reached the sea, they sat on the beach and ate coconut rice with fish. Juma said, "Let's take the unity torch to Mount Kilimanjaro, in Tanzania."
But by this time, Juma was very tired. Just as they left Kenya, he fell down. The runners stopped the race. Everyone came to help Juma.
Juma passed on the torch to Kadogo. He said, "You can carry the torch to Mount Kilimanjaro. Let's light a flame for African unity."
After lighting a unity flame high on Kilimanjaro, the group of runners headed into southern Africa.People cheered the runners saying, "You are our heroes. We are together!"
They stopped to swim in Lake Malawi, and rest before going to the next country. Kadogo said to Juma, "We've run from farthest point in southern Africa to the farthest point in North Africa. Now we are in the south again. Our journey is ending."
The unity runners finally carried the torch to Great Zimbabwe, the ancient city of that country. Crowds gathered at this important place, cheering to welcome the tired runners."We did it!" said Kadogo. "What a race!" smiled Juma.
In a village there was a disagreement among people of different occupations. Everyone thought their work was the most important!
The teacher said that he had the most important occupation. “Without teachers you could not go to school and learn.”
The builder said that he had the most important occupation. “Without builders you would not have schools to learn in or houses to sleep in.”
The carpenter said that he had the most important occupation. “Without carpenters you would have no furniture for your houses and schools.”
The doctor claimed that he had the most important occupation. “Without doctors and nurses you could get sick and die.”
The farmer said that she had the most important occupation. “Without farmers you would not have food to eat.”
The student argued that students had the most important work. “Without students, there would be no teachers, builders, doctors, farmers, or carpenters.”
Eventually everyone agreed that all the occupations are important. We need teachers, builders, doctors, farmers, and carpenters. But everyone has to be a student first!

One day, Apiyo, Ajoh and Atieno went to fetch firewood. Grandmother said, “Be careful of Lego. Fetch firewood only.” Ajoh did not pay attention.
The girls packed some food, ropes and a sharp machete. Apiyo said, “I am the oldest, so you must listen to me.”
They talked and laughed as they walked. Suddenly, Apiyo said, “Be quiet. We are near where Lego lives.”
Atieno said, “These are Lego's golden teeth. Let us take them.” Apiyo reminded them, “Remember what grandmother told us. We must fetch only firewood.”
“Grandmother does not know anything. I will take the golden teeth,” saidAjoh. Apiyo and Atieno were not happy.
Lego came looking for his golden teeth. They were not there. Lego thought, “The one who took my teeth will know who I am!”
On their way home, the girls heard, “Hzzzzzzzz!” Lego was there with his mouth wide open, ready to swallow.
Lego asked, “Who took my golden teeth?” No one answered. Lego said, “The innocent girl will sing well. The thief will not.”
Apiyo sang: It's not me! It's not me who took the teeth! The one who took is near!Atieno also sang well.
Ajoh sang badly and the words did not come out. Lego shouted, “Sing like the others.” Lego knew that Ajoh took his golden teeth.
Lego swallowed Ajoh. Her sisters ran home to say what happened. The girls' grandmother said sadly, “I warned them, if only Ajohhad listened.”
There lived a hunter who survived by trapping wild animals. For many days he did not trap any single animal. His family began to starve. Hunting was their main source of food.
One morning he went to check his traps in the forest. He was lucky that day, one of his traps had caught a giraffe.
He got very happy when he saw the giraffe. He celebrated that his family will get food. He said, "Let me carefully get the giraffe without losing much of its blood."
"Let me cut the ankle tendons so that there is little blood."
He crept slowly, with his spear aimed at the ankle tendons. To his disappointment, he missed the target. The spear cut the trap!
The giraffe jumped and before it could get away, the hunter grabbed the tail. He was dragged away.
He was dragged through the forest. He finally let go of the tail. He was left bruised in the thorny bushes.
He struggled his way out of the thorny bush with injuries and went home miserably. His greed and foolishness had denied him food!
Peace is very important thing in our daily life.
whoever does not have peace does not plan or do anything right.
If you don't have peace, you lose the living hope and you feel that whatever you do yields nothing.
Peace is the root of living hope, wealthy and sustainable development.
A family with peace is so strong that nothing can demolish or divide its members.
Friends with peace love each other a true love and they live without any disruption.
A country with peace does not have wars and what the citizens will, they gather their force and earn it.
May peace be with you all!

Chicken and Millipede were very close friends. In some ways they were very similar; they both loved sport and were very competitive. But in other ways they were very different. Millipede loved to joke around and make people laugh. She was able to do many things at once, juggling tasks with her many legs. Chicken was more serious. She was good at taking others under her wing and making them feel safe and cared for. But she also had a terrible temper!
One day they decided to play a friendly game of soccer. Chicken was a fast runner and an excellent dribbler. She also had a powerful kick and could score goals from far away. But Millipede had something Chicken could never compete with - hundreds of legs! Millipede ran circles around poor Chicken, scoring goal after goal. Chicken got angrier and angrier. Watch out, Millipede!
"Let's have a penalty shoot-out," said Chicken, hoping that this would prevent Millipede from using her legs to dribble around her."Sure thing!" said Millipede confidently.First Millipede was goal keeper. Chicken scored only one goal. Then it was Chicken's turn to defend the goal.
Millipede kicked the ball and scored. Millipede juggled the ball and scored. Millipede headed the ball and scored. Millipede tapped the ball and scored.Chicken grew angrier by the minute. "This is unfair," she thought, "Millipede should only be able to use two of her legs. She is cheating!"While Chicken was busy thinking her angry thoughts, Millipede slyly kicked the ball around her and through the goalposts. Millipede scored five goals!
Chicken was furious that she had lost."I want a rematch," she demanded, "and this time you can only use two of your legs!"Millipede started laughing because her friend was making such a fuss. "What a sore loser you are!" she said, "Why didn't you use your wings to flap the ball into the goal, or your feathers to blow it over my head? You lost fair and square, my friend!"
"You see," said Millipede, "soccer is really all about strategy. You need to use your brain and have a plan.""Are you telling me I don't have any brains?" shrieked Chicken. "How dare you!"But before Millipede could answer, Chicken opened up her beak and swallowed her.
As Chicken was walking home, she met Mother Millipede. Usually Chicken loved to see her friend's mother. Mother Millipede told wonderful stories and baked the most delicious leaf cakes. But today Chicken marched right on, hoping Mother Millipede would not recognize her."Hello dear," Mother Millipede called, “Have you seen my child?” Chicken didn't say anything. Mother Millipede was worried. "Chicken is acting very strangely!" she thought.
Then Mother Millipede heard a tiny voice. “Help me, Mom!” cried the voice. Mother Millipede looked  around and listened carefully. "Where is that voice coming from?" she asked. "Have you got someone inside your stomach, Chicken?"Chicken looked around sheepishly. She didn't know what to do."Who have you eaten?" asked Mother Millipede. "Don't tell me you've eaten my precious baby!"
Mother Millipede shouted, “Use your special power my child!”Millipedes can make a badsmell and a terrible taste. Chicken began to feel ill."I don't feel so well," she moaned. "I need to go home and lie in my bed."
Chicken burped. Then she swallowed and spat. Then she sneezed and coughed.  Millipede tasted disgusting!Meanwhile, Mother Millipede stood beside her, cheering. "Well done, my darling!" she shouted, "Keep on working that special magic! You'll be out in no time."
Chicken coughed and coughed until Millipede came out. "Hooray!" shouted Millipede, "I'm free! I escaped!"Mother Millipede was relieved to see her child alive and well. "Come quickly," she whispered, and her and Millipede crawled quickly away. They climbed and climbed until they reached the top of a tall tree where they could hide.
From that time on, all chickens and millipedes have been enemies.
There was a husband and wife with two daughters. They lived happily until one day the mother died. The man married again. His new wife did not get along with his daughters. The man was confused. He loved his daughters but he also loved his new wife.
In the end he decided to send away his daughters. He took them on a journey. When they reached a big tree, they sat under it to rest. He said to them, "My daughters wait for me here until I return."
While in the bush, the man cut off his finger nails. He said, "My nails, I am abandoning my daughters. When they call for me, respond to them."The girls waited under the tree for their father, but he did not return.
They called, "Father! Father! Where are you?" A voice responded, "I am coming! I am coming!" It was the man's nails.They searched in the direction of the voice, but could not find their father. Finally, they realised he was not coming back.
The two girls returned to the tree and prayed loudly, "Creator of this tree, hear us." The tree split into pieces and became a nice house. Again the girls prayed, "God of fruits, feed us." Fruit dropped from the sky for them to eat.
Rather than thinking about their father, the daughters chose to live their lives as best they could They stayed in the house and ate only the fruit which dropped from the sky. But after a while they wanted to eat meat.
The girls knew that Hyena lived near their home. He kept many animals and ate meat every day. Eventually, they decided to go and steal meat from Hyena. So the older girl went alone to Hyena's house.
Hyena was sitting at his fire but the girl did not see him. He caught her and tied her up. Hyena decided to boil her for supper. He put the girl into a pot with water and lit the fire, and then he went out.
After a while, the younger girl began to wonder why her sister had not returned. She went to Hyena's house and saw her sister in the pot on the fire.She prayed, "God of pots, please don't let my sister die."
Immediately, the pot broke into pieces and the older sister fell out alive. The girls ran away before Hyena came back. When they arrived at their house they found many riches there.Many years passed and the sisters grew to women.
One day, a man wearing old and dirty clothes knocked on the sisters' door, asking for help. When the older sister looked at him, she was reminded of their father. She asked the man his name and where he came from.
When he finished explaining, the women knew that this old man was their father. They told him their part of the story.The man wept with joyful surprise. "Can you forgive me?" he asked. The sisters welcomed their father and invited him to stay. And in time, they forgave him.

Once upon a time, there was a man called Byantaka who had a cow. Each day Byantaka grazed his cow. He also gave the cow water to drink. But Byantaka only had a very small pot for water.
So he went at his neighbour's home to borrow a bigger pot for water. His neighbour agreed to lend Byantaka his biggest clay pot saying, "My neighbour's problem is my problem."
After a few days, Byantaka went to apotter's place and bought a small pot. He took it home. He put the small pot inside the big pot that he had borrowed from his neighbour.
Then he put the big pot, with the small pot inside it,on his head. He carried the big pot to the neighbour who loaned him the pot.
Byantaka told him, "I am returning your pot, it has reproduced." The neighbour was amazed that his pot had produced another pot. He praised Byantaka saying, "Your home is blessed."
After a while, Byantaka went back to his neighbour to borrow the pot again. He did not have good intentions.
The owner of the big pot waited in vain for Byantaka to return his pot. Eventually he went to Byantaka's home and said, "I have come for my pot."
Byantaka told his neighbour, "My friend, our pot died. I was just on my way to tell you the bad news."
His neighbour clapped his hands together in surprise. His face began to swell with anger. He shouted at Byantaka, "I have never heard of a pot dying!"
Byantaka replied, "My friend you should accept these things. Everything that produces must die. I was also very sorry about the big pot's death."
His neighbour was very angry and he went to court to report Byantaka. The judge listened to explanations from both of them. He found the owner of the pot was in the wrong.
"When Byantaka told you that the pot had reproduced, you accepted. When he says that every living thing which reproduces must die, he is correct." That is how the judge judged the case.
Byantaka's neighbour went home walking like a snail. Byantaka had got the big pot with his cleverness.
There was a time when all the animals lived together as friends. One day they decided to have a meeting to elect a king.
Rooster wanted to be king. So he lied to the other animals. He told them, “The red comb on my head is fire! Don't touch the comb on my head!”
The other animals believed Rooster. They decided to elect Rooster as their king. The animals hoped that Rooster's fire would help them in cold weather.
Then came a day when it rained. And rained. And rained. It was cold. Everything was wet and cold.
“Where can we get fire to warm our bodies?” Rabbit asked the other animals.
“We can get fire from the comb on Rooster's head,” replied Monkey. “Rooster is our king because he has fire on his head,” said Monkey.
The animals agreed with Monkey. They sent Fox to collect fire from king Rooster.
Fox found Rooster in a deep sleep. So he decided to take fire without asking Rooster.
Fox collected some dry grass. He put the grass next to the comb on Rooster's head. Nothing happened. The grass did not catch fire.
“Wake up king Rooster!” yelled Fox. “We need fire now.”
But Rooster could not give fire to Fox.
Fox was angry. He went back to the other animals. He told them the truth about the comb on Rooster's head. From that day, no one was afraid of Rooster. And foxes eat roosters and their families.
Ostrich and Lioness were great friends. Both of them had young ones.
Unlike the Lioness, the Ostrich fed her chicks well.
The Lioness' cubs had little food to eat.
The Lioness looked at the Ostrich's chicks and thought, “They are beautiful! I wish they were mine.”
One day, when the Ostrich was away, the Lioness took the chicks away to her home.
The Ostrich returned and found the cubs in her home instead.  “Where are my children?” she cried.
The Ostrich ran to the Lioness' hut and saw her chicks with Lioness.
The Lioness refused to let the Ostrich take her chicks. She said, “They are mine now. You can have the cubs.”
The Ostrich was angry and upset. “What can I do to get back my children?” she wondered to herself.
Then she thought, “I know what to do. I will call all the animals for a meeting.”
The animals gathered together.
Elephant asked the Ostrich and Lioness to speak.
Most of the animals were afraid to blame the Lioness.
Finally, Squirrel stood up and said, “Children that look like birds, belong to the Ostrich. Those with tails, belong to the Lioness.”
Then Squirrel disappeared into a hole. All the animals cheered.
Lioness was very annoyed. She went home with her cubs.
She carried me for nine months.
She made sure that I grew up healthy and strong.
She put me to bed every night.
She made sure that I woke up early every morning.
She took me shopping at the market.
And allowed me to choose my own shoes and clothes.
She counselled me whenever I went wrong.
I will never forget her love in my life.
Once upon a time there was a husband and wife with children.The mother prepared food for the family each day. She would bring the meal to the table for them to eat.
The father would divide the meat. He would say to the eldest child, "I am old enough for meat. Here is yours. Wait until you are older."
Then he would say to the next child, "I am old enough for meat. Here is yours. Wait until you are older."Each small portion became even smaller. It went like this for all the children. The youngest child got a tiny piece of meat.
The father kept the big pieces of meat for himself and his wife. The children were quiet and ate their food.
Years passed and the children grew up. The parents grew old. They became weak. The children looked after their old mother and father.
One day at meal time, the eldest child served the meat, as usual. But this time she gave only a tiny piece to her father and a tiny piece to her mother.
She said to her parents, "You ate yours, now it is our time. We are old enough."She served most of the meat to her brothers and sisters.
The father remembered what he did while his children were young. Mother and father agreed that it was not the right thing to do.They asked for forgiveness. The children promised that they would not repeat this mistake with their own children.
