It was a BIG, green, rubber frog!Shanti's eyes flew open. Then she opened her mouth to laugh.THEN Arun and her friends saw why she had not smiled or talked all day!Four of her front teeth had gone missing!
I wake up at night feeling thirsty. I want to get some water. I start looking for my slippers under the bed.
Oh my God! There is a tiger under my bed.
Now what should I do?
Should I call Ma? What if the tiger roars?
Should I just go back to sleep? But I am not sleepy any more.
Then someone turns on the light. Ma is standing at the door.
“What happened dear?Did you call me?” asks Ma.
I point towards the tiger. Ma bends and pulls the tiger out from under the bed!
Hey, this is no tiger. This is my thick yellow and black sweater. Its buttons shine like a tiger's eyes.
I got scared for nothing!Ma gets me some water.
Now I will sleep. And dream about real tigers in a jungle!
Summer is almost over. Mangoes will also get over.Hashim loves mangoes.He wants to keep the mangoes.How can he keep them for the whole year?
Baba says mangoes can stay the whole year. First we must dry them. "Germs die without water," he says."So dry mangoes do not go bad."
"How do we dry them?" asks Hashim."Add salt to them!" says Baba
Then Baba and Hashim add salt to the mangoes.They also spread them in the sun to dry.
When the mangoes are dry, they put them in a bottle. Then they add oil to it. Oil stops the air and the germs from reaching the mango.
"Baba, we have made pickle!" says Hashim.
How can we preserve our favourite fruits and vegetables?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          What are some other ways?
Potato slice + boil + dry = potato chips (to be fried and eaten)Any fruit + sugar + lemon + cook = jam
Tomato + salt + sun + oil = sun-dried tomatoesLemon + salt = lemon preserves

The judge told Monkey and Hyena to ask thevillage elders.
The elders also feared to pass judgement onMonkey or Hyena.
The elders told Monkey and Hyena, "The case isvery difficult."
They told Monkey and Hyena to ask the poor woman in the village.
The poor woman agreed to judge their case.
She said to Hyena, "You are big and respected. You are a hero."
Hyena said, "You are right. I will end this disagreement."
"Monkey, you are too clever to quarrel," she said.He agreed!
She said, "You both agreed to stop quarrelling.Forgive each other."
The poor woman solved the problem.
Ammu did not have a puppy.But she told everyone in school that she did.
"My puppy’s name is Simba," she told Venu."Simba eats bananas," she told Abdul."Simba is black," she told Kumari."Simba plays ball with me," she told Unni.
So Venu, Abdul, Kumari, and Unni told Ammu that they would come home.To see Simba. Ammu shook her head."You can’t," she said.
"Why?" they asked."Because Simba is scared of crowds," said Ammu."Then we’ll play with him one by one," said Kumari.
"You can’t," Ammu said."Why?" asked Unni."Because we’re going out today," said Ammu.
"Then we’ll come tomorrow," said Abdul."We’ll bring bananas for him," said Venu."We’ll play with him one by one," said Kumari."Okay," said Ammu.  She didn’t know what else to say.
That evening, Ammu asked Achan if he would buy a puppy for her."We’ll see," said Achan."But it’s urgent," said Ammu. Achan laughed. Ammu didn’t eat dinner. She felt sick.
She didn’t want to think about tomorrow.  In the morning, Amma said, "You look ill."She touched Ammu’s forehead. A fever!
"Stay at home today," Amma said.So Ammu skipped school.She lay in bed all day. She didn’t smile at all.All she ate was a slice of bread.
In the evening, Venu, Abdul, Kumari, and Unni came home."Why didn’t you come to school today?" asked Unni."I am sick," said Ammu.
"We saw Simba," said Abdul."Where?" asked Ammu."In the garden," said Kumari.
"He didn’t want to play ball," said Abdul.Suddenly, Ammu got up from bed. She ran outside.
It was true. There was a puppy in her garden. Simba!"But he’s not black," said Venu. "He’s brown.’""Oh," said Ammu. "I made that up!"
"He’s not afraid of crowds," said Abdul."Oh," said Ammu. "I made that up!"
"But he loves bananas," said Kumari."I told you, didn’t I?" smiled Ammu happily.
King Leopard was getting old. How will he choose the next king?

After the party, King Leopard spoke. The animals listened.
He said, "A contest will decided the next king."

Elephant only counted up to four. The spear fell.
Warthog pushed everyone saying, "I'm the strongest. I should be king."
Warthog counted up to six and the spear fell. He left.
Everyone said, "Big Elephant and Warthog failed. Who can win?"
Ape counted, "One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven!" He cried.
King Leopard said, "Ape, you only get one chance." Ape left.
Some animals started leaving. Then, Little Antelope said, "Let me try."

a warm morning , Raja woke up with a yawn and said to himself "lets go for fishing now".
While going to the pond,he met Ram,his best friend and invited him to go to the pond together.
Sita saw them going for fishing. The boys asked her if she wanted to come with them.
Sita thought for a moment and said "don't do this,fishes will die when separated by water"
They didn't paid attention to her and continued on their way to the pond.
Raja and Ram sat near the pond and saw to fishes jumping in water,one was a thin and second a fat one.
There came a third fish. They didn't saw any fish bigger than this! Sita said" This fish is even bigger than my father's foot!"
Raja and Ram took their fishing rods with and struggled for the fish.Ram said"its mine!"Raja said"no,its mine!"
Raja pulled the rod, Ram pulled stronger.
BOOM! They fell down as their rods broke.
Do you know why ?Any guesses ?fished tied their strings together!
I decided to name them Royalty and Blackie.
Royalty was brown and like a queen. Blackie was a lovely black dog with long hair.
I used to walk them everyday when I came from school.
Sometimes I would bath them by myself. Royalty would always run away!
Then, we moved and went to a flat. They didn't allow dogs there.
I found that Blackie was lost, and Royalty was lonely.  I felt very bad in my heart.
Once upon a time, there were four friends and they decided to do a toy race.

In a particular year, the dry season was too long and a drought hit hard. As a result, all the rivers dried up, except the River of Blessings. All the animals were thirsty and called for a meeting.
Camel was the first to speak, "As you know, we are very thirsty and all the rivers have dried up, except the River of Blessings. But it is very far away. What do we do?"
Horse suggested, "Some of us can go to the River of Blessings. We can drink and bring water for the others." Cow answered, "It is too far. By the time we returned from the river those left behind would be dead."
Sheep said, "Maa! Maaa! I will go to the River of Blessings and drink water." Goat jumped up and said, "Meee, meee! I will also go to the River of Blessings." Chicken said, "Keer, ker ker ker! I too will go to the River of Blessings.
All the animals wanted to go. Camel led the way. Going there was not easy. Guinea fowl was last in the line. "My friends, I can no longer go to the River of Blessings," he said.Chicken swallowed Guinea fowl.
They continued. Chicken said, "Please, I am tired, I no longer want to go to the River of Blessings." Sheep swallowed Chicken.
As the journey continued, Sheep also became tired. Sheep said, "I am tired. I do not want to go to the River of Blessings anymore." Goat swallowed Sheep.
Soon, Goat was too tired to continue going to the river. Horse turned and swallowed Goat. When Horse became too tired to go to the river, Cow swallowed him.
When Cow finally could not continue, Camel turned and swallowed her.
Being the only animal left, Camel did her best to reach the River of Blessings. Camel finally arrived, very tired.
On arrival, Camel lay down and vomited Cow. Cow vomited Horse. Horse vomited Goat. Goat vomited Sheep. Sheep vomited Chicken and Chicken vomited Guinea fowl.
And that is how all the animals managed to drink water from the River of Blessings.
All of us went to the Dasara fair.
Papa bought Chintu fancy glasses. Mother bought me a bright blue cap. The baby got sugar candy.
On the way home, a very strong wind came.It blew my cap away.
My cap got stuck on a branch of the old Pipal tree.
I cried a lot. And I did not eat my dinner.
Later that night, the moon came up.It looked at my cap on the old Pipal tree.
It tried on my cap. The moon smiled happily. I had to smile too.
After school the next day, my mother gave me a shiny new red cap. “The moon sent it,” she said.
That night, both the moon and I wore our caps and smiled. We were happy.
Do you think the sun needs a hat?
Guess which cap I am wearing today!
Priya hears a sound.Srrr... Srrr...  Who is it?

Parna was a tall, slender boy who was in Grade 3. He liked to wear the long black coat that his Uncle Teteyo gave him.
During holiday time, Parna looked after his parents' cows.
One day, as Parna looked after the cows, it suddenly started raining.
Just at that time, his father's favourite cow, Blackie, gave birth. The calf was the most beautiful calf that Parna had ever seen.
Parna was so happy caring for Blackie and the calf that he forgot about the rest of the cows.
He thought, "Father promised to give the calf to me if it is female."
As he daydreamed, a strong hand pulled him up. Parna saw Uncle Teteyo and remembered, "Uncle, where are the cows?"
Uncle Teteyo replied, "Your mother found all the cows in the shed, except Blackie, and you. She was afraid so she sent me to fetch you."
Parna excitedly told his uncle how Blackie gave birth to the beautiful calf. Uncle Teteyo said, "I'll carry the calf as you and Blackie follow."
Everyone was happy to see Parna, Blackie and the calf safe.
Parna asked his father, "Will you let me have the calf as you promised?"
"Yes, my son, she is all yours. A promise is a promise."

This isJadav, a tree-planter. He lovestree-places because they are full of life.No-tree-placesmake him terribly sad, because they are full of dead things.
Years ago,Jadav was walking along the banks of the great Brahmaputra River whenhe arrived at a big, empty no-tree-place.It was dryand hot. The sand was powdery and striped.
Stripedsand? How odd.Jadav wentcloser to take a better look.Oh, butthey weren't stripes at all! The ground was covered in snakes!Lastnight’s floods must have washed them ashore, Jadav thought.
Thesesnakes weren't slinking and slithering and swaying about likeregular, healthy snakes. When Jadav walked among them, they didn'thiss or run away or try to bite him. They just lay about like oldropes, tired and still."Poorsnakes! They're dying from the heat! If only they had some shade tolie in! If only this no-tree-place had some trees in it!"
Jadavcouldn't bear to watch the snakes die. It made him so terribly sadthat he sat down and began to cry.But hequickly came to his senses. "No more crying. From now on: onlytrying!"He jumpedup, ran back to his village and began collecting all the bambooshoots he could carry in his bag. "Regular plants won't grow inthe hot sand, but bamboo will. Bamboo is strong!"
Jadavbrought the shoots to the no-tree-place and started planting themeverywhere. It was hard, hot work, and it took years.The rivergrew thin one summer and flooded the next, sometimes bringing moresand and sometimes taking it away. Heavy rains came and went. ButJadav kept on planting.
In time,the bamboo took root and began to grow. As it grew, it brought shade,and the shade brought insects.The insectsburrowed into the ground, and the earth below the bamboo trees beganto change. The dry and white became rich and brown, and the dead sandbecame living soil.
Jadav wasno longer sad. But he wasn't happy either.He lookedaround his bamboo grove and thought, "A few-trees-place is nice,I know. But how wonderful it would be if this were amany-trees-place!" The idea thrilled him.So Jadavwent back to his village and began collecting many more seeds andsaplings. He filled three big bags with Arjun and ejar and gulmoharand koroi and moj and himolu. "Now that our few-trees-place haslovely brown soil, we can plant all these and more!"
Jadavbrought his new saplings and seeds to the few-trees-place and plantedthem all around.It was hardwork, his back hurt, and it took many years. The orange and blueskies turned purple and pink, and villages became towns. The windgrew laden with dust, and the river became grey. But Jadav's insectfriends helped to till the soil, and his tall bamboos gave him shadeand cooled the air. And Jadav kept on planting.
Soon, his Arjun, ejar and gulmohar, his koroi, moj and himolu, and all his manyother plants dug in, took root and started growing. As they grew,they spread new seeds, and the new seeds, in turn, took root. Shootsbecame trunks, trunks grew branches, and the branches reached for thesky.
Thefew-trees-place that was once a no-tree-place now became a wonderful,green many-trees-place.But what'sa many-trees-place without many tree-creatures? When one came, theothers followed.
First, camethe birds. They flocked and flew in from near and far, to make theirnests in Jadav's tree-place. There were vultures and pelicans andstorks and ducks. And warblers and thrushes and wagtails and chats.
Next, camethe animals. They skipped and swung and sauntered in, to make theirhomes in the many-trees-place. There were buffaloes and deer andrabbits and gibbons. And elephants and tigers and rhinos.
Finally,there came the snakes. They slithered and swayed and sashayed in, tocool themselves in the shade of Jadav's trees.When Jadavsaw the snakes, he sat down and cried happy tears. He was sohappy that he wasn't even afraid of getting bitten.
Jadav'stree-place had filled with feathers and beaks and wings, with clawsand tails and fangs.There werespots and splashes, stripes and flashes, and green, green,everywhere.Thetree-place was a forest, at last. And Jadav was a happy man.
Then Jadavhad another thought. "Many trees in one place is good, I know. But how wonderful it'd be if there were many trees in every place!"So hegrabbed his bags of seeds and started walking across the world. Andas he walked, Jadav started planting the seeds in all theno-tree-places he saw. And he planted. And planted. And planted.But thereare so many no-tree-places in the world. There are moreno-tree-places than tree-places now. This is terribly sad, but Jadavdoes not sit down and cry this time.
Jadav plants.
And plants. And plantssome more.
It’sgoing to be hard work, bringing all the old forests back.The seashave begun rising, and the winds grow cold. Towns have become cities,and Jadav is growing old. But he keeps on planting. And planting. Andplanting.
Jadav willkeep on planting until the whole world is a happy, lovelylots-of-trees-place.
Jadav in Real LifeJadav‘Mulai’ Payeng is a conservationist and recipient of thePadmashree, one of the highest civilian honours awarded by the Indiangovernment. Jadav lives in Majuli, Assam.At the ageof 16, distressed by the sight of dying snakes that had washed up ona sandbar banking the Brahmaputra, Jadav decided to plant some treesin the spot. He started small, with bamboos, and grew an entireforest, plant by painstaking plant. This was back in 1979.Over thenext three decades, Jadav and his tree-planting have managed tochange the soil in the barren area. The 550-hectare sandbar is now alush, dense forest and home to a variety of flora and fauna,including elephants, tigers, apes, deer and many species of local andmigratory birds. Jadav continues to visit and nurture his forestevery day, planting wherever he finds empty patches.
GrowingUp With a Mango Tree: a Tree-Planting ActivityJust ate amango? Loved it? Want another? You can go to a shop and buy one, ofcourse. But it's a lot more fun (and free!) to use the seed of themango you just ate and make a few fruits of your own. All you need istime and patience.First, finda nice patch of empty land near your house. Get a friend, sibling orgrown-up to help you plant the seed you saved in that patch. Makesure the soil is loose and there's plenty of sun. It may take severalweeks of waiting, watering and watching before your seed turns into aplant, so don't worry and definitely don't hurry.
Once yourseed germinates and grows into a healthy mango plant, get ready for alot more waiting, watering and watching. Take care that your plantdoesn't get eaten up by insects or animals, or get stepped on bysomeone. If all this waiting is making you feel bored, read a fewbooks, sing some songs, and plant some more plants!After a fewyears, as you grow taller, your mango plant will grow tall with you,until it becomes a big tree that you can climb and picnic under. Thisis when the real fun begins. By now, your tree will have startedmaking its own mangoes, which you and your friends can eat. Evenbetter, those mangoes will soon start attracting other mango-lovingcreatures to your tree: birds, ants, squirrels, bats, monkeys,spiders and lots more.Some ofthese creatures will come to eat the fruit, some will come to feed onthe tree's sap, some to drink nectar from its flowers, and somecreatures will even come to eat some of the other creatures hangingaround the tree. But it's not all about eating. Some creatures maycome just to rest in your tree's shade, or to take a nap in itsbranches. Your tree has many different uses for every differentcreature!Spend sometime every day watching who visits your mango tree, at which time ofthe day they come, and what they do. Write down what you see in yournotebook. Also draw pictures of what you see.See howmuch you've done and learned with just one mango seed? Isn'ttree-planting fun? Now imagine how much fun Jadav must have hadplanting his entire forest full of trees!
His hoe* was too short.* Long gardening tool.
His doorway was too low.
His bed was tooshort.
His bicycle was short too.
This man was too tall!
He made a hoe with a very long handle.
He made very tall  door frames.
He made a very long bed.
He bought a very high bicycle.
He sat on a very high chair. He ate with a very long fork.
He left his house and lived in a big forest. He lived for there happily.
Long time ago, animals had no legs. They all used to crawl.
Only people had legs, which Maguru gave to them.
One day, Maguru decided to give legs to every animal. He wanted them to walk. He told them about it.
The animals said, "It will be very nice to have legs." They sang and danced.
The animals said it was hard to crawl.They felt pain.
When the day came, many animals went to Maguru's house. Giraffes, lions, elephants, rabbits, crocodiles and birds stood in a line.
Each animal was given four legs. Birds were given two legs each.
Everything was different after they got legs. Some danced for joy.Others fell down.
They went to show people.The animals said, "We will never crawl again."
The last one in the line was Millipede. Maguru asked, "Is thereanyone else after you?"Millipede answered, "No, I am the last one."
Maguru thought, "He is the last one. What will I do with the rest of the legs?" Maguru gave Millipede all the remaining legs.
Millipede was very happy. He said, "I will move faster than others."
After Millipede left, Snake came to Maguru's house. He said to Maguru, "Please give me some legs."
Maguru said, "I have given out all the legs.Where were you?" Snake answered, "I overslept."
Maguru looked to see if there were legs remaining.He did not find any.
Maguru said to Snake,"Sorry, There are no legs left." Snake crawled home without legs. From that day, Snake does not sleep much. He is waiting to be first in line to get legs.
One evening, Tina was sitting outside with her father. She looked at the sky. She could see the bright stars twinkling.“Dad, the stars look like sparkling butterflies. How lovely they are!" Tina sighed. “Dad, I want the stars. Will you buy me some?”Tina's father laughed.
“Ooh! Tina. The stars are not for sale. They can only be found up there in the sky,” her father told her.“So, will you go up there someday to get them for me?” Tina asked.“Wait patiently, Tina. I’ll find you the stars.”
“Ooh! Okay." Tina paused. "Friday is close to Saturday, isn’t it ?” “Yes,” Tina’s father responded. “Friday is close to Saturday. These days come one after the other.”"Can you look for the stars on Saturday, Dad?" Tina asked.
Tina's father was quiet. So was Tina.Then she said, “When I grow up, I’ll go and get the stars.”The two laughed and went back in the house.
Tina was playing. Suddenly, an angel appeared. The angel was shining brightly. He shone like the stars.Tina smiled and asked, “Can I become an angel too?”The angel just laughed, lightly.  “Tina, you’re very curious girl. Why do you ask?” “I love the stars. They amaze me. I wish I could fly up close to them. They twinkle and I’m happy when I look at them,” said Tina.
“I’ll give you wings,” the angel said. Then the angel touched Tina on her back. Wings sprouted from her shoulders! “Thank you very much!" Tina called.The angel had disappeared.
Tina raised her head. I can’t go on my own to pluck the stars from the sky, she thought.She then shouted to the stars, “Hey, dear Stars, I’m coming to get you.”The stars showed that they had heard her. They shone even brighter.
A pigeon was passing by, she heard Tina calling out to the stars. She followed Tina.“Are you talking to the stars?” she asked her.“Yes! And I’m looking for a friend to accompany me into the sky.”
“I will go with you,” the Pigeon said. Then, together they flew up, up, and up. They flapped their wings. They traveled until they reached the gates of heaven.They found an old guard. "Can we come inside?" they asked.
The old guard said, “Whoever manages to answer my question will have permission to step inside. Okay?”“Okay,” Tina and the pigeon responded.“If you add one star to four other stars, how many do you get?” the guard asked.“The answer is five stars,” Tina responded quickly.Tina worked hard at school. She liked all the subjects. But she loved maths best. The guard was impressed. He told her, “That's right! Go inside, but take no more than five stars each.”
Tina and her friend the pigeon selected five big stars each. Tina wanted to give one to her dad, another to her mom, another to her brother, and another to her friend, Fatuma. Her fifth star, she would keep for herself.
Was it all a dream? It felt real to Tina.As she slept, her face shone with a smile. One hand was closed in a tight fist, as if she was holding stars.
Tina laughed a bit in her sleep. Her parents went into the room to make sure she was OK.Tina's mother kissed her on the forehead.
A week later, Tina's father father brought her a surprise. Two toy stars! Inside the stars were  miniature lights.They shone and twinkled. They gave out very beautiful light. Tina loved them! She placed two stars in her room.She couldn't wait to fall asleep and share them with her friend pigeon.
Dad loves porridge.
I love cornflakes.
Dad loves coffee.
I love milk.
Dad loves apples.
I love oranges.
Dad loves bread. I love toasted bread.
We both love fat cakes (vetkoek).
I have a friend. She lives in my house.
When I am happy, so is she.
When I cry, she cries too.
But I cannot hear her voice. My friend lives inside the mirror.
“Come out,” I tell her, “we will play.” She does not come out.
I am not happy. I go to sleep.
She comes out of the mirror in my sleep! And we have fun.
We play, we run, we shout and scream together.
When I talk to her, she also talks to me.
In the morning, my friend will go back into the mirror.
But I don't mind at all. We will play again in my dreams!
Meera and I are a team. She’s my most favourite person in the world. Do you know why? She’s the only one who can see me!
Everything she likes, I like. Everything I like, she likes. Our names also sound the same. Meera and Ameera!
Things that happen to her happen to me too. “I lost another tooth,” Meera says. While I lost another quill.
Sometimes, we can be a little different. Meera makes up problems. I make them go away.
Like the other day when it was raining—“Oh no, now we can’t go out to play,” Meera cried.
But I had an idea! Off we sailed on a paper boat.
Or the time when she started school.“What if I don’t make any friends?” Meera was worried.“You made friends with me. Now go make one more friend,” I told her.
It’s my turn to tell the story now. Ameera is my most favourite person in the world. Do you know why? She turns stuff upside down, just so I have a different view.
Ameera never lets me walk into a fight alone. Even though she doesn’t help much.
She makes every day a BIG adventure. Like the time we had to get out of a murukku maze. “I know! Let’s eat our way out,” Ameera said.
Like Ameera said, we’re a team.

There was a boy whose name was Abel. He made himself a cart. Abel had no driver for his new cart. He said to his sister Meri, "I want a driver for my cart. Please give me your doll. She can sit in the cart."
But Meri said, "No, I want my doll." When Meri would not let him take the doll, Abel was very angry. He grabbed the doll and pulled her. Meri pulled the doll's other arm. Abel pulled and Meri pulled. The doll's arm came off!
Meri cried and ran to her mother. "Look Mother," she said, "Abel pulled my doll's arm and it came off. He wanted my doll to sit in his new cart but I wanted to play with her." Her mother said, "Abel did not behave well."
Mother thought about how to teach her son not to touch his sister's toys. She had an idea. She went to her friend who was a doctor and she asked, "I want you to help me please." The doctor replied, "How can I help, my friend?"
Mother answered, "My son Abel is behaving badly these days. He pulled the arm off his sister's doll. He must not do that. Tomorrow I will tell him to bring the doll to you to put the doll's arm on again."
"Please tell Abel that he must pay you for your work. He doesn't have any money, so you will tell him to clean your big old car that is always dusty," said mother. Her friend laughed and said, "Ee–ee! That will be good."
Abel's mother went back to her house. She asked Abel, "When you are ill or hurt where do you go?" Abel answered, "When I am ill or hurt, I must go to the doctor." Abel's mother said, "You hurt the doll, now you must take her to the doctor."
So Abel took the doll to the doctor. "This doll is hurt very badly. My mother told me to bring the doll to you. Doctor, can you give her a new arm?" The doctor agreed to look after the doll. She was able to make a new arm.
The doctor said to Abel, "The doll has a new arm. You must pay me. How much money do you have?" Abel answered, "Please doctor, I don't have any money. I can't pay you for your work."
The doctor said, "Well! You don't have any money? My big car is very dirty! Clean my car and that is how you will pay me." Abel got a bucket of water and a clean cloth. It took a long time to wash that dusty car.
Then Abel took the doll back to Meri. She was delighted and she said to Abel, "You are a good brother. Thank you for fixing my doll." "My sister, I'm sorry for getting angry and making you sad," said Abel.
From that day, Abel never took his sister's things again. And he tried his best not to get angry with her.Abel remembered how long it took him to wash the doctor's big, dirty car. He decided it wasn't worth the price to get angry and break things.

A woman with her baby went into the forest. She went to pick fruit.
In the forest she found a tree with ripe fruit.
She put down her sleeping baby and climbed the tree.
An erotot from another community came by. He saw the baby. He was surprised. He asked himself, "Where is the mother?"
He bent down. The sound of the chains on his neck woke the baby.
He let the baby play with his chains. The baby laughed as he played.
The woman looked down to see why the baby was laughing. She saw the stranger.
She was so afraid that she dropped her bag of fruit.
The erotot looked up. He said, "Don't be afraid. I'm only playing with your beautiful baby."
So the woman came down from the tree.
The erotot took off one of his chains. He gave it to the baby. "Here is a gift for you," he said.
"Go home with your baby. Tell your husband to move to a more peaceful village. Your baby has given me peace," said the erotot.

Did you see Dog running towards cars? Now he has enough money to buy his shoes. He wants to go to town.

The rains did not come. The land was very dry.
This monkey left home to look for water and food.
She walked over hills and valleys.
She came to a place named Tirkol.
Monkey was very happy in this place.
She ate fruit and got fat. But she missed her friends.
So Monkey made the long journey home.
The other monkeys were joyful to see her.
"Where is this wonderful place with fruit?" they asked her.
"I will take you there," said Monkey.
The other monkeys loved Tirkol. They decided to stay there forever.
But the monkeys from Tirkol were worried.
"These new monkeys will eat all our fruit," they said.
The Tirkol monkeys went to attack the new monkeys.
"Why fight?" asked an elder. "There is enough fruit for all!"
This was true. So the monkeys decided to live together peacefully.
Amara was nine years old. She went to Kerema primary school. Her favorite subjects were English, Science and Social Studies. She wanted to be a lawyer when she grew up. Amara loved animals very much.
Amara lived with her mother, Margy. She was a very hardworking farmer. Amara's father died when she was 5 years old.
When Amara was not at school, she spent her time with Mbisa, the goat. She cleaned and fed it.
Amara also had her pet, Simba. Her mother did not like  dogs very much, but she let Amara keep Simba. Whenever Simba disturbed her, she would shout, "Go away before I kick you out." Amara felt sad.
One Saturday, they had visitors from the women's group. Amara was happy that her mother's friends had come with their children. They could play football.
Her mother had prepared the food that the group liked. Amara was reminded by her mother to keep Simba locked up. It barked at strangers.
Amara did not hear her mother calling because they were busy playing.
When Amara went to the house, she called Simba out. Simba was very obedient to Amara. After the meal, the visitors said, "We'll also treat our dogs well like Amara. We mistreat them and yet they are so helpful."
Afterwards, Amara's mother apologised for being mean and cruel to  Simba. Amara was happy that her mother accepted her dog at last. When Amara is in school her mother feeds Simba. Her mother's friends have learned to be good to their dogs.

Little Goat was not outside. He was hiding inside with his mother.
Little Leopard shouted,  "Let us go to the field to play."
Little Goat said,  "We are not friends anymore. I listen to my mama. Good children listen to their mamas."
Little Leopard was sad. He went back to his mama.

Today is  Vasant Panchami. My parents say it is the first day of spring. Spring is the season between winter and summer. It is called Vasant Ritu in Sanskrit.
In many parts of India, people pray to the goddess of learning, music and art on this day. Many birds are sitting on the tree near my house. I think they are singing to me.
The leaves on the tree are new and shiny. Just like my new frock. Amma is also wearing a yellow sari ― such a pretty colour ‘basanti’, and such a pretty name!
Grandpa wants me to plant a tree. “But why?” I ask. “So that you will have a friend to grow up with, Meenu,” he says. “Spring is a good season to start something new.”
We go to the garden. Grandpa and I dig a hole in the ground and plant a sapling. “How tall will it grow?” I ask him.
"Wait and watch, dear Meenu!" he says. The squirrels are chasing each other. Tingu, the cat, chases a squirrel. And I want to chase Tingu.
The garden is full of flowers.I like the yellow roses the best and Grandpa likes the white jasmine.There is a carpet of leaves under some trees.
Many trees have flowers. I like spring! Everything looks so pretty in spring!
Tomorrow is Holi. School is closed for two days. We have made a huge Holika with twigs, and pieces of wood. Some of us went to the forest and brought tesu flowers. Manu put the flowers in a tank of water. The water has turned a bright orange!
Tomorrow we will play Holi with the orange water. We will get gujia and puris to eat. Spring is such a happy season. It is not cold, it is not hot, and it is not wet. I  can play all the time!
The year was 1870. New London, Connecticut, United States. 7 am. Kids were tumbling out of bed, their mothers hurrying them to clean their teeth, handing them tooth sticks and jars of toothpaste.
What? Did I just say – “Toothsticks”?That’s right. They used toothsticks to clean their teeth back in 1870. A toothstick was simply a twig with a frayed end. Some lucky kids had twigs with boar hair tied to one end for that extra shine.
And what was that other thing I said? “Jars of toothpaste”?That’s right. Toothpaste tubes were not invented yet. They only had jars.And every bleary eyed kid started her day by dipping a toothstick into a porcelain jar filled with toothpaste.
Actually, into the same porcelain jar that every other member of the family dipped their toothstick into. Including that visiting grand aunt with yellow and black teeth, whose toothstick matched her teeth.
One morning, a disgusted cry went up in a dentist’s house. “Ewwwwwwwwww!” It was Dr. Sheffield’s son Lucius, who refused to dip into the jar anymore and decided to use tooth powder henceforth. But a thought remained in his mind – there must be a better way to use toothpaste.
A few years later, Lucius went to Paris to study the science of dentistry. There, he saw artists squeezing paint from metal tubes on to their paintbrushes. Why couldn't the same type of tube be used to hold toothpaste?! He rushed back home and shared this idea with his father, who thought that it was just totally awesome.
Therewas just that little matter of figuring out how to get the toothpastefroma jar intothe tube through that little opening. Howdo you think Lucius could fill toothpaste into an empty tube?Haveyou had a bad morning when you squeezed way too much paste in yourhalf asleep  state? And you seethat there’s toothpaste all over the sink and your mother is remindingyou that the school bus will be at the doorstep in twenty minutes,and the last thing you want is for her to flip when she sees the messyou’ve made? How would you go about putting the toothpaste backinto the tube? Now, whatdo you think Lucius and his father used to fill a tube withtoothpaste? Aear bud? Or a really tiny spoon? A toothpick?
It was not as messy as you’d expect, because the way Dr. Sheffield and his team did it was without opening the cap! That’s right, they kept the cap screwed on tight, and opened up the other end! It’s definitely easier to fill a tube from the larger end, especially if you have something to pump the paste with, like a syringe. After that, all you have to do is seal the end tight so that the paste will not leak.
Today, toothpaste tubes are filled using machines. All the empty tubes are lined up on a conveyer belt with their caps downwards and the unsealed end pointing up. A big container filled with toothpaste is fixed above the conveyor belt.
From a nozzle at the bottom of the container, the toothpaste is let into each of these tubes as they move along the conveyor belt. But the paste is not filled all the way to the brim. About half an inch is left so that it can be sealed.Now the tube is ready to be squeezed!
Ancient Indian wisdom for good teeth Many people in India use datun, the twig of a neem or babool tree, instead of a factory-made brush. Datun keeps teeth and gums healthy. But do you know which the best brush in the world is? Your fingers, say dentists! Great for the teeth and gums. Have you tried tooth powder? What are the different smells that you can detect in it?Herbs and spices that are good for teeth include mint, clove, cinnamon, black pepper and tulsi. Eating fibrous fruits and vegetables, like apples and carrots, is good for cleaning teeth.
Fun with toothpaste caps
The small bus stop in my village was busy with people and overloaded buses. On the ground were even more things to load. Touts were shouting the names where the buses were going.
"City! City! Going west!" I heard a tout shouting. That was the bus I needed to catch.
The city bus was almost full,  but more people were still pushing to get on. Some packed their luggage under the bus. Others put their things on the racks inside.
New passengers clutched their tickets as they looked for somewhere to sit in the crowded bus. Women with young children made them comfortable for the long journey.
I squeezed in next to a window. The person sitting next to me was holding tightly to a green plastic bag. He wore old sandals,  a worn out coat,  and he looked nervous.
I looked outside the bus and realised that I was leaving my village,  the place where I had grown up. I was going to the big city.
The loading was completed and all passengers were seated. Hawkers still pushed their way into the bus to sell their goods to the passengers. Each one was shouting the names of what was available for sale. The words sounded funny to me.
A few passengers bought drinks,  others bought small snacks and began to chew. Those who did not have any money,  like me,  just watched.
These activities were interrupted by the hooting of the bus,  a sign that we were ready to leave. The tout yelled at the hawkers to get out.
The hawkers pushed each other to make their way out of the bus. Some gave back change to the travelers. Others made last minute attempts to sell more.
As the bus left the bus stop,  I stared out of the window. I wondered if I would ever go back to my village again.
As the journey progressed,  the inside of the bus got very hot. I closed my eyes,  hoping to sleep.
But my mind drifted back home. Will my mother be safe? Will my rabbits fetch any money? Will my brother remember to water my tree seedlings?
On the way,  I memorised the name of the place where my uncle lived in the big city. I was still mumbling it when I fell asleep.
Nine hours later,  I woke up with loud banging and calling for passengers going back to my village. I grabbed my small bag and jumped out of the bus.
The return bus was filling up quickly. Soon it would make its way back east.  The most important thing for me now,  was to start looking for my uncle's house.
“I can’t lift you up, Shanu!” says Ammi. “You are too big!”
“You can’t walk to school alone, Shanu!” says Abbu. “You are too small!”
“You can’t sleep in the baby’s cot, Shanu!” says Dadu. “You are too big!”
“You can’t carry the baby to the park, Shanu!” says Dadi. “You are too small!”
Shanu is puzzled. Too big! Too small! How can she be too big andtoo small all at once?
Too big to wear her old pink frock.Too small to make dosas at the stove.
Too big to climb up on Dadu’s back?Too smallto carry the baby on hers?
“What am I the right size for?” Shanu wonders.
Ammi smiles and says, “Why, you are just big enough to go to big school.”
“And you are just small enough for me to carry you on my shoulders,” says Abbu.
“You are just big enough to take me for my morning walks,” says Dadu.
“And you are just small enough for me to tell stories to,” says Dadi.
“And you will always, always be the perfect size...for this!" all say, and give her a warm, wonderful hug.
Long, long ago, the Sky God, Nyame, kept all stories locked in a wooden box, high in the sky. People down on earth had no stories to tell and they were very sad. They asked Anansi the clever Spider to help them.
Anansi spun a long thread, and climbed up his sticky thread all the way to heaven. “Can I have the stories, please?” he asked the Sky God. But Nyame laughed at Anansi and said, “Oh, these are very expensive stories. You wouldn't be able to pay for them, little spider.”
“How much do the stories cost?” asked Anansi. “You'll have to bring me three rare and fierce animals,” Nyame answered, “A leopard with sharp teeth like spears, a hornet that stings people, and a snake that swallows people whole.” He laughed and laughed. He thought his stories were quite safe.
So Anansi climbed slowly back down his sticky thread to the earth. He thought and he thought, and he came up with a plan. He dug a deep hole, covered it with branches and dirt so it was hidden, and he went home for supper. In the morning, sure enough, a leopard had fallen into his pit. He was furiously scratching at the side of the pit, but he couldn't get out.
“Oh let me help you, my dear friend!” said Anansi. “Just lie down on these sticks and I'll pull you out.” Anansi wound his sticky web round the leopard and the sticks, and pulled him up to heaven to show the Sky God. But Nyame just laughed and said, “Where are the other two?”
So Anansi went back down to earth to get the second creature. He thought and he thought and he came up with a plan. He took a gourd full of water and went to the tree where the hornets lived. He poured out some of the water all over their nest. Then he cut a leaf from a banana tree and held it over his head, and he poured the rest of the water all over himself.
He called out to the hornets, “Hey hornets! Come see! It is raining! Quick ­get inside my gourd and it will keep all of you dry.” Hornets don't like to get wet, so they all flew into Anansi's gourd.
Then Anansi quickly spun a web across the opening so the hornets couldn't get out no matter how much they buzzed. He carried them up to heaven and showed them to the Sky God. But Nyame just said, “Where's the last one?” (He wasn't laughing so much anymore.).
So Anansi went down to earth again. He thought and thought and he thought, but he couldn't come up with a plan. So he asked his wife, who had a very good idea. Together they found a good long thick branch and some strong vines. When they got near the stream where the snake lived, they began to argue. “The branch is longer!” “No, it isn't!” “Yes it is!”
Soon the snake came out and asked what the argument was. “I was arguing with my wife,” said Anansi. “She says this stick is longer than you are. But I don't agree.” “Of course I'm longer than that stick!” said the snake. “I'm very long! I'm a huge snake! Just put your stick next to me and measure!”
So Anansi did that, and he tied the snake to the stick with his vine to keep him straight. When he was all tied up, Anansi took the snake up to heaven.
Nyame had to admit that Anansi had paid his price. So he went to his wooden box, opened the lid, and gave all the stories to Anansi. Anansi carried the stories triumphantly down to earth. He shared them with his wife, and with all the other animals and people. Stories are for telling, not for keeping in wooden boxes.
"Mom," calls Lebo. "Come and look. These clothes are all too small for me!" "Let me see," says Mom.
"Look at my skirt. It's too small," says Lebo. "Yes,  it is," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your skirt."
"Look at my jeans. They're too small," says Lebo. "Yes, they are," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your jeans."

Once upon a time, there was a hungry jackal. He was walking around the bush looking for food.
He came across a grapevine. He spotted a bunch of juicy ripe grapes hanging from a high branch.
"Those look really delicious," he thought. He took a few steps back so that he could make his highest jump.
The grapes were too high. Jackal fell on his back without even touching the bunch.
Jackal got up and went further back from his starting spot. He ran, and almost got high enough. But he fell even harder.
He tried again and again. But he couldn't get to the grapes. He kept falling until his back was very sore.
Finally, he gave up and walked away.
He stopped and looked back at the grapes. He was hungrier than ever. "Those grapes look really sour anyway," he thought.
Putta and Puttijumped out of bed. It was Muttajji's birthday and they had a train tocatch!
Muttajji, who wasthe twins' mother's mother's mother,  lived in Mysore with Ajji, whowas the twins' mother's mother.  No one actually knew when Muttajji'sbirthday was; Ajji had always celebrated it on the MakaraSankranthi holiday. "Amma, willthere be a cake?"  asked Putti. "A big, spongy cake withpink icing and a rose on top?""Naah,"said Putta. "Old people don't have birthday cakes. And 200candles won't fit on any cake." "Muttajjiisn't 200 years old, silly," said Putti. "How old isMuttajji, Amma?"Amma smiled. "Whydon't you ask her when we get there?"
The moment theyreached the old green house in Mysore, the twins burst intoMuttajji's room. "Happy birthday, Muttajji! How old are youtoday?" Muttajji huggedthe twins. "How old am I? Who knows?  How does it matter?" "But itdoes!" cried Putta and Putti together.
Muttajji smiled."Well," she said, "I know that around five yearsbefore I was born, our Maharaja went to a grand party for IndianMaharajas and Maharanis in Delhi. A British king and queen had cometo visit, and our Maharaja got a gold medal." "Oooh! Aparty! There must have been lots of cake!" said Putti. "Whowas this king, Muttajji? If you know, we can find out which year hevisited. if we add five years to that, we will know when YOU wereborn!" Muttajjishrugged. "I've forgotten, Putta." Putta's face fell.
"Wait,"said Muttajji. "Let me see if I can remember something else.Aaaan! When I was about your age - nine or ten - my uncle from Bombayvisited us and told us about clean trains.""Cleantrains?" "Yes!"Muttajji was excited. "They had started running in Bombay thatyear. You never got dirty travelling in them.  No black dust on yourclothes and face, no grime, nothing!" The twins staredat her. Why would anyone get dirty travelling by train?
"Some yearslater," continued Muttajji, "I got married. The law wasthat a girl should be at least 15 before she was married, and myfather would never break the law, so I must have been 16 then.  Verysoon after my marriage, your Muttajja got a job in Bombay, and weleft Mysore."  "Didanything important happen the year you got married, Muttajji?" asked Putta. "Yes,"said Muttajji sadly. "Our Maharaja inaugurated our big dam, andthe beautiful gardens next to it, during the Dasara festival thatyear. But I missed it; I was in Bombay. ""A big dam?"Putta sat up. "Is it still there?"
Muttajji hootedwith laughter. "Of course! Rock-solid too. It was the dam thattamed the Kaveri. No more floods in the monsoon, and enough water forthe fields in the summer."Ajji put her headaround the door. "Are you talking about KRS, Amma?""Aaaan,KRS," Muttajji said, looking fondly at Ajji. "Your Ajji wasmy fifth child, the youngest, but always the smartest.  Do you know,twins, my children came like clockwork, one every two monsoons. Theday your Ajji decided to come out, your Muttajja could not be found.Later, he told us that he had gone to see Gandhiji give a speech atthe Gowalia Tank Maidan. He was so excited. 'Quit India!' he keptshouting the whole day, silly man, disturbing the baby.'
"QuitIndia!" Putti's eyes grew round with excitement. "Westudied it in history, Putta! The movement started in 1942! Thatmeans 1942 was the year that... ""...Ajji wasborn," pouted Putta. "Not Muttajji." "That's astart!" said Putti. "Which year were you born, Ajji?""I will be74 this year," said Ajji. "So I was born in?" Puttiquickly did the calculations. "1942!*" she said. Ajjinodded.*(2016 - 74 =1942)
"Now, Ajjiis Muttajji's fifth child and all her kids were two years apart!"said Putta. "So if Ajji was born in 1942...""...Muttajji'sfourth child was born in 1942 - 2 = 1940, the third in 1940 - 2 =1938, the second in 1938 - 2 = 1936, and the first in 1936 - 2 =1934." "So Muttajjiwas married in 1932!" cried Putti. "Notnecessarily," said Putta. "Muttajji didn't say her firstchild was born two years after her marriage. She only said a dam wasbuilt in Mysore the year she got married."
"Maybe thiswill help, twins," said Ajji, bringing in bowls of vermicellipayasa, Muttajji's favourite sweet dish. "KRS is theKrishnarajasagar Dam. The Brindavan Gardens are the gardens attachedto it. We went there last year to see the musical fountains,remember?"The twins nodded."Mmmm," said Putti. "Your payasa is the BEST, Ajji!"  "When wasKRS built, do you know, Ajji?" Ajji shook herhead. "I'm not sure. But you can go with Ajja to the centrallibrary after lunch and find out there."
In the library,Putti found a book on the history of Mysore. "Here it is!"she whispered.  "Two of Mysore's most visited tourist spots,the KRS Dam and the adjacent Brindavan Gardens, were opened to thepublic in 1932.'" The twins grinned - that meant Muttajjihad indeed married in 1932, 84* years ago!  *(2016 - 1932 = 84)
"Muttajjithinks she was 16 when she got married," said Putti, "butshe could have been 15 or 17 or 18.""She alsosaid she was about 9 or 10 when her Bombay uncle told her about the'clean' train," said Putta. "Ajja may know what thatmeans."Ajja was in thereading room. "Ajja," whispered Putti, "in the oldendays, did people get dirty travelling by train?" Ajja nodded."There were steam engines then, which ran on coal, notelectricity," he said. "Black coal dust used to fly out ofthe chimney and land on everyone and everything. Terrible!"  "That's it,Putti!" hissed Putta."Electric trains were the 'clean'trains!"
He pulled out abook on the Indian Railways. "It says here," he pointed,"that India's first electric train came to Bombay in 1925!" "And Muttajji says she was about 9 then," said Putta. "If she is right, then Muttajji was born in 1916*. ""But she could be wrong, you know," frowned Putti. "Only one way to make sure," said Putta. "We have to find out if that big party for kings and queens in Delhi, which Muttajji said happened five years before she was born, happened in 1911**."They ran back to Ajja.*(1925-9 =1916); **(1916 -5 = 1911)
"Ajja, wasthere a grand party for a foreign king who visited India around1911?" Ajja frowned."1911? Why is that date so familiar? Aaan yes. It was the yearthe Gateway of India was built in Bombay. And yes, it was built towelcome the British Emperor of India, George V! There must have beenseveral grand parties, not one." Ajja tapped his forehead,looking very pleased with himself. "Not bad for an old brain,eh?" "Not bad atall!" cried the twins. "Thanks, Ajja!" They knewexactly how old Muttajji was!
Five minuteslater, the twins were racing homewards. "Muttajji, "they panted, rushing straight to her room, "did the MysoreMaharaja get his gold medal from King George V?" "Aaaaaan!"Muttajji said happily. "That's it! George! What clever childrenyou are!" "That means,Muttajji, that you were born in 1916! You are exactly 100* years oldtoday!"*(2016 - 1916 = 100)
"That'sgreat detective work, twins!" smiled Amma. "I think you -and Muttajji - deserve a special treat. A big, spongy one, with pinkicing, and a rose on top." "Hurrayyyyyy!"cheered the twins.
The GrandMaharaja-Maharani Party (and other fun stuff from Indian history)Remember all theimportant historical events Muttajji talked about in the story? Theyall really happened! Here is a little more information about them.
The GrandMaharaja-Maharani Party (1911) - When the British Emperor GeorgeV and his wife Queen Mary visited India for the first time, theyhosted a grand party for over 400 Indian kings and queens. It wascalled the Delhi Durbar. To feed 200,000 guests, bakeries put out20000 loaves of bread a day, and over 1000 cattle and sheep wereslaughtered for every meal! Many Indian rulers received gold medalsfrom the Emperor, including the Maharaja of Mysore, KrishnarajaWodeyar IV.
The CleanTrains (1925)  - On Feb 3, 1925, India's first electric train leftBombay's Victoria Terminus for Kurla station. With that, India becamethe 3rd country in Asia and only the 24th in the world to introducerailway electrification.The Dam ThatTamed The Kaveri (1932) -  The Kaveri river runs through southernKarnataka and Tamil Nadu. The river was always a blessing, keepingMysore fertile, but, like every other river, it used to flood in themonsoons and run dry in the summer.  All that changed when a dam wasbuilt across the river and the Krishna Raja Sagara (KRS) reservoircreated.  The reservoir still provides most of the drinking water forBangalore city.
Gandhiji's BigSpeech (1942) -  The 'Quit India Speech' was a speech made byGandhiji on 8 August 1942, at the Gowalia Tank Maidan in Bombay. Gandhiji asked people to fight against British rule not by usingviolence, but by disobeying their laws. Five years later, on August15, 1947, the non-violent war got the results Gandhiji wanted - theBritish left, and India became independent. Today, the Gowalia TankMaidan is called the August Kranti Maidan in memory of that peacefulrevolution.

Everyone knows that the elephant has a very long nose.
But a long time ago, the elephant's nose was short and fat. Like a shoe in the middle of its face.
One day a baby elephant was born. She was curious about everything. She had a question for every animal.
She was curious about Giraffe. “Why do you have a long neck?” she asked.
She was curious about Rhino. “Why does your horn have a sharp point?”
She was curious about Hippo. “Why do you have red eyes?” she asked.
And she was VERY curious about Crocodile. “What does Crocodile eat for dinner?” she asked.
﻿“Never ask a question like that!” said her mother. Then she walked off, frowning.
Quickly Crow flew down to baby elephant.“Follow me to the river. There you will see what Crocodile eats for dinner,” squawked Crow.
So the baby elephant followed Crow down to the river.
She pushed through the reeds and stood on the bank. She looked into the water. Where was Crocodile?
“Hello,” said a stone near the river bank.“Hello,” said Baby Elephant. “Can you tell me what Crocodile eats for dinner?” she asked.
“Bend down and I will tell you,” said the stone. “Lower, lower,” said the stone. So Baby Elephant bent down lower, and lower.
Then suddenly, “Snap!” Baby Elephant's nose was caught in Crocodile's jaws.“Crocodile will eat you for dinner!” squawked Crow, and flew away.
Baby Elephant sat back on her strong legs and pulled. She pulled, and pulled. But Crocodile did not let go of her nose.
Baby Elephant's nose stretched, and stretched, and stretched. Then, “Thud!” she fell on her back.
Crocodile sunk back into the water. He was cross about losing his dinner.
Baby Elephant looked at her nose. It was stretched very long. She could not see where it ended!
Her nose was so long she could pick fruit from high branches.
Her nose was so long she could shower her back with water. From that day, all elephants had long and useful trunks.

Once upon a time, there was a long dry spell. The animals ate all the grass in the country. Only the imbowa plants on the big trees survived.
One day, Goat saw Hyena pass by with a knife. Goat asked for the knife so that she could cut imbowa plants to eat.
Hyena gave the knife to Goat. She cut down the climbing plant, and ate until she was full. Goat forgot all about the knife she had used.
When Hyena returned to ask for the knife, Goat was at a loss. She could not remember where she had dropped it.
Goat scratched here and there in search of the knife. Up to today Goat is still looking for that knife.
Hyena told Goat, "Since you have lost my knife, which was the source of my livelihood, I will eat you. Then I will eat your offspring!"
From that time, Hyena has never spared Goat.
Meanwhile, Goat continues to search for Hyena's knife.

Rose came home from school with a new idea.“Appa! I know how to make compost!”
“What is compost?” asked Appa, scratching his head.“Can I make it in the backyard, Appa?” Rose asked, tugging Rocky’s ear.“But what is compost?” Appa asked, scratching his ear.
“It’s what plants eat, Appa,” said Rose. It makes them grow tall and strong.”“Baaaaa! Even I knew that!” bleated Rocky.Appa looked worried.“Oh, don't worry, Appa. All I need to make compost is waste.”
Off they ran to the backyard to dig a hole. “Do you know what we need for compost, Rocky?”
“We need lots of vegetable and fruit peels. See, we don't have to waste anything any more!"
“We need lots of newspapers!”
“We need dry leaves!”
“And we need water!”
“Where did everything go?”
“ROCKY!”
In the swamp on the far side of the Far Forest, lived Sniffles, the Crocodile. Sniffles was always crying big crocodile tears or going sniff... sniff... Even his mom was quite tired of him and would say, “Stop snivelling and crying, start behaving like a crocodile. Go hunt for your food.”
But Sniffles would burst into tears at the thought of eating another animal. So mom and dad had to feed Sniffles every day.
Sniffles did not want to be a crocodile. 'I am so ugly,' he thought, bursting into tears. He did not even want to live like crocodiles do. His best friend was Punch, a golden yellow butterfly. And Punch wanted to be big and strong. So Punch always had her feeler curled into a fist saying, “Look out! I will punch you in the mouth.”
They made a very funny pair. Sniffles swimming with Punch perched on his head. The other crocodiles would laugh and make fun of them. That did not bother Sniffles. He continued crying, sniffling and being friends with Punch.
One sunny afternoon, Punch settled herself near Sniffles’ ear and told him, “I have seen two men come this way with guns, they want to kill crocodiles for their skins.”“Don’t these men have skins of their own?” asked a puzzled Sniffles.“I don’t know Sniffles,” replied Punch. “Tell the other crocodiles and hide.”
“But Punch, they might shoot you. Oh! What will I do,” cried Sniffles sobbing loudly.“People catch butterflies with nets and pin them on a board, my grandaunt told me,” said Punch and flew away.
The other crocodiles heard Sniffles crying and shouting, “Men coming to kill us. Hide ... Hurry ... Hide.” At first the crocodiles did not believe Sniffles, but then they heard the men’s footsteps. The crocodiles went deep into the river and left some rotten logs floating on the water. The men shot at the logs which looked like crocodiles from afar. The men could not see any crocodiles, only hundreds of butterflies that flew into their faces and hair.
Shaking their heads and trying to brush off the butterflies they said, “There are no crocodiles here, we will bring nets and catch the butterflies.” And off they went. All the crocodiles got together and said, “Thank you, Punch.”“Thank you, butterflies.”
The next day Sniffles saw men with nets. He remembered Punch telling him about nets. “Punch, the nets! Come here quick! The men with the nets have come.” All the crocodiles came on the river bank. The butterflies settled on the backs and heads of the crocodiles.
A few of the crocodiles made a circle around the men as they came close. The crocodiles snapped their jaws. Sniffles was in front, gnashing his teeth and whipping his tail around most menacingly.
The men were so frightened that they took to their heels and ran right out of the swamp. The other crocodiles were very proud of Sniffles, as he had acted like a real crocodile. Now Sniffles was also proud to be one.
All the butterflies flew around the crocodiles, fluttering their wings.“Thank you, Sniffles, Thank you, crocodiles.”“It is all right,” said Sniffles shyly. “That is what friends are for, to take care of each other.”
“We have milk, eggs,bread  and vegetables in the fridge,” says Ma.“I’ll cook dinner!” says Pa.“Pa, can you make fried rice?” asks Tara. “Fried rice,” Madhav echoes.
As soon as Tara, Madhav, Ma and Pa enter the house, they know that something is wrong. Very wrong."Chee! What’s that smell?” cries Tara.“A MONSTER!” yells Madhav.
It is hot, dark and stinky. The whole house smells!Where is the smell coming from?
Ma opens the fridge. Everyone covers their noses and mouths.“Hmm, it’s warm inside and the light is off,” says Ma, sticking her arm into the fridge. “What happened?” asks Tara. "The fridge stopped working some time ago," Pa explains. "Without the cold air, everything spoiled,” says Ma, glumly.“Has the milk gone bad?” asks Tara.“Yes, can you smell how sour it is?” asks Ma.“Milk needs to be kept cold to stay fresh,” says Pa.
“Has the bread gone bad?” asks Tara.“Yes, do you see that green stuff? That’s mould,” says Pa, “It grows on the bread.”“Fuzzy,” says Madhav, curiously.“Don’t touch it,” says Pa. “You’ll fall sick if you eat it.”
“Have the vegetables gone bad too?” asks Tara, sadly.“Yes, they’re rotten,” says Ma. “We can’t eat them.”
Invisible MonstersTara and Madhav thought there was an invisible monster in their house. While there was no monster to be found, they were right about there being something invisible!When food goes ‘bad’—meaning it cannot be eaten by human beings—it’s because something invisible has begun to eat the food. These invisible beings are called microbes.Microbes aren’t totally invisible: they’re just very, very, very tiny (tinier than the tiniest insect you’ve ever seen). You need a machine called a microscope to be able to see them. They look something like this.
Leopard was always trying to catch Antelope.
And Antelope was always escaping from Leopard.
One day,  Leopard called out to Antelope,  "Let's be friends. What you eat,  I don't eat. Nothing makes us enemies."
Antelope agreed. So Leopard said,  "Let's make an oath to be friends. If either of us breaks the oath,  her child will die."
They made an oath to be friends. At night,  Antelope slept under a tree. Leopard slept in the branches above.
Antelope soon became fat. Leopard became thin.
Leopard was tempted to eat fat Antelope. She said to herself,  "I don't care about the oath. I don't even have a child!"
Leopard jumped down to catch Antelope. But she got caught between two branches.
Antelope was shocked. She leaped up and cried,  "Beh! Beh!"
Leopard begged,  "My friend,  help me. We agreed that whoever broke our oath to be friends,  would lose a child."
Antelope replied,  "It must have been your parent who made the oath. Now it is meant for you!"

One day, as Parna looked after the cows, it suddenly started to rain.
Just at that time, his father's favourite cow, Blackie, gave birth. The calf was the most beautiful calf that Parna had ever seen.
Parna was so happy caring for Blackie and the calf that he forgot about the rest of the cows.
He thought, “Father promised to give the calf to me if it is female.”
As he daydreamed, a strong hand pulled him up. Parna saw Uncle Teteyo and remembered, “Uncle, where are the cows?”
Uncle Teteyo replied, “Your mother found all the cows in the shed, except Blackie, and you. She was afraid so she sent me to fetch you.”
Parna excitedly told his uncle how Blackie gave birth to the beautiful calf. Uncle Teteyo said, “I'll carry the calf as you and Blackie follow.”
Everyone was happy to see Parna, Blackie and the calf safe.
Parna asked his father, “Will you let me have the calf as you promised?”
“Yes, my son, she is all yours. A promise is a promise."
Once upon a time,  there lived two rats.
One rat lived in the town, one lived in the village.
One day,  the rat that lived in the town said to the rat that lived in the village,  "You eat badly and sleep badly too."
We sleep in chief's house. We eat many different kinds of food. Come and visit me and see," said the town rat."
Meanwhile the chief was furious. He cursed,  "These rats that eat my food,  they will see!" This time,  he set a trap with sugar.
The rats came in to eat the goodies in the house. They came laughing,  "Chuchuchichicheche!"
When they reached the trap the town rat said,  "Let me taste this sugar. You see the goodies we eat here."
But before the rat could take the sugar,  the trap snapped,  PA! The trap caught the rat's head,  and his eyes bulged like eggplants.
The village rat just looked,  amazed. He said,  "E. Heee! My friend,  which goodies did you eat that made your eyes bulge?"
But the town rat could not reply.
The village rat left the house saying,  "Haa! I will not manage these goodies you praise."
Your worst home is better than your neighbour's best home.
The drum has always been an important musical instrument in our community. We love drums!We have drums of different sizes: big, medium-sized and small.
We play drums using beaters, or with our fingers. We play drums for various reasons. We play drums with songs and dances, for feasts and in bad times.
Drums enrich songs and make people want to dance. Drums make ceremonies colourful.We play drums during ceremonies for marriage and child naming. We play drums when celebrating a new harvest or a twin birth.
We sound drums to announce grief and call people when death occurs.
We sound drums to call people to clean wells, clear roads, or to build a hut for a needy old person. We sound drums to call people when cattle are stolen in our village.
We sound drums to gather people for meetings at our chief's palace.
Drums call people to go to church for prayers on Sundays, and other prayer days. We also play drums to enrich songs when singing in churches.
The big drum sounds, "An a bul mba, an a bul mba, an a bul mba-mba-mba-mba bul."The small drums sing in their high pitches, "Tindiri, tindiri tindiri ti."Together they chorus, "Tindiri mba, tindiri mba, tindiri mba-mba-mba-mba, tindiri ti!"
Long,  long ago,  the sky god,  Nyame,  kept all stories locked in a wooden box, high in the sky. People down on earth had no stories to tell and they were very sad. They asked Anansi the Spider to help them.
Anansi spun a long thread,  and climbed up his sticky thread all the way to heaven. "Can I have the stories,  please?" he asked the sky god. But Nyame laughed at Anansi and said, "Oh,  these are very expensive stories. You wouldn't be able to pay for them, little spider."
"How much do the stories cost?" asked Anansi. "You'll have to bring me three rare and fierce animals," Nyame answered. "Bring a leopard with sharp teeth like spears, a hornet that stings people, and a snake that swallows people whole," said Nyame, laughing. He thought his stories were quite safe.
So Anansi climbed slowly back down his sticky thread to the earth. He thought and he thought, and he came up with a plan. He dug a deep hole, covered it with branches and dirt so it was hidden. He went home for supper. In the morning, sure enough, a leopard had fallen into his pit. He was furiously scratching at the side of the pit, but he couldn't get out.
"Oh, let me help you,  my dear friend!" said Anansi to the leopard. "Just lie down on these sticks and I'll pull you out." Anansi wound his sticky web round the leopard and the sticks, and pulled him up to heaven to show the sky god. But Nyame just laughed and said,  "Where are the other two?"
Anansi went back to earth to get the second creature. He thought and he thought and he came up with a plan. He filled a gourd with water and picked a banana leaf, and then went to the tree where the hornets lived. He held the banana leaf over his head and poured half the water over himself.
Anansi poured the rest of the water over the hornets' nest. He shouted, "Hey hornets! It is raining! Quick, get inside my gourd and it will keep you dry."Hornets don't like to get wet,  so they all flew into Anansi's gourd.
Anansi quickly spun a web across the opening of the gourd. The hornets couldn't get out, no matter how much they buzzed. He carried the gourd up to heaven and showed the sky god. But Nyame just said,  "Where's the last one?" (He wasn't laughing so much anymore.)
Anansi went down to earth again. He thought and thought and he thought, but he couldn't come up with a plan. So he asked his wife, who had a very good idea. They found a long thick branch and some strong vines. Then, they went to the stream where the snake lived, and began to argue. "The branch is longer!" "No, it isn't!" "Yes it is!"
Soon the snake came out and asked what the argument was. "I was arguing with my wife," said Anansi. "She says this stick is longer than you are. But I don't agree." The snake exclaimed, "Of course I'm longer than that stick! I'm very long! I'm a huge snake! Just put your stick next to me and measure!"
Anansi did that. And to keep the snake straight, Anansi tied him to the stick with the strong vine.After tying up the snake, Anansi took him to the sky god.
Nyame had to admit that Anansi had paid his price. He went to his wooden box, opened the lid, and gave all the stories to Anansi. Anansi carried the stories triumphantly down to earth. He shared them with his wife, and with all the other animals and people. Stories are for telling,  not for keeping in wooden boxes.
It was a little girl who first saw the mysterious shape in the distance.
As the shape moved closer, the girl saw that it was a heavily pregnant woman.
Shy but brave, the little girl moved nearer to the woman. "We must keep her with us," the little girl's people decided. "We'll keep her and her child safe."
The child was soon on its way. Everyone wanted to help. "Push!" "Bring blankets!" "Water!" "Puuuuussssshhh!"
But when they saw the baby, everyone jumped back in shock. "A donkey!"
Everyone began to argue. "We said we would keep mother and child safe, and that's what we'll do," said some. "But they will bring us bad luck!" said others.
And so the woman found herself alone again. She wondered what to do with this awkward child. She wondered what to do with herself.
But finally she had to accept that he was her child and she was his mother. Now, if the child had stayed that same, small size, everything might have been different.
But the donkey child grew and grew until he could no longer fit on his mother's back. And no matter how hard he tried, he could not behave like a human being. His mother was often tired and frustrated. Sometimes she made him do work meant for animals.
Confusion and anger built up inside Donkey. He couldn't do this and he couldn't do that. He couldn't be like this and he couldn't be like that. He became so angry that, one day, he kicked his mother to the ground.
Donkey was filled with shame. He ran away as far and as fast as he could.
By the time he stopped running, it was night, and Donkey was lost. "Hee haw?" he whispered to the darkness. "Hee Haw?" it echoed back. He was all alone. Curling himself into a tight ball, he fell into a deep and troubled sleep.
Donkey woke up to find a strange old man staring down at him. He looked into the old man's eyes and started to feel a twinkle of hope.
Donkey went to stay with the old man, who taught him many different ways to survive. Donkey listened and learned, and so did the old man. They helped each other, and they laughed together.
One morning, the old man asked Donkey to carry him to the top of a mountain.
High up amongst the clouds they fell asleep. Donkey dreamed that his mother was sick and calling to him.
When Donkey woke up, the clouds had disappeared along with his friend, the old man.
Donkey finally knew what to do.
Donkey found his mother, alone and mourning her lost child. They stared at each other for a long time. And then hugged each other very hard.
The donkey child and his mother have grown together and found many ways of living together. Slowly,  all around them, other families have started to settle.

Once, a rabbit thought to itself, "I have been eating raw carrots so far...
"Let me cook and eat it. "
"How do I cook?"
"Let me ask for help in this house"
But, there was a dog that started barking . He also chased the rabbit.
"Oh dear! What do I do now?" thought the rabbit.
He kept the carrots in the sun. The carrots didn't  cook.
He cooked the carrots in the fire. The carrots became too bitter!
"How do I cook and eat this? " Thought the rabbit furiously to himself.
He found a tortoise shell.
He gathered twigs.
He also found stones!
The rabbit lit the stove.
He also invited his friends to eat.
Everybody enjoyed eating the finely cooked carrots!
Anansi the Spider, and Rabbit were friends. They lived in a peaceful village in the mountains. Rabbit owned a big farm with lots of vegetables and fruit. Even though Rabbit shared generously with his friend, Anansi was unhappy and jealous.
So Anansi thought of a clever plan to take over Rabbit's farm. Soon Rabbit was left poor and homeless. Anansi was the proud owner of all Rabbit's land, vegetables, and fruit.
Anansi went to the market to sell his fruit and vegetables. He made so much money that he filled a big basket with it! With some of the money, he bought maize for his family, and put it on top of the money in the basket.
Anansi happily headed home with his basket on his head, singing. He was thinking about all the things he was going to buy with his money.
On the way, it started to drizzle. Soon the drizzle turned into a heavy downpour. Anansi the Spider left his basket on the side of the road to shelter under a tree. But from there he kept a close watch on his precious basket.
It started to rain even more heavily, and Anansi was getting cold and wet. So he ran into a hole. "I will stay in this hole until the rain stops," said Anansi to himself. "At least my money is protected by the maize I put on top of it."
A little while later, Vulture was flying around and spotted the basket on the side of the road. He saw that there was money and maize in the basket. So he covered the basket with his wings and waited for the rain to stop.
Anansi saw Vulture sitting on his basket. "Oh thank you, my friend, for protecting my basket," he said to the Vulture. "Excuse me, Anansi, did I hear you right?" asked Vulture. "Your basket? This basket is mine! I found it here on the road side!" Anansi could not believe his ears! "It's mine, I tell you!"
Furious, Anansi went and reported the theft to the chief. But Vulture said to the chief and his elders, "How could anyone leave a basket full of money and maize unguarded on the road?" "But I was watching my basket," said Anansi. "It's my money and my maize!" "I was looking after the basket when you came and said it was yours!" replied Vulture.
When the chief and his elders had listened carefully to both sides, they sent Anansi and Vulture away. They discussed the story for a long time. Eventually they reached a decision.
They summoned Anansi and the Vulture again. "We believe Vulture's story," they said. "He is not the thief. You were trying to claim something that was not yours." Anansi could not believe his ears! He burst into tears.
The news soon spread that the judgement had gone against Anansi. As he walked away, he heard Rabbit laughing and laughing. Rabbit went back to his farm and grew fruit and vegetables. But Anansi was poor again, with no friends.
One day Tortoise was walking through the veld. He was looking for something. He gazed into the distance and squinted at the grass. Then he walked past Snail.
Snail said,  "No,  I haven't,  but I'll help you look!" She climbed onto Tortoise's shell. Tortoise walked on with Snail on his back. They looked and looked,  but there was no sign of a house. The sun was high in the sky.
A little later they passed Sparrow. "Are you looking for something?" asked Sparrow. "Yes,  Sparrow,  I'm looking for my house. Have you seen it,  by any chance?" Sparrow said,  "No,  I haven't,  but I'll help you look!"
He flapped his wings and he whizzed away. "But you're going too fast for me," complained Tortoise. Sparrow came back. "Alright,  then I'll hop on too."
Tortoise carried on,  with Snail and Sparrow perched on his shell. They looked and looked,  but there was no sign of a house. The sun had inched lower in the sky.
A little later they passed Ladybird. "Are you looking for something?" asked Ladybird. "Yes,  Ladybird,  I'm looking for my house. Have you seen it,  by any chance?"
Ladybird said,  "No,  I haven't,  but I'll help you look!" She hopped onto Tortoise's back and on he went,  with Snail and Sparrow and Ladybird on his back. They looked and looked,  but there was no sign of a house. A breeze started to blow.
A little later they passed Mouse. He was making a garland of daisies. "Are you looking for something?" asked Mouse. "Yes,  Mouse,  I'm looking for my house. Have you seen it,  by any chance?"
Mouse said: "No,  I haven't,  but I'll help you look!" She hopped onto Tortoise's back. "Wait,  I can't leave my flowers behind." Tortoise waited. Mouse stretched and stretched and scooped up her daisies.
Tortoise walked on,  with Snail and Sparrow and Ladybird and Mouse on his back. They looked and looked,  but there was no sign of a house. The wind swept leaves off the ground and swirled them around Tortoise's feet. He was tired. "You lot are heavy," he sighed.
The wind got stronger. The sky turned dark. "Oh,  where is my house?" asked Tortoise. Thunder roared in the hills. Lightning flashed in the distance. Drip-drip came the rain.
The wind whirled and whipped. It blew Snail and Sparrow and Ladybird and Mouse right off Tortoise's back.
And then came the hail,  tip-tip-tip. Tortoise got such a fright he shrank into his shell. It was warm and cosy in there. "Oh,  here is my house!" smiled Tortoise.
"Oh,  here is Tortoise's house!" said Snail and Robin and Mouse.
Hamisi needs a new school uniform. His dad takes him to the market.
Hamisi sees a boy wearing a beautiful shirt. "That is a very fine shirt," thinks Hamisi.
"Dad, I wish I had a shirt like the one that boy has," says Hamisi.
"Look, there are those beautiful shirts," says Hamisi. "Dad, please buy one for me."
"Hamisi, I have to buy your uniform," says dad.
"I do not have enough money for that shirt," says dad.
Hamisi's dad buys the uniform. He is surprised when he gets the change. He has enough money left over to buy a shirt for Hamisi!
It is Hamisi's lucky day! Which shirt will he choose?
वाघमारे काकाचा तो वार्षिक केशकर्तन दिवस होता.   It was the Annual Haircut Day for Waghmare Kaka.
वाघमारे काका न्हाव्याकडे जाण्यासाठी घरात निघाले. Waghmare Kaka left home to go to the barber.
पण न्हावी म्हणाला, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.''But the barber said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
वाघमारे काका दुःखी झाले. ते मदत मागण्यासाठी आपल्या बायको कडे गेले.Waghmare Kaka felt sad. He went to his wife to ask for help.
पण त्यांची बायको म्हणाली, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.''   But his wife said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
थोडा रागवून, वाघमारे काका आपल्या शिंपी मित्राकडे गेले. Feeling a little angry, Waghmare Kaka went to his friend, the tailor.
पण शिंपी म्हणाला, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.'' But the tailor said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
वाघमारे काका आणखी एका मित्राकडे गेले, सुताराकडे. Waghmare Kaka went to one more friend, the carpenter.
पण सुतार म्हणाला, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.'' But the carpenter said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
बिचारे वाघमारे काका. वार्षिक केशकर्तन दिवशी त्यांचे केस कोणीच कापू शकणार नव्हते. Poor Waghmare Kaka. No one could cut his hair on this Annual             Haircut Day.
रडत रडत,  ते गावाजवळच्या जंगलात पोहोचले. Crying, he went to the forest near the village.
ते एका गुहेजवळ बसून जोरात रडायला लागले. He sat near a cave and cried loudly.
''देवा, मदत कर! कोण माझे केस कापतील?'' “Oh God, help me! Who will cut my hair?”
गुहेत शांतपणे झोपलेला वाघ त्याच्या आवाजाने जागा झाला. The tiger sleeping peacefully inside the cave was awake now.
ते वाघ जोराने गरजला आणि वाघमारे काकांवर उडी मारली!  The tiger roared loudly and jumped on Waghmare Kaka!
बिचारे वाघमारे काका इतके घाबरले, इतके घाबरले, इतके घाबरले  की ... Poor Waghmare Kaka was so scared, so scared, so scared that ...
... त्यांच्या डोक्यावरचे सगळेच केस गळून पडले! ... all the hair fell off his head!
वाघमारे काका धावत गावात आले. वाघ पुन्हा झोपायला गेला.Waghmare Kaka ran all the way back to the village.                                   The tiger went back to sleep.
आता वाघमारे काकाला खूप दिवस केस कापण्याची गरज येणारच नाही. Now, Waghmare Kaka will not need a haircut for a very long time.

Long time ago, Magezi and Kasiira lived by sharing food.
Magezi said, "Let us dig together the way we eat together."
Magezi told Kasiira, "You dig and I will plant."
Magezi told Kasiira, "You plant and I will weed."
When the millet was ripe, Kasiira asked Magezi to harvest it.
Magezi said, "You harvest, I will put it in the granary."
Magezi was lazy.So Kasiira gave him only one millet finger.

Long ago, animals had no legs.
Maguru had given legs only to people.
Maguru decided to give legs to every animal.
The animals wanted legs to walk and run.
It was hard for them to crawl.
When the day came, different animals crawled to Maguru's house.
Maguru gave legs to animals and birds.
Some animals danced, while others fell down.
They said, "We will never crawl again."
Millipede was the last animal on the line.
Maguru gave Millipede all the remaining legs.
Millipede said happily, “I will move faster than others.”
After Millipede, Snake came begging, “Please give me some legs.”
Snake said to Maguru, "I over-slept."
Maguru did not find any legs for Snake.
From that day, Snake still waits to get legs.
One morning, Miss Goat was grazing in the field. “Why is it is so hot this early in the year?” thought Miss Goat.
“I must find some shade, away from this blazing heat,” thought Miss Goat. She bit off a lotus leaf and took shelter under it.
But soon, the lotus leaf withered in the heat. Miss Goat tried to take shelter under a banana leaf, but the afternoon sun was so strong that the banana leaf withered too.
Miss Goat ran to the jungle to make a shelter of tree branches. But, a hot wind blew away all the leaves!
Miss Goat saw some villagers building a house. “I must learn how to build a strong house like that one,” she thought.
After watching the villagers for a while, Miss Goat knew what she had to do. She gathered tree branches.She gathered banana leaves.
Miss Goat dug holes for the tree branches. Then she spread the banana leaves over the tree branches and tied them tightly together. She worked so hard, she was now hotter than ever!
Just as she finished, the hot wind began to blow.But this time, the wind could not blow the banana leaves away!
Miss Goat settled inside her home. “I'm not hot any more!” she thought happily. "Now, I just need a nap."
Knock! Knock!
"Who is there?" I ask sleepily.
"It is me," a shrill voice says.
"Who is 'me'?" I ask.
"I told you,  it is o-n-l-y m-e," the same voice says.
"I don't know anyone called,  'o-n-l-y m-e'," I reply. I check that my mosquito net is tucked in around my bed.
"Well, my name is Amos." The voice sounds more shrill than before. It is very close to my ear.
"Amos who?" I ask as I look under the net.
"Amos Quito," the voice finally says. I feel a bite on my ear.
"Ouch!" I jump up and begin to search. "You will pay for this!" I shout.
Angrily, I get out of bed and switch on the light.
I declare war on the annoying Amos Quito!
It was a bright moonlit night. All the animals in Mangu's farm were sleeping. Except Tinku!
“I am not sleepy, Ma,” murmured Tinku. But Ma did not hear him. She was fast asleep. He turned left, and he turned right. He lay on his tummy, and rolled on his back. But he could not sleep!
So he set off into the night to see what he could find. Up in the sky, Tinku saw the moon, white and round, smiling down at him. He felt very happy.‘Night is beautiful,’ thought Tinku.
Far away on the top of a tree, there were some tiny lights. One spot of light flew down! “I’m a firefly,” said the spot of light. “I glow in the dark!”“Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku.“Yes, I will!” said the firefly.
Something flew by and hung upside down on a tree. “What is your name, bird?” asked Tinku.“I am not a bird, I am a bat. I can see during the night!” said the bat.“Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku.“Yes, I will!” said the bat.
A few leaves moved in the bushes. Someone was hiding! “Who are you?” asked Tinku.“I am a fox,” said the fox. “I go strolling out at night.”“Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku.“Yes, I will!” said the fox.
Two shiny eyes looked at him from a tree. “Who are you?” asked Tinku.“I’m an owl,” said the owl. “I hunt for food during the night.”“Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku.“Yes, I will!” said the owl.
“CHIRRRRRP! CHIRRRRRP!”“Who is here?” Tinku asked.“I’m a cricket,” said the cricket. “I chirp when it is dark.”“Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku.“Yes, I will!” said the cricket.
Tinku and his friends jumped and tossed and rolled until Tinku yawned. “I am sleepy. I have to go home now,” said Tinku. He was happy that he had many new friends. Snuggling close to Ma, he said, “Night is not a lonely place, Ma. Night is full of wonderful beings.”“Yes!” replied Ma. “Your new friends are nocturnal, just like wild dogs.”
“Nocturnal animals eat, play and work at night. They rest during the day. You must sleep now. Sleep will give you energy to play with your day-time friends tomorrow. Good night, little one!” she said, hugging him tight.
The bright round moon shone all night long, spreading her calm light all around. And Tinku slept all through the night!

This house is in Congo. I like this house.
We had our own bathroom.We had our own toilet.
We had a garden. I was planting my own garden.
My mother told me, "My mother taught me to plant. Now I am teaching you."
I planted tomatoes and spinach. I did it alone.
I would take tomatoes to my mother.She would say, "Thank you."
We have no garden here in South Africa.
The bus stop in my town was full of people.
The bus conductor shouted, “Going to the city! Leaving now!”
People pushed to get on the bus.
Women with children sat down.The journey was going to be long.
I sat at the window, next to a man.
I thought, “I am going to the big city! I will miss home.”
There were many hawkers selling their goods.
Some passengers bought things. I had no money to buy anything.
Suddenly, the driver blew the horn. It was time to leave.
The hawkers pushed each other to get out of the bus.
“When will I return?” I asked myself.
It was hot inside the bus. I closed my eyes.
I thought about my mother and brother at home.
Gradually, I fell fast asleep.
Many hours later, I woke up. Almost everyone had left.
It was time to find my uncle’s house.
An old woman had chickens and an old rooster.
Her grandson visited her. She decided to kill the old rooster.
The old rooster ran away to the big city.
The old rooster met the cat running away from her boss.
The old rooster and the cat met the dog running away.
They were joined by a horse which was running away too.
The animals came to a house. They saw thieves inside!
The animals sang loudly to chase away the thieves.
They ate the food they found in the house.
The thieves returned later. The animals attacked them.
The thieves ran away forever.
The animals lived together happily in the house.

One day, Kalabushe’s aunt fell ill.
That evening, Kalabushe took food to her sick aunt.
Kalabushe met a hyena who had changed into a person.
Kalabushe told him, “I am carrying meat, eggs and milk.”
The hyena licked his lips as he thought about meat.
The hyena ran ahead of Kalabushe to her aunt’s house.
He swallowed Kalabushe’s aunt. He covered himself with her blanket.
Kalabushe arrived and called out, “Aunt, where are you?”
Kalabushe saw someone covered with a big blanket.
Kalabushe asked, “Aunt, why are your ears so big today?”
“Aunt, why are your eyes so big?”
“Aunt, why is your mouth big?” The hyena swallowed her!
Kalabushe kept asking questions while inside the hyena’s stomach.
He became tired of Kalabushe’s questions. He spat her out.
Kalabushe and her aunt were rescued by the villagers.
When Simbegwire's mother died,  she was very sad. Simbegwire's father did his best to take care of his daughter. Slowly,  they learned to feel happy again,  without Simbegwire's mother. Every morning they sat and talked about the day ahead. Every evening they made dinner together. After they washed the dishes,  Simbegwire's father helped her with homework.
One day,  Simbegwire's father came home later than usual. "Where are you my child?" he called. Simbegwire ran to her father. She stopped still when she saw that he was holding a woman's hand. "I want you to meet someone special,  my child. This is Anita," he said smiling.
"Hello Simbegwire,  your father told me a lot about you," said Anita. But she did not smile or take the girl's hand. Simbegwire's father was happy and excited. He talked about the three of them living together,  and how good their life would be. "My child,  I hope you will accept Anita as your mother," he said.
Simbegwire's life changed. She no longer had time to sit with her father in the mornings. Anita gave her so many household chores that she was too tired to do her school work in the evenings. She went straight to bed after dinner. Her only comfort was the colourful blanket her mother gave her. Simbegwire's father did not seem to notice that his daughter was unhappy.
After a few months,  Simbegwire's father told them that he would be away from home for a while. "I have to travel for my job," he said. "But I know you will look after each other." Simbegwire's face fell,  but her father did not notice. Anita did not say anything. She was not happy either.
Things got worse for Simbegwire. If she didn't finish her chores,  or she complained,  Anita hit her. And at dinner,  the woman ate most of the food,  leaving Simbegwire with only a few scraps. Each night Simbegwire cried herself to sleep,  hugging her mother's blanket.
One morning,  Simbegwire was late getting out of bed. "You lazy girl!" Anita shouted. She pulled Simbegwire out of bed. The precious blanket caught on a nail,  and tore in two.
Simbegwire was very upset. She decided to run away from home. She took the pieces of her mother's blanket,  packed some food,  and left the house. She followed the road her father had taken.
When it came to evening,  she climbed a tall tree near a stream and made a bed for herself in the branches. As she went to sleep,  she sang: Maama,  maama,  maama,  you left me. You left me and never came back. Father doesn't love me anymore. Mother,  when are you coming back? You left me.
The next morning,  Simbegwire sang the song again. When the women came to wash their clothes at the stream,  they heard the sad song coming from the tall tree. They thought it was only the wind rustling the leaves,  and carried on with their work. But one of the women listened very carefully to the song.
This woman looked up into the tree. When she saw the girl and the pieces of colourful blanket,  she cried,  "Simbegwire,  my brother's child!" The other women stopped washing and helped Simbegwire to climb down from the tree. Her aunt hugged the little girl and tried to comfort her.
Simbegwire's aunt took the child to her own house. She gave Simbegwire warm food,  and tucked her in bed with her mother's blanket. That night,  Simbegwire cried as she went to sleep. But they were tears of relief. She knew her aunt would look after her.
When Simbegwire's father returned home,  he found her room empty. "What happened,  Anita?" he asked with a heavy heart. The woman explained that Simbegwire had run away. "I wanted her to respect me," she said. "But perhaps I was too strict." Simbegwire's father left the house and went in the direction of the stream. He continued to his sister's village to find out if she has seen Simbegwire.
Simbegwire was playing with her cousins when she saw her father from far away. She was scared he might be angry,  so she ran inside the house to hide. But her father went to her and said,  "Simbegwire,  you have found a perfect mother for yourself. One who loves you and understands you. I am proud of you and I love you." They agreed that Simbegwire would stay with her aunt as long as she wanted to.
Her father visited her every day. Eventually,  he came with Anita. She reached out for Simbegwire's hand. "I'm so sorry little one,  I was wrong," she cried. "Will you let me try again?" Simbegwire looked at her father and his worried face. Then she stepped forward slowly and put her arms around Anita.
The next week,  Anita invited Simbegwire,  with her cousins and aunt,  to the house for a meal. What a feast! Anita prepared all of Simbegwire's favourite foods,  and everyone ate until they were full. Then the children played while the adults talked. Simbegwire felt happy and brave. She decided that soon,  very soon,  she would return home to live with her father and her stepmother.
Satyacan’t stay still.   Heruns and jumps and spins and rolls......and falls!
"Sitquietly for a minute!" says Appa.  "Ifyou get hurt, don’t come crying to me," says Akka.
"Don’tyou dare break anything!" says Thaatha.  "You'redisturbing the class," says his teacher.
Butwhat can Satya do if his hands and legs are always dancing?
Today is Sunday. It’s Satya’s favourite day of the week — the day he goes to the farm where Amma works.
It’s a long walk to the farm, through secret up-and-down paths, open fields, thick forests and gently flowing streams.
Satya hops like a hare and sprints like a deer.  "The mud is squishy. Be careful!" says Amma.
He crawls like a centipede and slithers like a snake."Look out for thorns!" says Amma.
He swings like a spider and leaps like a langur."Wheeeee!""Use the strong branches, my little monkey," says Amma.
He paddles like a duck and  swims like a frog."Stay in the shallows, okay?" says Amma.
He climbs like a lizard and jumps like a goat."Don’t slip!" says Amma.
Satya flaps his arms like wings and tries to fly away. He imagines himself soaring and gliding like a vulture.
Late in the evening, when the sun sets and crickets begin to hum, it’s time to go home.Tired Satya climbs on to his mother's back. They return through the up-and-down paths, fields, forests and streams.
Athome, Appa, Akka and Thaatha take one look at bruised and muddySatya, and burst into laughter.
Thaatha bathes him.Appa cooks him dinner.Akka tells him his favourite story as he falls asleep.
Inhis dreams, Satya runs and jumps and spins and rolls...
... andflies away!
Howdo they move?Oh, the way Satya moves! Did you know that animals, birds and insects also move in many different ways and for different reasons?Like us, they move mainly to finddelicious food, a cozy home and a warm family. Some of them also moveto escape from being caught and eaten by other animals.Find out how some of thesecreatures move!
Dolphins are famous for how they leap out of water. Can you leap?Cheetahs are the fastest landanimals. They can run really fast and sprint too, especially whenthey hunt. Can you sprint?
Crabs can walk sideways. Can youwalk sideways?Grasshoppers can jump reallyhigh, especially when they want to escape from being eaten. Can youjump really high?Snails crawl. Slowly. Very, very slowly. Can you crawl slowly?
One day,  Manu was walking.
At that time,  a lion was resting in the grass.
Manu was full of fear.
The lion woke up.
Manu climbed a tall tree.
The lion waited for Manu under the tree.
Manu fell asleep.
He fell down from the tree.
The lion ran away.
Manu started to run in the same direction as the lion.
When he realised,  he changed and run away.
Once upon a time, there lived a happy family.
The children never fought with each other. They helped their parents at home and in the fields.
But they were not allowed to go near a fire.
They had to do all their work during the night. Because they were made of wax!
But one of the boys longed to go out in the sunlight.
One day the longing was too strong. His brother and sister warned him.
But it was too late! He melted in the hot sun.
The wax children cried to see their brother melting away.
But they made a plan. They shaped the lump of melted wax into a bird.
They took their bird brother up to a high mountain.
And as the sun rose, he flew away, singing in the morning light.
﻿We love going to Grandmother's village!
In Granny's garden stands a big mango tree.So many birds come and perch on it.
I like hiding on this tree.Nobody can find me here.
Dad searches for me near the well, and Mom searches near the cowshed.However, none of them find me.
Oh no!Granny's dog has found me.
Now I must climb down.Granny hugs me tightly.
Why is the baby crying?
I think she is hungry.
Why is the boy sad?
I think he is missing his father.
Why is the girl happy?
She has a new dress.
Why is the old man laughing?
He read a good joke.
Why is the lady smiling?
Her children are reading quietly.
What is this lady feeling?I think she is feeling shy.
Once upon a time,  there was a father who had two sons.
One day,  he called his sons and said,  "I am old and will die soon. But before I die,  I want to see you in your own homes. You have one month to each make your own home. I want to see you back here after the month."
The two sons rushed out. The first one went to the roadside. He cut down trees and began to build a big compound for himself.
The second one,  however,  went out and started forming special relationships with other families. He went to different people,  and he became like their foster child.
After a month,  the two brothers came back to their father. The father said,  "Well,  have you built your homes?" And both of the brothers said,  "Yes."
The father went with his eldest son. He saw that the son had built many huts. As he walked by each hut,  he asked,  "Is there anybody in this hut?" Each time,  the son replied,  "No."
The father would ask,  "Is there anybody in this hut?" And the son would reply,  "No."
The father became hungry,  but there was no one to serve food to him. He said,  "Let's go home." So they went home.
The second brother took them to the first family he had adopted. He introduced them,  "Here is my father and my brother." The family welcomed the men. They slaughtered a sheep and gave them a big feast.
They went to the second family the younger son had adopted. He introduced his father and brother and they were given another feast.
Father and brother were welcomed in all the places where the younger son was adopted. They ate and were satisfied. Then they left for home.
The father said,  "This is what I meant when I said you should make yourself a home. A home is more than many huts or a big expensive house. It is love,  warmth and friendship with other people."
I love to play soccer. I love to play soccer with Thando, Nhlanhla and Ben.
This is my mum.I love my mum. She makes me laugh.
I love God, because God created me.
I love school, because the teachers teach me what I need to know.
I love to play with dogs, because it is fun.
I love birthdays, because I like to celebrate.
And I love myself because …
… because … I do!
“I have a wigglytooth, Mama!”                                                             This is Bunu’sfirst loose tooth.                                                             She is excited, but also a little scared.
"Push it with your tongue,” Mama says.Bunu pushed and pushed and pushed.“It is not ready,” Mama says. “Wait for some time and it will fall out on its own.”
Bunu goes to Papa. “Papa,” Bunu says.“I have a wiggly tooth!”Papa shakes the tooth gently.  "It is notready,” he says. "Wait for some time  and it will fall out on itsown."
But Bunu does not want to wait. She runs to her room with a long piece of string.She ties one end of the string around her tooth and the other around the door knob.
Bunu sits on the floor and waits and waits and waits.
Finally Bunu gets tired of waiting and waiting and waiting.She unties the string from the door and sits on her bed with a loud sigh.
Chunnu, her sister,walks in after some time. “That was a terribleidea,” she says, pointing at the door. “Why don’t I pull the string, and yourtooth will come out like that?”
Chunnu snapped herfingers. Bunu closes her eyesand opens her mouth. "One, two,three!" Chunnu pulls."OWWW!” Bunu screams. "It is notready,” Chunnu says."Wait for some time and it will fall out on itsown."
“This tooth willnever come out!” Bunu says."When we weresmall, we would throw our teeth on theroof and ask Musa to give us his inreturn,” says Mama. “Because we wanted teeth as strong as a mouse’s.”Bunu runs out andcries, “Musa, Musa!Here is my big strong tooth for you.If you like it, pleasecome and take it away!”
That night, Bunudreams of a big mouse. Musa is holdingsomething gleaming between his teeth. He stops and staresat her, then scurries away into a hole.
As soon as Bunu wakes up, she pushes the tooth with her tongue.But there is nothing there!Did she swallow it? Did someone pull it out when she was sleeping? Where is it?There it is! Right next to the pillow. Bunu picks the tooth up and dashes outside.
“Musa, Musa, pleasetake my tooth and give me a new one!” she says.She throws hertooth on the roofand runs back inside to tell Mama.
Heeeee! There is a beautiful cow at home.
It has only one horn,  and no tail.
It is fat,  with a big stomach.
It is a powerful cow.
The shepherd loves this cow the most.
When the other cattle graze,  this one eats alone.
This cow is a fighter. Other cows leave it alone.
If you met such a cow,  what would you do?
Where is my cat?
Is it under the bed?
Is it on top of the cupboard?
Is it behind the couch?
Is it next to the bin?
Is it inside the basket?
Is it outside the house?
Here it is!
Fana and her family live in a busy town.
Fana has a cat, two hens, a goat and a dove.
One day, Fana saw other children throwing stones at doves.
Fana ran towards the children. She shouted, “Stop throwing stones.”
Fana took the two doves home to look after them.
She fed them and told her family how she saved them.
Fana and her parents took the doves to the clinic.
Fana tells her friends, “Animals are our friends. We protect them.”
Long ago, there was a clever cat and a foolish dog. The clever cat lived well in a wealthy family's house. The foolish dog starved on the street.
"How is it that a wealthy family allows you to live in their house?" the foolish dog angrily asked the clever cat.
The clever cat replied, "I live with people because I'm neat and I bury my waste. I ask for food saying, meow."
"If I do the same, will they allow me to live in a house?" asked the dog. The cat replied, "Yes, do what I have told you and they will allow you. They will give you food."
The foolish dog said, "Today, I will not hurt you." "He almost got me this time. I don't want to meet him again," said the cat, jumping away.
Based on the cat's advice, the foolish dog barked loudly at the door of a house.
The owners of the house beat him with a stick. "The cat fooled me. I will eat her when I get her," shouted the foolish dog.
While the cat was playing outside her house, the dog grabbed her. He said, "Last time you fooled me. You told me to bark at the gate of a house. The owners beat me. Now I will eat you."
"Listen dog, you can eat me, but let me play a little first. Just as I allow a rat to play before I eat her," replied the clever cat.
The dog asked, "How does the rat play?" The cat replied, "I let it go a little, and I tell it to count to three. While the rat is counting, I grab it."
The foolish dog let the cat go free and told her to count to three. The clever cat escaped and climbed up a tree. "Come down from the tree and count to three," asked the dog.
The clever cat answered, "Listen dog, you will never get me again. I'm not a fool. You can count to a hundred, a thousand or a million but you will never get me again!"
In my village,  lives Mister Kio. Mister Kio has a cat called Safi.
When Mister Kio goes to work,  he leaves the door open.
Safi sits in the doorway to watch over the house.
When the neighbour's dog comes close,  Safi scares him away.
The dog runs away.
When a neighbour knocks at the door,  Safi is ready to scratch.
The neighbour turns and runs away.
When Safi is hungry,  she closes the door.
Safi eats her food.
Afterwards,  Safi jumps onto the sofa and sleeps,  "Purr! Purr! Purr!"
When Mister Kio returns,  Safi stretches happily and welcomes him home.
Mister Kio and Safi sit down,  and each of them reads the newspaper.

Today,we will climb up a ladder together. It is a rather unusual ladder. Inthis ladder, the distance between the rungs gets bigger and BIGGER and BIGGER as you climb up the steps, growing 10 times at each step. Sometimes we will climb one step at a time and at other times we will skip many steps at one go.Thefunny thing is that we are not even sure which the last step is orwhether the steps go on forever. Let the exciting journey begin!
Step0: 1 metreWhatdo a five year old boy, a cricket bat and a newborn baby elephanthave in common? All of them have a height of about 1 metre (or 1m forshort)! It would be awkward to say that the ceiling of a room is 3baby elephants high. So we make the sensible choice of saying thatthe height of the ceiling is 3 metres.
Step1: 10 metresNowthat you have a feel for the size of one metre, we are ready to climbto the next step of our ladder, at 10 metres. A three storey buildingor a mango tree is roughly 10 metres high. A cricket pitch is abouttwice that length. Canyou think of other objects that are about 10 m long or high?
Step2: 100 metresHaveyou noticed that with every step we add a zero to the right of thenumber we had before and the step number matches the number ofzeroes? Keep track of that as we climb along. Ifyou have run the 100m race on school sports day, or watched sprintersdo it on TV, you know exactly how far that is. Now imagine if the100m track stood up! That would be about the height of two GolGumbaz*-es. *TheGol Gumbaz in Bijapur, Karnataka, is the tomb of Mohammed Adil Shah.When it was built in 1656, it had the largest dome in the world. Itheld the record until 1881!
Step3: 1000 metresThousandmetres has a special name - it is called 1 kilometre or 1 km. Youwould cover this distance if you ran the 100 metre race 10 times -phew!  You would need to climb about 9 km to reach the top of MountEverest.
Step6: 10,00,000 metres Nowlet's skip 2 steps and go to step 6, which has six zeroes to theright of 1.Thedistance from the northern tip of India in Kashmir to the southerntip at Kanyakumari is about 4 times this distance, or 4 times10,00,000 m, or 40,00,000 m. Because 40,00,000 m is quite a mouthful,we usually say 4000 km, which is the same thing.
Step8: 10,00,00,000 metresHowfar away is the bright, beautiful moon? It is right there on the 8thstep of our distance ladder at about 4 times 10,00,00,000 m, or4,00,000 km away from the earth!
Step11: 1,00,00,00,00,000 metresLetus skip two more steps and race to the blazing hot Sun. How far awayis it? It is about 10,00,00,000 km PLUS another5,00,00,000 km. That is very, VERY far away indeed!Butthe far, far away sun still lights up the world and makes us sweat insummer. Amazing, isn't it?
LastStep???Isthere a last step on the ladder? We don’t know yet!  But withpowerful telescopes, scientists have been able to see way beyond thesun. The farthest object that they have been able to spot is on the26thstep, 10,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 m away! That is SERIOUSLY FAR!Maybewhen you grow up, you can discover something even further away, onthe 28th or 29th step. Isn’t that an exciting thought?
Fun with MeasuringThe following activity done in a classroom setting is a greatway to give children a feel for large distances and can engage the childreneither in a single group, or in teams. 1. Ask the children to cut long strips (each about an inchwide) from old newspapers.  2. Ask them to stick the strips end to end with tape or glueto make longer strips, until they get a strip that is 1 metre long (they canuse a measuring tape for this).  3.  Now ask thechildren to use this 1 m long strip as a measure and make 10 similar strips andstick them end to end to make a 10 m long strip. They can lie down next to thisstrip, head to head and feet to feet, and see how many of them it takes to make10 m.  4. They can then stick ten 10 m strips together to make a 100m strip that goes round the classroom many times.  5. What about a 1 km strip? How many times does that goaround the classroom? Which team was able to create a 1 km long strip fastest?
Notes for Parents & Teachers: - When writing down big numbers with lots of zeroes after the 1, it is very easy for children - and adults! - to make mistakes. That is why the 'Powers of 10' notation is such a useful thing. Through this book, children can be taught how to use it - all they need to do is to count the number of zeroes to the right of the 1, and write that number as a superscript of 10. For instance, 1000, which has 3 zeroes after the 1, can be written as 103. And 10000000 (7 zeroes after the 1), can be compactly written as 107. Simple! - In this book, we stopped our 'How far is far?' game at the Sun. If you want to take the game further, you may want to bring in the nearest star beyond the Sun, Proxima Centauri, which is 1016 m away from the Sun. Or the distance from one end of the Milky Way to another, which is 1,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 (or 1021) m! - One thing you should know is that the distances that are given in the book are approximate, not exactly accurate. For example, 3984 km is given as 4000 km. This is not 'unscientific'. Rough estimates are very useful in science! Maybe you can do an activity with the kids to emphasize this. Is the length of a pencil closer to 101 cm or 102 cms? Is the weight of the school bus closer to 103 kgs or 104 kgs? Let the children come up with their own questions for their classmates too.
My friend gave me beans from her garden.
I plant a bean in the soil.
The bean germinates in the soil.
The seedling grows up to the sun.The root grows down.
The seedling sprouts above the soil.
The seedling grows,
and grows.
I plant more beans.
The plants grow,
and grow.
The plants produce bean pods.
The plants grow up, up, over my wall!
I pick the bean pods when they are dry.
I collect the beans from the pods.
I cook the beans with red onion and herbs.
These beans are ready to eat.

Sam is ready to go to town this morning."The bus is only due at 9 o'clock," smiles mother. Sam is two hours early!
Sam and his mother get to the bus stop at 8:45am.
More people came to the bus stop just before 9am.Half an hour later they are all still waiting.
Sam is worried. "Maybe the bus broke down," he thinks. "Maybe we won't go to town today. Maybe I won't get my new school uniform."
At 9:45am some people give up and go home. Sam starts to cry. "We will wait a bit longer," says his mother.
Suddenly, they hear a noise. The bus is coming!
The bus arrives at the stop at 10 o'clock.
"Get in! Get in!" calls the driver. "We are very late today!"
People get on the bus and sit down.The bus leaves the stop at 10:10am.
"What time is the return bus this afternoon?" asks Sam's mother."The blue bus leaves town at 2:30pm," replies the driver.
Sam thinks, "We will get to town at 11 o'clock.""How much time will we have in town before the return bus?" wonders Sam.
It was a beautiful summer day in the Forest-By-The-Sea in the glorious land of Somewheristan. Whales danced in the waves, singing to each other. Sea lions, their smooth brown bodies glistening in the sun, played peek-a-boo with the noisy seagulls, barking and scolding. Every creature in the Forest was happy, happy, happy.
Excuse me! you say. That can’t be true. There’s NEVER a time when EVERY creature ANYwhere is happy, happy, happy. Hmmm. Maybe you’re right. Maybe not EVERY creature was happy. This journalist bear, for instance. In this picture, Bear is trying to smile, but he has a great sorrow. He simply cannot find a ‘BREAKING NEWS’ story. He even sent Bird to look - because Bird moves faster and sees better - but Bird came back with nothing.
‘BREAKING NEWS’ stories are about anger and fear and hate and greed, and there was none of that in the Forest. Everything was happy, happy, happy. A journalist bear without a ‘BREAKING NEWS’ story doesn’t deserve to be a journalist bear, thought Bear sadly to himself. He should be a Waiter Bear, or a Sweeper Bear, or a Telephone Voice Bear, saying, ‘Please check the number you have dialled’, or ‘Kindly wait - you are in a queue’.
He packed his things and started walking to the bus-stop, when Singing Sardarji popped out from behind a tree.
“Arrey oh Journalist Bear!” said Sardarji. “Going somewhere?” “Don’t call me that or I will cry,” said Bear, and told Sardarji he was leaving to become a Telephone Voice Bear. “Don’t be such a silly bear, Bear!” scolded Sardarji. He pulled out a guitar and began to sing.“If Tweety birds stop tweeting, and Hooty Owls stop hooting, the world would be a sad playyyy-ce, don’t you see?”
“Don’t you seeeeeeee?” sang the Tweety Birds and the Hooty Owls. “If Singing Sardarjis don’t, and Journalist Bears won’t, the world would be a bad playyyyy-ce, don’t you see?” sang Sardarji.
“I do enjoy being a Journalist Bear,” Bear said sadly. “I do love finding out things, and talking to people, and writing their stories, but I also do NOT have a ‘BREAKING NEWS’ story, which means...” ‘A-HA!’ said Singing Sardarji. “What?” said Bear, puzzled. “You like finding out things! And talking to people! And writing their stories! You are a Journalist Bear, Bear, but you have the soul of a... drumroll please... Writer Bear!”
Bear beamed. Sardarji was right! He really WAS a Writer Bear. “Tell you what, Bear,” Sardarji went on, “let’s travel the world, you and I. I will sing, and you, Bear, will write. Not 'BREAKING NEWS' stories - no one remembers those after three days, anyway - but real stories of real people, stories that will never grow old.” “Hurray!” said Bear.
And that was how Writer Bear and Singing Sardarji set out to explore the world. Everywhere they went, Sardarji sang to the people, and Bear listened to them. Over time, Bear wrote many, many stories. Happy stories that made people cry, funny stories that made them think, sad stories that made them hope, and scary stories that made them laugh. And Storyweavers all over the world picked up the long, strong, shining threads of Bear's stories, and wove them into new and wonderful stories for all of us to enjoy.
#6FrameStoryChallenge: A Carnival of ArtThe illustrations in this book were created as part of the #6FrameStoryChallenge, an online campaign run by Pratham Books to build a rich bank of illustrations for StoryWeaver. The essence of the #6FrameStoryChallenge was to tell a good story using just 6 illustrations. The campaign inspired nearly 70 illustrators to donate their time and skills to India’s first open-source story-publishing platform for children.What started out as an experimental campaign soon blossomed into a carnival of art, birthing nearly 500 new illustrations. These wordless narratives cut across language barriers, opening up a world of possibilies, encouraging StoryWeaver’s growing community to dream up multiple stories around these images.The #6FrameStoryChallenge is a powerful reminder of the need for collaboration, to get closer to our mission: “A Book in Every Child’s Hand.”
Haveyou heard of the World Wide Web? No? Never mind.  Now,have you heard of the Internet? Yes? Great!Butwhat IS the Internet? Did you say “I am not quite sure, but I knowit has something to do with computers”? You’re right – it does.But that’s not the whole answer. What’sthe WHOLE answer then? Hmmm. We need an EXPERT to answerthat. And guess what - I know JUST the person! She’s usually to befound near a computer, so let’s go straight to the computer now.
HiNettikutti! Here is a group of kids to meet you! Come on out,come on out, wherever you are! THERE you are! Go on, kids, say hello!And don’t be fooled by her cuteness and her size – she holds aLOT of information in her little head!
SoNettikutti, here’s what everyone wants to know - What IS theInternet?Ooooh.BIG question. Let’s see how I can put it simply. TheInternet (short for ‘INTERconnected NETworks’) is a large, large,LARGE collection of computers from all over the world that areconnected to each other.
Thecomputers could be gigantic computers (the kind research laboratoriesor governments own), desktop computers (the kind you see in banks andcomputer centres), laptops (the kind people sling across theirshoulders and carry with them), cellphones (the kind that ring soloudly and annoyingly in movie halls), and even the little musicplayers with the itty-bitty headphones that seem to grow out ofpeople's ears.
Allthese computers are connected with each other either by real wiresand cables - cables  that run above the ground, underground, evenunder the sea (big computers) - OR by wireless signals (laptops,cellphones, music players). So you see, you don’t have to besitting in one place and have your computer plugged into an electricsocket to be on the Internet – you can even be connected to theworld while you are on the move!
That’sit? We thought the Internet was about talking to friends anddownloading film songs and booking movie tickets and looking forinformation for school projects and finding the telephone number of ahospital!Butthat's not the Internet. All THAT is part of something truly magical,something called… wait for it…. the World Wide Web! This WorldWide Web - let’s call it W3 for short – is a large, large, LARGEcollection of what are called PAGES (there are some 40 BILLION publicpages on the W3 now!).
Apage could contain information in the form of words, numbers,photographs, songs, video clips, and more. This collection of pages(or the W3) ‘sits’ on the Internet, in those millions ofcomputers and cell phones and music players. The Internet is anetwork of networks made up of computers, laptops, tablets and mobilephones. W3 is a collection of connected pages, that is on theInternet.Sothe W3 is NOT the Internet itself, but one PART of it, the coolestpart. If you think of the Internet as a restaurant, then the W3 isthe most popular dish on the menu. And the spoon that helps you diginto this dish and get to your favourite bits of it is called a ‘WebBrowser’.
Oooooh!Now you’ve made us hungry, Nettikutti! But do tell us more aboutwhat makes the W3 so popular. Sure!The W3 is super-exciting because it includes:Email– which allows you to send letters to anyone anywhere in the world– and have them receive it in under a minute! The same letter –if you were sending it to someone in America, say, would have taken15 days to reach him if you had mailed it through a post office. Andit would have cost you a lot of money too. But email is free!
Search –which helps you find useful – and useless! – information on amillion different subjects. You may want to know which states theRiver Ganga flows through, or see what the Statue of Liberty lookslike. You may want to hear the latest film song of your favouriteactor, or watch an episode of a serial that you missed. You may wantto find out the score in the T20 World Cup, or see if there aretickets available on the Mumbai-Pune train tomorrow. If someone whosecomputer is connected to the Internet, somewhere in the world, hasdecided to share this information with the world and put it on theW3, you will be able to find it - instantly! And for free!
ButNettikutti, HOW do you find the page that you want, out of all those billions ofpages? Easy! Each page also has a unique ‘address’ which helpsyour Web Browser find it, just like your home address helps thepostman to find your house. So if you know the page’s address, youcan go to it immediately. What if you don’t know the page’saddress? No problem! You can use a wonderful service called a ‘SearchEngine’, which also sits on the W3, to help you.
Sharing – which helps you share ANYTHING you want – a song you love, yourdog’s picture, a clever way to solve a difficult maths problem,your big idea for keeping our streets free of litter – witheveryone in the world! No single person owns the Internet or the W3,and no government has authority over it*, so you don’t need to askANYONE for permission before you share. Thinkabout how cool that is! Until now, you had books and movies andtelevision and newspapers giving you information, ‘talking’ toyou, but YOU couldn’t talk back to THEM. With the W3, everythinghas changed – you can listen, and YOU CAN HAVE YOUR SAY too. Andyou don’t have to be an important person or a grown-up to do this.THIS is what makes the W3 so fantastic – it is a truly free andopen AND democratic system – it gives EVERYONE who is connected tothe Internet a VOICE.  *Governments do 'control' the internet in their own countries, however. Governments can even 'switch off' the internet, so that their citizens cannot access it, and some have actually done so for short or long periods.
Wow!That’s great, Nettikutti! Now, on a completely different tack –we understand why the first two Ws in W3 stand for World Wide, butwhy is it called a Web? Isn’t it the INTERNET that is actually aweb?Goodquestion! You’re right about the Internet being a web (because ofall those computers being connected to each other), but SO IS THE W3.Let me explain. Remember those billions of pages that the W3 is madeof? THEY are all connected, or ‘hyperlinked’, to each other aswell! That means you can go from one page to another almostendlessly! Do you see now how the W3 is ALSO a web, a HU-MUN-GOUS webof knowledge and information and entertainment for all humankind toenjoy and use?
Wedo, we do! Now we have to have to have to know - who was thesuperbrain who came up with such a wonderful idea? Ithought you’d never ask! For the answer to that question, we haveto go back in time some 20 years, to a nuclear research laboratorycalled CERN in Switzerland. Many scientists there, and across otherlabs in Europe, were working on projects together, but there was noway to share their work with each other quickly and easily. Theywould have to actually travel to each others' labs, or use the postoffice and courier services, to let their teams know how far they hadprogressed.
Oneof the scientists at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee, was getting alittle fed up of this, so he decided to figure out a way to shareinformation better and faster. He came up with a big idea called‘hypertext’ – a way of linking information on computerstogether – to do this.Theidea worked really well for CERN, and everyone was really happy. AndTHEN - Tim Berners-Lee had his SECOND big idea.
He felt his inventionwould benefit other people as well, and that it would be selfish tolimit it to CERN. He talked to the authorities at CERN, and persuadedthem to let him share the idea of hypertext with other scientists allover the world, for free. They agreed! Berners-Lee shared his idea,and urged everyone he shared it with to improve it or add to it asthey wished. The idea of being able to access and share information from anywhere on earth instantly was SO powerful and SO attractive that a LOT of people began to use hypertext.Since anyone could use their own ideas to make it better, people all over the world felt they 'owned' the internet, that it was THEIRS. Which was a wonderful thing.
By 1993, the W3 hadEXPLODED, with millions of people beginning to use it. Today, morethan TWO BILLION people use the W3 in some way – that is almostone-third of all the human beings on the planet!Hmmmm.Life would be very different today if Tim Berners-Lee had decided notto be so generous, right?   Absolutely!So don’t you think we should cheer both him and the W3 with a big Hip,Hip Hurray?Weshould! We should, Nettikutti!Herewe go. To Berners-Lee and the W3 - Hip Hip...... HURRAYYYYYY!

Long, long ago there was a king called Kayanja. He lived in a palace with his queen and their daughter, Princess Apenyo. Princess Apenyo was such a beautiful young woman that every man wanted to marry her. But king Kayanja demanded a very high bride price for the princess.
Near king Kayanja's palace lived a chief called Aludah the Great. He was called "the Great" because everybody in the neighbourhood obeyed him, and he was very violent to anyone who disobeyed him! Chief Aludah's wife had recently died of malaria, and he wanted another wife.
So the fat old chief went to king Kayanja to offer bride wealth for the young princess. While the two men were discussing the price, the maid Kakembo overheard their conversation. Maid Kakembo was very close to princess Apenyo.
Chief Aludah agreed to give half of his wealth to king Kayanja, including a needle, which was also part of the bride price. Preparations were made in secret for the wedding between chief Aludah and princess Apenyo. The king knew that his daughter would not be happy with this decision.
One week before the royal wedding day, maid Kakembo approached Apenyo. "My dear Princess,  your father has organised your wedding with chief Aludah, and it will take place in one week."
Princess Apenyo was shocked and at first didn't know what to do. Then she thought, "I will never marry chief Aludah, that fat old man. Never! I must hurry to Trevor and see what he can do before it's too late." Trevor was princess Apenyo's boyfriend.
That night Apenyo crept out of the palace. If her father discovered where she was going he would be very angry. She ran through the thick, dark forest over rocks and shrubs. When finally she arrived at Trevor's house she was tired and thirsty.
"My love, why have you run all this long distance alone and at such a time of night?" asked Trevor. He fetched water for her and allowed her to rest. Trevor could not settle down while he waited for Apenyo to talk.
"My dear princess, what is the problem?" asked Trevor. Apenyo breathed heavily and said sadly, "My father wants to marry me off to chief Aludah the Great. But I can't marry that horrible man. Trevor, I want to marry you even if you are poor. I am ready to suffer. I love you."
"But princess, I have nothing to pay as your bride price, you know I'm a poor boy," cried Trevor. Apenyo replied, "I know, but it's only you I can get married to." She thought for a while and said, "Let's go to Kategga the boatman and ask him to take us across the river. That way we can escape and my father will never find us."
Back at the palace, king Kayanja had discovered princess Apenyo's disappearance. He ordered his subjects to search for her everywhere. The king's guards, soldiers, and everyone else searched, but they couldn't find the princess. They went back to the king and told him that Apenyo was nowhere to be seen. "Then go back and search again," King Kayanja ordered. He was very annoyed.
As Princess Apenyo and Trevor hurried to the riverbank, dark clouds began gathering in the sky. A heavy storm was coming.
Kategga the boatman was mooring his boat when the young couple approached him. Trevor asked Kategga to row them across the river. Kategga refused to accept, explaining that a heavy storm was fast approaching, and it would be too dangerous.
Trevor insisted and explained to Kategga why they must cross. He then put his hand deep in his pocket and took out a cowrie shell to give to Kategga. When Kategga heard their story and saw the beautiful shell, he felt sorry for them. He agreed to row them across the river in spite of the weather.
When King Kayanja and chief Aludah reached the bank, they saw the three people in the boat. They realised that the young lovers had escaped. Heavy winds rocked the boat and Kategga could no longer control it. King Kayanja shouted, "Apenyo, please come back! I forgive you. I will never punish you or Trevor."
But, it was too late. The boat tipped over and the three people were thrown into the wild water. They all drowned. After that day, everyone in king Kayanja's kingdom could marry anyone they wanted, rich or poor.

Long time ago, there was a man called Kato. He lived in Kabuusu town. He stayed with his dog in a small house.
One day Kato was very sick. He had no one to help him. When he recovered, he decided he would marry a woman who lived nearby.
He invited friends and relatives to attend the marriage ceremony. Kato was very excited because he thought he was getting a helper.
Many things were brought for the bride and her groom. These were baskets of millet, mats, bananas,  groundnuts, and other gifts for the home.
The wedding function ended and all the visitors left for their homes. Kato was ready to start a new life with his wife and the dog.
The next day, Kato served sweet banana to his wife, but she refused to eat.
When Kato went out to hunt, the woman ate all the sweet bananas.
Kato came back from hunting and he was hungry. He asked for sweet bananas. His wife said that the dog had eaten them all!
The following day, Kato went to his farm. When he came home, he found that his wife had eaten all the meat. She did not even share with the dog.
Another day, Kato went to visit his friend and when he came back, the woman had eaten all the groundnuts. The basket was completely empty. Kato was annoyed with his new wife.
Kato thought, "Something is wrong with this woman." He decided to apply magic. He put milk in a magic pot, put the pot under the bed, and went out hunting.
The woman saw the pot, and that it was full of milk. At once, she picked up the pot and put it to her mouth. She drank all the milk while the dog watched her.
Unfortunately, the pot got stuck to her mouth. She tried to remove the pot but all in vain. She shouted, and jumped up and down. But the pot stayed stuck. The dog watched all this.
Then the dog ran off to find Kato. The dog barked and barked, and jumped up and down. Kato realised that something was wrong at home.
They ran home together. Kato was very surprised to find his wife with a pot stuck to her mouth. He looked at her and wondered.
Kato touched his wife's cheek and the pot dropped down at once. The woman was very ashamed. She decided to go back to her parents' home.
A bajaj is a three-wheeled vehicle. It is used in town to move fast from place to place.
In our community, driving is a male-dominated activity.  Females are usually not involved in it.
One day, Abebech asked her parents to give her money to take driving lessons. Her parents said to her, "This work is not good for girls. What would people say?"
However, Abebech said, "I have the ability to do anything other people do." She convinced them.  Her parents permitted her to start taking driving lessons.
Abebech successfully completed the training. Her parents discussed what to do next.
Afterwards they agreed to buy a bajaj for her. So, Abebech started to drive a bajaj on Debre Birhan roads.
One day Abebech had a great idea. She posted at the back of her bajaj a notice with her phone number on it.
The notice read, "I transport for free, pregnant women, mothers who have delivered, and children."Women and mothers whose children got sick all called Abebech.
Abebech earned money by transporting people. She continued to give free service to people who did not have money.

My name is Duma and I am ten years old.I live with my sister Zinhle who is thirteen years old.We live with Mama, Baba, our little brother Wandile, and our dog Bhubesi.
Since this coronavirus came, our lives have changed. It is such a small virus but it can make us very sick. Any person can get very sick from this coronavirus.
I am sad because I cannot play with my friends. Wandile is sad that he cannot hug his friends. Zinhle is also sad that she can't share her lip gloss with her friends.
Mama is a cleaner at the hospital in town. Baba sells fruits and vegetables in town.Every morning they leave for work and Zinhle looks after us.
Our neighbour, Gogo, is very old and has a heart problem. No one is allowed near her these days. The coronavirus is very dangerous for older people.We don't want to make her sick.
After work, Mama goes to check on Gogo and brings her fresh fruits. Mama leaves the fruits at the door because she can't go into the house.
Every morning, Zinhle goes to collect water from the nearby taps. Some people are wearing masks, some are not. Zinhle made a mask using her doek. She washes her hands at home. Mama puts hand sanitizer on our hands.
Every night, Mama reminds us: "Wear a fresh mask every day. Wash your hands with soap for 20 seconds when you arrive anywhere. Cover your mouth and nose if you cough or sneeze.""Yes, Mama!" we say.
1. Wash your hands with water.2. Use soap to wash your hands.3. Wash for 20 seconds or slowly count from 1 to 20.4. Rinse your hands with water.5. Dry your hands with clean towel or tissue.6. Now your hands are clean!
We often gathered at grandmother's house to listen to her stories. We liked to sit around the fire, under the stars on a cow skin. Grandmother began her last story for the night, "Hare and Elephant were neighbours and friends."
Hare liked mushrooms, but he was too lazy to farm. So he stole Elephant's mushrooms. Elephant had planted bananas and pumpkins that year. So there were no mushrooms for Hare.
Hare went without food for many days. Then he decided to steal Elephant's bananas. Elephant noticed that someone was stealing his bananas. He went to Hare and said, "Someone is stealing from me."
Hare asked, "Who is the thief?" Elephant began to sing,  "I will catch the thief! Aaah! I will catch the thief! Ooo!"  Hare felt nervous.
Elephant asked Monkey to watch his farm. But Hare did not steal that day or that night. Nor the next day or night. Monkey became tired of watching.
The following day, Hare went to Elephant's farm to steal again. When Elephant came to check on his crops, Hare hid amongst the pumpkin leaves.
Elephant saw leaves move and began singing, "I've caught the thief! Aah! I've caught the thief! Ooo!" Elephant searched everywhere but did not find the thief.
On another day, Hare was there helping himself to Elephant's crops. Elephant arrived at the farm and Hare jumped inside a huge pumpkin to hide.
Elephant noticed the large pumpkin and said, "Ooo! Here is a big pumpkin. I'll eat that for lunch." And he swallowed the pumpkin whole!
Hare tried to jump out of the pumpkin, but could not. Elephant felt something jumping in his stomach and said, "What kind of pumpkin is this that jumps in my stomach?"
Elephant spat out the pumpkin. Before he could examine it, Hare burst out of the pumpkin and ran away as fast as he could. Elephant never caught the thief.
Grandmother said, "And that is the end of the story." "Thank you grandmother," we sleepily chorused. Then we went to bed thinking about grandmother's stories.
Bahati was the Princess of the land of Sushusa.
For many years, Sushusa didn’t receive a singledrop of rain. Famine struck the land. All sources of water dried out. As a result, peoplehad no food or water. Plants started to die and animals suffered.
Princess Bahati’s father, the King of Sushusa, worked hard with hisadvisors to find a solution.
Princess Bahati liked sitting with her father during these meetings. She listened as advisors made one suggestion after another.
Princess Bahati started to think about a possible solutionas well. She couldn’t stand to see the people, plants, and animals suffer.
She wanted to share her ideas with her father, buthe considered Princess Bahati far too young to be taken seriously in the matters of running a kingdom.
She went to her mother, the Queen. The Queen listenedto her proposal, and promised to help Princess Bahati get a fair hearing from the King.
The Queen pleaded with the King and his advisorsto hear out Princess Bahati.
Finally, the King agreed and granted Princess Bahati thechance to explain her plan. Princess Bahati stood before the royal court and started explaining her idea.
She advised that the people of Sushusa could harvestrain water the next time it rains, by digging a big water reservoir.
They can also direct water from the river into thereservoir. The King and his advisors were impressed.  They accepted her plan, andexecuted it with the citizens of Sushusa.
Princess Bahati led the youth of Sushusu to help execute the plan. Together, theydug a big reservoir.
The next time it rained, all of the rain water wasdirected into the reservoir. The river water was also channeled into it.
Eventually, there was abundant water for people,animals and plants alike. Thanks to Princess Bahati, new life now flourished in the land of Sushusa.

In Miwa Forest, there lived a monkey who was always sad. This was because every time she had a baby, it died.
The pain of losing her babies made Monkey jump up and down. She would jump to one branch, then to another, and cry out, "Kwi! Kwi! Kwi!"
Monkey was sadder when she saw other monkeys with their babies.
The sad monkey sat on a branch. Days passed and she cried more and more.
Then she gave birth again. She decided to take the baby to the path.She wanted people passing by, to see the baby and wish it well.
Monkey put her baby on the path. At that time, a hunter was returning home. He saw the baby monkey lying on the side of the path.
The hunter carried the baby monkey to his house. When the hunter reached home, his three sons wanted to hold the baby monkey.
The boys sang: Throw it up! Throw it down! Throw it to me! Throw it to him! The baby monkey was thrown from one child to the other.
Mother Monkey hid in a tree and watched them. She was afraid that this baby would also die, like the others.
Then the hunter's wife saw her children playing with the little monkey. She said, "Be careful! Bring it here. You will drop it!"
She took the baby monkey in her arms, and blessed it.
The hunter's wife put the baby monkey down. Mother Monkey picked the baby up and disappeared into the forest. Mother Monkey never lost another baby from then on.
Long ago, wild animals lived together.  Raven and Fox were good friends.
There was a famine. The animals had nothing to eat.
Fox and Raven went in search of food.They found some meat. Raven started eating alone.
Fox saw Raven eating meat alone. She grabbed the bird. "Shall I kill you or not?" asked Fox.
"Please, do not kill me! Specially, do not throw me off the cliff," begged Raven.
Fox replied, "I will not throw you off the cliff."
But Fox had decided to throw Raven off the cliff.
Fox threw Raven off the cliff. She stood at the edge of the cliff to check for Raven's body.
Meanwhile, Raven had turned in the air and started flying.
Raven landed in a tree.Fox and Raven saw each other.
"I escaped because I am clever," boasted Raven.
"You escaped because I let you escape," replied Fox.

It is hot sunny Saturday morning on the farm. Maya, Duksie and Doobie are helping Mama K in her vegetable garden. The children work all morning. They dig compost into the soil. They weed and water. Then they harvest what is ripe and ready. Today each of the children will take home freshly picked strawberries, spinach and carrots.
Mama K always gives the children a treat for helping her. Sometimes its cake or chocolate, or she buys longsweets that look like snakes. Sometimes it's apples, pears or oranges. Mama K has only one rule. “Share it fair!” The children know they must share the treats equally, so they all get the same amount.
Today Mama K has baked a round strawberry cake with pink icing and berries from her garden. The childrenwait on the grass for their treat. “Here you go!” smiles Mama K. “But remember the rule. Everyone must get the same. Share it fair! Don't fight!”
Maya has the first turn to share the cake. She uses the knife to trace lines in the icing. The others watch her. She does not cut the cake yet. The others must first agree if her way is fair. “I think I will make two cuts down like this. Now we have three slices, all the same!” Maya shows them.
“No way!” says Duksie, “the one in the middle is much too big!” Doobie also shakes his head. Maya laughs and shrugs and tells Duksie to try.
“Here! Pass me the knife, I'll do it. Easy peasy!” chants Duksie. First she rubs out Maya's pattern in the icing and licks her fingers.
Then she makes one cut across and one down. “Look, I made my three slices!” “That's not fair!” shout Mayaand Doobie together.
“Share it fair! The pieces must be the same size and shape,” adds Doobie. “Why don't you try Doobie, SmartyPants?” smirks Duksie. “I bet you can't do it!”
“I wish the cake was a square or a rectangle, and then it would be easy!” says Doobie thoughtfully. “Or, if there were four of us to share the round cake that would also be easy,” says Maya.
And then! A picture comes into Doobie's head. He sees the sparkling silver badge at the front of his father's big red truck. On Sundays he helps his dad to wash the truck, and to polish the shiny badge. “I've got it! I've got it!I know how to do it,” yells Doobie.
“You are full of surprises, Doobie,” says Duksie sweetly. “How did you work it out?” Maya asks. Doobie smiles to himself. For now it his secret. Later, he will tell his dad.
First he uses a knife to smooth Duksie's lines in the icing. Then he traces three lines on the cake. It looksjust like the badge on his dad's truck, with three equal parts.
Just then Mama K comes out of her house. She is carrying a tray with three glasses of cold strawberry juice. “Look Mama K! Doobie found the way to cut the cake into three equal pieces,” Maya tells her. “Well done Doobie,three equal slices! You shared fairly, I'm proud of you all. Now cut the cake and drink your juice. It's time to go home. I will give you plates to take your pieces of cake.”
Maya cuts along Doobie's lines to make three equal slices. Just for fun, the children stack the slices on top of each other to check that they are the same size. Yes they are!
Doobie's dad arrives to pick up the children, and Doobie runs off to meet him. He can't wait to tell his dad how the badge on the truck helped him to solve a very tricky problem!

The dog ran to Petros. They were happy to be together.
The friends said, "We are sorry. He will be our friend too."

Beyond the green grass field, was a pond. It was no ordinary pond. It was a special pond. How special you ask? It had all types of flowers with all the colours you could ever imagine. The pond had water of purple colour. All the people there used to say, “Whoever touches or drinks the water from that pond, turns into a frog.”
The young ones of the frogs also had unique powers, powers just like the humans who were turned into frogs. But there was one frog who always isolated  herself from other frogs. Her name was Zakia. She isolated herself because of her ability to live on land and in water. She was always bullied by her friends because of that. They thought she was lame and boring.
The pond was always beautiful and amazing. Humans thought that the pond and the organisms in it were a danger to their species. Not only because the water would turn them into frogs, but also because of the powers the frogs had. The humans tried to destroy the pond, but were not successful because the frogs would fight back.
However, there was one thing that was able to destroy the magic of the pond. That was sand from the ocean. If the humans found out about this, the pond and its creatures would be doomed. This is because, if the ocean sand was spread around the pond, the frogs would turn into statues, the flowers would die, and the water in the pond would turn grey.
One morning, Zakia was woken up by the loud sound of her fellow frogs screaming. “What is happening?” Zakia asked herself in a scared voice. She quickly ran outside to see what had happened only to find herself looking at the most horrible thing she could ever imagine, “Oh my goodness! Noooh!” she shouted. She could not believe what she saw. The pond was grey. The frogs had frozen like statues and the flowers were dead.
“This could only mean one thing: the humans have found out how to destroy the pond. And now I am the only frog here,” she told herself while staring at the pond from outside her home. She started to cry. Tears were running down her cheeks like a waterfall. “Why me? Why am I the only one left? Why am I not a statue like others?” she asked herself. The more she asked herself these questions, the angrier she got. She started punching the water thinking how beautiful it used to be.
Then suddenly, the water turned purple again. You can only imagine how happy and shocked Zakia was. “Yes, yes, yes, oh my gosh!” she screamed with joy, while jumping up and down. “How could this happen?” she asked herself, “What have I possibly done to turn the water purple again?”
She touched the flowers near the pond. “I remember how gorgeous the flowers were.” Then suddenly the flowers she was touching came back to life. Zakia was shocked now even more than she was before and she could not move. She figured out that she has the power to fix things and bring them back to their normal state just by touching them and thinking about how they used to be. She was so happy. Then she began to bring all the dead flowers back to life. Then she sat down by the pond and thought, “If I can bring dead flowers back to life, can I bring my fellow frogs back? There is only one way to find out. I should try it.”
She rushed to her mother and stared at her with sadness and tears in her eyes. Then she tried to bring her mother back to life.
She thought, “I remember how my mom used to be, breathing and alive.” Then her mother opened her eyes. “Mother! Mother! Can you hear me?” Zakia asked. “Yes, Zakia, I can hear you,” her mother replied.
Zakia’s mother asked, “What happened?” Zakia told her mother everything that had happened including her newly discovered powers. Then she went on and brought back to life the rest of her fellow frogs.
When Zakia was 15 years old, she was chosen as the leader of her frog community. This was not only because of her powers but also because of her bravery and quick thinking. She carried on leading her community and the pond remains immortal.
Kombe and Juma were poor neighbours. They did everything by themselves.
They wished they had a donkey. He would carry things for them.
Kombe said, “Let us buy a donkey together.” They were happy.
When Kombe's father died, Kombe inherited riches. He forgot Juma.
Kombe wanted donkey meat for his dogs. Juma needed the donkey for work.
The judge said, “Each of you can take half the donkey.”
Kombe killed the donkey. Juma carried things for himself once again.
Kombe wanted to burn his hut and build a new one.
Juma said, “Mine will burn too.” The judge agreed with Kombe.
Juma’s hut burned. The judge said, “Kombe burned only his hut.”
Juma had no donkey, no hut. He slept under the tree.
Juma worked hard. He had a good crop of peas.
Kombe’s boys ate most of the peas from Juma’s land.
The boys said, “Ask our father to pay for your peas.”
Juma said, “I don’t want your money. I want my peas.”
The judge told Juma, “Cut the boys open. Take your peas.”
Juma refused to listen. Kombe cried, “Let the elders decide.”
The elders told Kombe, "You killed the donkey. You burned his hut."
They said to Juma, "Killing Kombe's sons is wrong too."
Kombe gave Juma half of his property. They lived happily.
Era uma vez, um homem rico que tinha dois filhos. O homem rico escreveu em seu testamento que o primeiro filho ficaria com todas as suas vacas. E só um galo deveria ir para o seu segundo filho.
Então, depois que o homem morreu, seu primeiro filho ganhou todas as vacas. E o segundo filho só recebeu um galo.
Depois de um tempo, o filho rico ficou doente. Ele foi ao curandeiro para perguntar o que ele deveria fazer para melhorar. O curandeiro disse, "Você deveria abater um galo de uma cor especial."
O filho rico não sabia onde conseguir um galo de uma cor especial. Então ele lembrou do galo de seu irmão. Ele mandou algumas pessoas ao seu irmão.
O irmão disse a eles, "Tudo que eu tenho é este galo. Mas se ele pode fazer meu irmão melhorar, prefiro perder o galo." Ele generosamente deu o galo.
As pessoas o abateram e deram de comer para o irmão doente. O irmão se recuperou de sua doença.
Depois de um tempo a coisa mais curiosa aconteceu. No corpo do irmão rico começou a crescer penas.
Ele não podia acreditar no que estava vendo.
Ele foi aos anciões. Eles disseram, "Esse é o resultado de ter sido injusto com seu irmão. Você pegou todas as vacas e o galo que seu pai deixou para ele." Os anciões disseram ao irmão, "Para melhorar seu irmão deve perdoá-lo."
Os anciões continuaram, "Vamos pegar esta pulseira como um sinal de perdão e dar a seu irmão. Se ele cuspir nela, você será curado."
Os anciãos levaram a pulseira para o irmão e disseram, "Cuspa nela e perdoe seu irmão." O irmão cuspiu na pulseira.
Como resultado, os anciões decidiram dar metade das vacas do irmão rico para o irmão pobre.
The Izinzawu family was a happy family. The two girls learned cooking and gardening from theirmother. The two boys wentout with their father to hunt.
At dinner time every day, they talked about what they had done that day.
The father usually warned the children not to go deep into the forest. He told the family about a strange creature that lived in theforest. "This creature is like two of us put together!"
One day, the girls were playing at the river. Suddenly, from behind a tree, there was a strange creature! The creature hadtwo eyes, two ears, two arms, and two legs.
Shaking with fear, they ran to tell their brothers about what they had seen. But the boys didn't believe them, "The girls are being silly!" they said.
Eventually, curiosity got the better of the boys. They followed the girls to the river to see this strange creature for themselves.
They searched and searched but all they could see was the tall grass and trees.Suddenly, they heard a noise, and looked up.
Up on a tree swung the strangest creature they had ever seen. It had two arms, two hands, two legs and two feet. Instead of only one each, like them.
The frightened children ran home to call their parents. Soon the whole family was at the river to see this creature.
"Don't hurt me!" the creature said, as it hid behind the tree. Now the family could only see the creature's one foot, one leg, one hand, one arm and one eye.
"I am just like you,"continued the creature. "The only difference is that I was made with two of almost everything."
So this was how the Izinzawu family discovered that it was not a creature to be scared of. It was simply a different form of them.
One day,  Rabbit was walking by the riverside.
Hippo was there too,  going for a stroll and eating some nice green grass.
Hippo didn't see that Rabbit was there and she accidentally stepped on Rabbit's foot. Rabbit started screaming at Hippo,  "You Hippo! Can't you see that you're stepping on my foot?"
Hippo apologised to Rabbit,  "I'm so sorry. I didn't see you. Please forgive me!" But Rabbit wouldn't listen and he shouted at Hippo,  "You did that on purpose! Someday,  you'll see! You're going to pay!"
Rabbit went to find Fire and said,  "Go,  burn Hippo when she comes out of the water to eat grass. She stepped on me!"  Fire answered,  "No problem,  Rabbit,  my friend. I'll do just what you ask."
Later,  Hippo was eating grass far from the river when,  "Whoosh!" Fire burst into flame. The flames began to burn Hippo's hair.
Hippo started to cry and ran for the water. All her hair was burned off by the fire. Hippo kept crying,  "My hair has burned in the fire! My hair is all gone! My beautiful hair!"
Rabbit was happy that Hippo's hair was burned. And to this day,  for fear of fire,  the hippo never goes far from the water.

When Rohan woke up, he began to play with Jimmy, his dog.“There’s something you should do first!” said Riya, his big sister. “BRUSH YOUR TEETH!”WOOF!
“I don’t want to brush my teeth! Jimmy doesn’t brush his teeth!”“Animals take care of their teeth too, but in other ways! We must brush our teeth to keep germs away!”“Germs?”“Germs are very tiny creatures that you cannot see. If you don’t brush properly, they stay in your mouth and hurt you!”“Ouch!”“YES! That’s why we must take good care of our teeth by brushing twice a day - morning and night!”“But brushing is no fun!”“I’ll tell you a secret, Rohan! Psst…”  Rohan smiled.
Mummy called out, “It’s breakfast time!” “There’s something we should do first!” said Riya. “WASH OUR HANDS!”WOOF!
“But Jimmy never washes his hands!”Riya laughed, “He doesn’t use his hands or paws to eat like we do! We must wash our hands with soap to get rid of germs.”“Are germs on our hands too?”“Germs are EVERYWHERE!”WOOF!“Aaaah-chhhooo!” Riya covered her mouth with her hands as she sneezed.“Don't do that! My teacher says that we should sneeze into our sleeve, not our hands!" said Rohan.“Why?”“Because when we sneeze into our hands, germs stick to them. If we don’t wash our hands, we spread germs and make others sick!”
“Here comes Germy!” Riya shouted, chasing Rohan and waving herdirty hands.  “EEEEEEEK!”WOOF!
Later Riya showed Rohan the proper way to wash hands. “Wet your hands and turn off the tap. Then rub in some soap on the palms, the back of the hands and between the fingers. Scrub hands for twenty seconds! Now, it’s time to rinse off and dry!”“But that’s a long time!”“Remember my secret?”Rohan smiled.
When they came back home after playing, Riya nudged Rohan, “There’s something we should do first!”Mummy teased, “Play some more?”“TAKE A BATH!”“Mummy, don’t you know that germs are everywhere? We can’t see them, but they stick to our skin and clothes!”“That’s why we must bathe every day…” “…to get rid of them!”
"Start by getting yourself wet,” said Mummy. “Then apply soap all over!” Riya and Rohan giggled as Mummy’s ticklish fingers soaped them up.“Then it’s time to rinse off!”“And dry with a clean towel!”“SUPERCLEAN!”WOOF! “It’s Jimmy’s turn next!”
“Do you want to listen to a story?” asked Papa.
“There’s something we should do first!” reminded Riya. “Tidy UP!”Rohan yawned. “Do we have to?”“Remember you couldn’t find your ball the other day? Putting things away in the proper place makes it easy to find them later!”“And keeps our house neat!” “You both are so smart!” said Papa proudly. “Bedtime!”“Papa! There’s something we should do first!” said Riya, pulling Rohan along.“Make the germs disappear with our magic secret!”Rohan nodded.
A few minutes later, Mummy and Papa heard a familiar tune. “So that’s your secret!” said Papa. “Humming a song to make brushing fun!”“And while washing our hands too!”“That’s a great idea!” said Mummy.WOOF!Rohan and Riya enjoy taking care of themselves. Do you? They make up a game with the germs and guess who wins?
Germs say, yucky, mucky and dirty is FUN!I say, I brush and wash and I know I have won!Germs say, never bathe, it’s a waste of time!I say, smelling nice with soap is so fine.Naughty germ says don’t pick up your things, The house looks better that way.I say, I tidy up because I like my thingsThat is a good way to end my day!And I feel better in every wayI feel better in every way! I FEEL BETTER IN EVERY WAY!!!!!Now make up your secret song and hum it when you have to do boring things!
In a far away town, there was a smart and expensive shoe shop. This is the town in which I was born.
Many people came to this shoe shop, but few could afford to buy the fancy footwear. One day, a rich man with big feet visited the shop.
He put his money on the shop counter. Then, with his hands in his pockets, he walked up and down looking at the shoes.
As he came closer, I held my breath and froze. He stretched out his hands and grabbed me. He sat down and put me on his feet.
He had huge feet, and the smell nearly suffocated me! I was packed into a box. We drove home, and he put me in a cupboard.
He wore me every day. I made him smart and he walked with confidence. I had a hard life. He was always lazy about washing his feet.
In return, sometimes I pinched him, making him limp. Eventually, I became old and broken, with scars and cracks. He put me outside, next to the rubbish bin.
Someone picked me up for recycling, and took me to a leather workshop. At the workshop I was made into a shiny new wallet! I began a new life.
Sonu wore a blue shirt after his bath. Monu and Rina wore blue socks.
Oh,we are all dressed in the same colour today!Come, let us see some other colours!
Hereare Dadi's red chillies, don't touch them!
Aha,Bholu is cutting purple brinjals.
Rani Didi has sunshineyellowlemons.
Colours are fun to see. Now toeat something colourful too! Yummy! Should we eat a pink chuski?
Or a creamy white kulfi?
We can drink tangy greenjaljeera.
Or we can have sweet browndates?
But Ramu's guavas are thebest.
Green on the outside,pinkinside, with pure white salt and red chilli powder!
I have lost my bat, and I cannot find it.
I looked behind the door. It was not there.
I looked for it on the shelf. I could not find it there.
I looked for it under the bed. Not there either.
I searched inside the box. There was no sign of it.
I searched the attic. It was not there.
I looked here, there and everywhere. I could not find it anywhere.
Oh, you have it!
Three siblings, Udoo, Erdoo and Eryum listened to the music of the rain. They wanted to dance in it. They wanted to touch the rainbow that arrived in the sky. Mother said, "No."They cried, hoping to change her mind. It didn't work. Eryum even tried to sneak out of the house to visit the rainbow.
Mother caught him before he could go. She raised her voice so that Eryum and his sisters would hear too."You could catch a cold," she said. "You don't like pepper soup and you would have to eat some, if you caught a cold," she added with a smile.
Hoping that they would ask for a story, she said, "The rainbow is a magical river with healing powers. But it is so high up in the sky that you can't reach it. If you catch a cold, the rainbow can't help you."The children thought about this.
"Mother, please tell us our rainbow story," said Erdoo. "Yes, please mother, I want to hear it too," Udoo chimed in. "Me three," Eryum begged, lifting up three little fingers."Well, let me see, mmmm," she said playfully. "Okay lovelies, gather round. Mother, the storyteller is here!"
Erdoo ran for the naha, the stirring stick they used as their totem. She handed it over to mother. Eryum got the headgear for mother to wear. It never failed to put her into character. They all sat quietly to listen to the story they had heard many times. Udoo blew the whistle, telling mother to start. Then the story began.
"Once, the rainbow was a magical river. It was hidden inside the green woods of Mbadede. Because it had healing powers, it was guarded.If you were sick, you drank the water. The rainbow was always happy to share. But it didn't like badly behaved people."
"Because of the river's magic, there was ice cream along the banks! Everyone who came to drink the water also enjoyed the ice cream, especially children.The ice cream from the river was red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple and indigo."
"One day, a naughty old woman called Mbom came from the land beyond. On arrival, she met with a guard. He did not know her and he felt a strange feeling. But he did not listen to his feelings.He pointed the way into the woods and told her to respect the river. Mbom agreed and went to the water."
"She took a drink and was healed. Then she looked around to make sure she wasn't being watched.Mbom picked up a stone and threw it in. She watched as it rose, and spread into a ripple. Pleased, she picked up a stick. She threw it in. The same thing happened."
"Mbom jumped right into the water! She hoped to get everlasting life. As soon as she jumped, the river rose up. It shot high into the sky, never to return to Mbadede. But sometimes the rainbow follows after the rain, to feel like a river again.And there my story ends," said mother.
"So my lovelies tell me, why do you love this story so much? asked mother. "You often ask me to tell it." "I love it because it reminds me to pay attention to my feelings," Udoo smiled. "It helps me to remember the colours of the rainbow," added Erdoo.
Eryum tried to push his luck, "I love it because it reminds me of ice cream! Can I have some now, pleeeaaase?""Mmmm. It's cold now, let's eat ice cream tomorrow. Shall we?" mother says. Then she adds, "Next time, I will tell the tale of the end of the rainbow."
Once upon a time, all the animals lived in a land known as Kitasha. The land was beautiful and blessed. It was rich in dense forests and beautiful, tall mountains. Water flowed in the rivers from the mountains down to the valleys throughout the year. Food was plenty. Giraffes had no reason to stretch their necks to search for leaves in high trees. Antelopes too had no difficulty finding sweet and young leaves. But this was years ago. Until recently, Kitasha had been facing many years of drought. There was no rain, the rivers were dry.One day, the Elephant (who was the Chairperson of the Forest) called a meeting. All the animals came to the meeting except the Hare.
The Elephant said, “My fellow country-animals, water scarcity in Kitasha has affected us all. There is no indication that it will go away any time soon. I have called this meeting today to ask each of you to think of a solution.”But none of the animals really cared. They kept up old habits like felling and burning trees, even near the river. Soon the rains stopped. Rivers and lakes began drying out. The drought persisted for a long time. Crops failed in farms. Water scarcity quickly led to food scarcity.The Hyena was the first to contribute ideas on how to end the problem. “I suggest that we dig a big well so that we have enough water.” Almost all animals agreed. They were to start digging early in the morning the following day. The Chairperson asked every animal to keep time.
On the following day, all animals except the Hare carried their working tools to the site. Some had hoes, others spades. The work went well. By evening, water filled up the well. The animals were happy. They sang “Water, water, water!” When the Hare heard them singing, he knew that water was now available. After work, the Chairperson looked around but couldn’t see the Hare. “Did anyone see the Hare?” The Baboon said, “I didn’t see him. I know how stubborn he can be. He doesn't like working alone or with others.” The Wild Dog was the Chief Guard. She decided to prepare a roster for all animals to take turns to guard the well. The Hyena was the first.
Next day, the Hare got up early in the morning. He went to draw water from the well. When he got there he found the Hyena on guard. He pretended that he had not come to fetch water from the well.After exchanging greetings, the Hyena asked him, “Where are you going so early in the morning?” The Hare started telling him stories full of lies. He told him that he was heading for a ceremony.“My friend, there is a huge feast today at Simba’s. He has prepared so much meat. He has invited all of us to attend. The feast will start day. Let’s go before other animals get there.” The Hyena agreed to go with the Hare to Simba’s home. After walking together for a while, the Hare suddenly stopped. The Hyena asked him, “Why have you stopped?” The Hare pretended that he wanted to relieve himself. He asked the Hyena to wait for him.
The Hare quickly ran back to the well, drew some water and dirtied the rest of the water. Eventually, the Hyena got bored of waiting for the Hare. Instead of going back to guard the well, he went straight home.. Next day when the sun was about to go up, the animals went to the well. They were surprised to find it dirty. They did not see the Hyena either. They went to his house and asked him what happened. The Hyena didn’t dare tell them the Hare’s antics. He kept mum. But as they kept asking him, be broke his silence. All the animals got very angry. They planned to search for the Hare and punish him severely. They also punished the Hyena by deciding that from that day onwards, he would only survive on the remains of food.
The next animal to be on guard was the Antelope. She promised that she would be careful and would make sure to catch the Hare. Meanwhile, the Hare found out that the Antelope was guarding the well.He went home and collected a bow and some arrows. He went back to the well, took aim at the Antelope but just missed hurting her. The Antelope got so worried that she ran as fast as her legs could carry her. She went back home leaving the well unguarded. The Hare saw his chance. He drew water, bathed and made sure that he dirtied the rest of the water in the well. When the other animals came to the well, they were surprised. The water was dirty. The Antelope was nowhere to be seen. Again! They summoned the Antelope to explain herself. She was shaking like a leaf. She told them how an arrow had narrowly missed her.
The animals did not give up. They vowed to continue guarding the well until they caught the water thief. It was the Tortoise’s turn to guard the well. The Hare, as usual came very early to the well. He looked this way and that but couldn't see any animal on guard. The Tortoise was hiding in his shell but the Hare didn't notice anything. The Hare called out, “Hi, my friend. I have good news for you!” He was hoping whoever was on guard would reveal themselves. But no one came out. The Hare began to draw the water from the well. He took a bath. Just as he was about to dirty the rest of the water in the well, the Tortoise jumped up and caught him. He shouted excitedly, “I've caught the water thief! I've caught him!”
All the animals rushed to the well. Meanwhile, the Hare and the Tortoise were a sight to see. They held each other tightly. The Hare wanted to free himself but the Tortoise tightened his grip. The other animals were happy that at last they had caught the thief. The Elephant suggested that the Hare should be slaughtered and that the soup from his meat should be served to the Lion who was sick. The Hare cried for forgiveness. But no one was ready to forgive him. The Rhinoceros brought a sharp knife. The Wild Dog began sharpening the knife. The Hare knew that his time was up. He tried to free himself from the grip of the Tortoise and managed to jump out.The Wild Don quickly threw the knife at the Hare. The knife cut the Hare’s tail just it jumped behind a bush. This is why to this day, the Hare has a short tail and does not seem to trust anyone.

One day, the hyena's son died.
A donkey heard the news. He ran to his relatives and said, "The hyena's son is dead." All the other donkeys said, "The hyena's son? That's good news. All the hyenas are our enemies."
One old donkey said, "Brothers, we must go to the hyena's funeral and show respect.""What? Go to the hyena's funeral?" The other donkeys said. "We don't want to go. We're frightened. The hyenas will eat us."
"Listen," said the old donkey. "If we don't go, the hyenas will be angry with us. They will have a reason to eat us.""You are right," said all the other donkeys. "We must go to the hyena's funeral. If we go, the hyenas will be happy with us. Perhaps they will become our friends."
The hyenas saw the donkeys outside their house."Why are the donkeys here? Have they come to laugh at us?" The hyenas wondered.The donkeys heard the hyenas. They were frightened and they began to sing.
This was the donkeys' song:Great hyenas, you hunt all night.  And we hear you sing in the cold moonlight.Your teeth are long. Your eyes are bright. Though your food is black, your dung is white.But now your son lies on his bed. And he is dead! Our lord is dead!
The dead hyena's uncle answered them with another song: Your song is good. Your words are sweet. Come in, dear donkeys. Take a seat!But what did you bring for us to eat? Hyenas are hungry. Hyenas want meat!
The donkeys were very frightened now."Let's run away," said one. "We can't. The hyenas will chase us," said another.
The oldest donkey said, "My lords, we came to show respect to you. We are sorry that your son is dead. We will pray to God to comfort you. Now we must go back to our home."
The donkeys began to go."Wait!" the hyenas said. "You cannot leave. You must give us something to eat. Cut off your lips and give them to us."
The donkeys looked at each other."If we give them our lips, perhaps they will let us go," they thought.
The hyenas cut off the donkeys' lips, and ate them.
Again, the donkeys tried to go.
"Stop!" Cried the dead hyena's uncle. "My brothers, will you let these donkeys go? Look at them! We can see their teeth! They are laughing at us!""They are laughing! They are laughing!" said all the hyenas.
They jumped on the donkeys. They killed them, and began to eat them.
Before the oldest donkey died, he looked at the hyenas and said, "Wicked hyenas, we came with our song to comfort you but we were wrong! Next time you are hungry, don't pretend that you need a reason to eat your friend!"
I like my teacher very much.
She is beautiful. She is a good teacher. She is kind and patient.
She braided her hair pretty nice.
She placed colorful beads in her hair.
The beads are green, white, red, and yellow.
Mom, could you please braid my hair just like my teacher's?
When I grow older, I will also place colorful beads on my hair.
I will grow up to be just like my teacher!
Once upon a time, there was a king. He used to have three wives, they lived in a village called Nuru.
One day, the king called his wives and said, "My beloved wives, today I would like to have a delicious meal. The ones who is going to cook more delicious food than others, will win a great prize."
One of his wives went to the market and bought some beef and spices. When she came back home she began to cook what she thought to be delicious.
Another wife went to a different market. And bought the meat of wild animal with so many spices. This one also returned home to cook.
The last wife woke up and went to pay a visit to the king's mother. She was told to prepare tradition dish without putting oil,or any modern spice.
The third wife went in the garden to look for different stuff in order to prepare traditional food.
The king together with his friends, reached to his wives who cooked meat. However, the king was not happy with what was prepared. Then they decided to go to the one who prepared traditional food.
The king was tremendously happy with that food, because he loved it. Finally he appointed her_ the third wife, to be the queen of his kingdom. From then, that woman became respectful in the entire neighborhood. It's because she knew the ways of pleasing THE KING.
Mama K has been harvesting cabbages all week. Doobie,  Maya and Duksie help Mama K in her vegetable garden on Saturday mornings. Today the children are going to help with counting and packing the cabbages. Then Baba K will take boxes of cabbages to sell at the market.
The taxi drops off the children at the garden gate. They can see the huge heap of cabbages piled up near Baba K's old truck. "Yo! What a lot of cabbages!" says Maya pointing. "There must be a thousand cabbages there!" laughs Duksie. "No way! Two hundred at the most!" disagrees Doobie.
Mama K is waiting at the gate. "Hello everyone,  I'm happy to see you!" she greets the children. "Now let's get to work. You'll need to count the cabbages and put them into boxes,  12 cabbages in each box. I have 20 boxes. Two of you can each pack 7 boxes and one of you can pack 6 boxes."
The children stand around the pile of cabbages. They talk about different ways to count the cabbages. "I think I will count mine in 2s," Maya says. "I like counting in 4s," says Duksie,  "it's quicker."  "I'm going to count in 3s,  just to be different!" pipes up Doobie.
Soon the children have filled 20 boxes. "Good work!" exclaims Mama K. "Look,  there are some cabbages left over. My pigs love cabbages so let's share these with them," she suggests. "How many cabbages did you pack into boxes? How many cabbages were left over?" she asks the children.
The next job is to write the price on each box and then help Baba K load the boxes on his truck. They must put half the boxes on one side of the truck and half on the other side,  to balance the load.
"We're almost done!" says Baba K. "Let's see,  how many more boxes we must still put on each side to balance the load?"
Soon all 20 boxes are loaded onto the truck. Baba K warms up the engine and drives off to market. "If I can sell all the boxes," he thinks to himself,  "I'll have enough money to fix the pig pen and get a surprise for the children!"
Back at the farm,  Mama K and the children water plants and rake leaves. By twelve o'clock they are all tired. Mama K tells them,  "It's time for your treat. Can you guess what it I have for you today?"
She goes inside to fetch their surprise. The children wait patiently for her to return while they guess what she might bring them. When she comes down the path her apron pockets are bulging!
"Let's see if you guessed right! What's in store for you today?" Mama K tips out her apron pockets and a pile of yellow apples falls onto the table. "See,  I was right!" Duksie squeals. Mama K tells the children,  "Now remember the rule. Share fair! No one to get more or less than the other!"
First the children count the apples in 2s. The count: 2,  4,  6,  8,  10,  12,  14,  16,  and 1 apple left over, Altogether there are 17 apples.
Next,  they share out the apples equally. There are 2 apples left over. The children then put their apples in their bags to take home. How many does each child get?
"Let's cut the 2 apples to share between us," suggests Duksie. "How many parts of the apple will we each get?" asks Maya. "I know the answer!" smiles Doobie.
Just then Baba K arrives home from market. The truck is empty and Baba K is smiling. "I sold all the cabbages. Now I can fix the pig pen and buy you that soccer ball you wanted.  "Yay!" shout the children."
There was a time when all the animals lived together as friends. One day, they decided to have a meeting to elect a king.
Rooster wanted to be king. So he lied to the other animals. He told them, "The red comb on my head is fire! Don't touch the comb on my head!"
The other animals believed Rooster. They decided to elect Rooster as their king. The animals hoped that Rooster's fire would help them in cold weather.
Then came a day when it rained. And rained. And rained. It was cold. Everything was wet and cold.
"Where can we get fire to warm our bodies?" Rabbit asked the other animals.
"We can get fire from the comb on Rooster's head. Rooster is our king because he has fire on his head," said Monkey.
The animals agreed with Monkey. They sent Fox to collect fire from king Rooster.
Fox found Rooster in a deep sleep. So he decided to take fire without asking Rooster.
Fox collected some dry grass. He put the grass next to the comb on Rooster's head. Nothing happened. The grass did not catch fire.
"Wake up king Rooster!" yelled Fox. "We need fire now."
But Rooster could not give fire to Fox.Fox was angry.
Fox went back to the other animals. He told them the truth about the comb on Rooster's head. From that day, no one was afraid of Rooster.  And foxes eat roosters and their families.
Khayanga lived with her parents happily until they died when she was ten years old.
Khayanga was taken in by Rosa,  a distant relative. Rosa was kind to Khayanga, but she was old,  frail and poor.
Khayanga often visited her parents' graves to tell them of her misery.
One day when she visited, she received a gift. It was a very special Gourd which appeared from her parents' graves.
The Gourd sang a beautiful and soothing song. Khayanga recognised the voice as that of her late mother. It went like this.
Khayanga carried her special Gourd everywhere. With her Gourd, Khayanga felt her parents' presence and protection.
One day,  something bad happened to her special Gourd. It broke when she was fetching water in the river. Khayanga's heart broke as well.
Khayanga held the pieces of the broken Gourd in her small hands and sang:
Khayanga heard her mother's voice saying to her: "Our child,  pick up the pieces that are left. Fetch water with them and wash your feet. When you finish washing, close your eyes." Khayanga obeyed and suddenly, the broken Gourd became whole once again.
Khayanga continued to carry her Gourd everywhere she went. Wherever she passed, people whispered to each other, "What type of gourd is this?" With her special Gourd, Khayanga received everything she needed.
With the special Gourd, Khayanga knew that her parents were watching over her. Nothing bad could happen to her.
In my village, lives Mister Kio. Mister Kio has a cat called Safi.
When Mister Kio goes to work, he leaves the door open.
Safi sits in the doorway to watch over the house.
When the neighbour's dog comes close, Safi scares him away.
The dog runs away.
When a neighbour knocks at the door, Safi is ready to scratch.
The neighbour turns and runs away.
When Safi is hungry, she closes the door.
Safi eats her food.
Afterwards, Safi jumps onto the sofa and sleeps, "Purr! Purr! Purr!"
When Mister Kio returns, Safi stretches happily and welcomes him home.
Mister Kio and Safi sit down, and each of them reads the newspaper.
The Izinzawu family was a happy family. The two girls learned cooking and gardening from their mother. The two boys went out with their father to hunt.
At dinner time every day,  they talked about what they had done that day.
The father usually warned the children not to go deep into the forest. He told the family about a strange creature that lived in the forest. "This creature is like two of us put together!"
One day,  the girls were playing at the river. Suddenly,  from behind a tree, there was a strange creature! The creature had two eyes,  two ears, two arms, and two legs.
Shaking with fear,  they ran to tell their brothers about what they had seen. But the boys didn't believe them,  "The girls are being silly!" they said.
Eventually,  curiosity got the better of the boys. They followed the girls to the river to see this strange creature for themselves.
They searched and searched but all they could see was the tall grass and trees. Suddenly,  they heard a noise,  and looked up.
Up on a tree swung the strangest creature they had ever seen. It had two arms, two hands, two legs and two feet. Instead of only one each,  like them.
The frightened children ran home to call their parents. Soon the whole family was at the river to see this creature.
"Don't hurt me!" the creature said,  as it hid behind the tree. Now the family could only see the creature's one foot,  one leg,  one hand,  one arm and one eye.
"I am just like you," continued the creature. "The only difference is that I was made with two of almost everything."
So this was how the Izinzawu family discovered that it was not a creature to be scared of. It was simply a different form of them.
In a tiny village of  Lumela, lives a little boy called Chipego.  Chipego lives with his father, mother and his  little sister Mutinta.  There is one more special member of the family, Pendo the cow. Chipego helps his father to look after Pendo in exchange for pocket money that he uses to buy books. Meet Chipego. He is 10 years old and in Grade 5 at the village school. Chipego always comes top of his class. "What's his secret?" his schoolmates ask themselves."He's excellent in reading and writing. How does he do it?" they wonder. Chipego tells them it is because he reads lots of books. While they waste their time doing nothing, he spends all his free time reading.
Chipego sometimes earns K80.00 a week in pocket money. He spends most of the pocket money on books at the second-hand book shop in his village.So how does Chipego earn enough pocket money for these books? Read on to find out.
Meet Pendo, the family's milking cow. She produces over 20 litres of milk per day. Chipego's father sells the milk.A cow needs food and water, and time to graze in the field. So each day after school, Chipego helps with this work. Chipego's father gives him pocket money for the work he does. And it is this money that Chipego saves to buy books each week.
First, Chipego gives Pendo a bunch of carrots. He gives her exactly eight carrots a day. Each day he picks the carrots from his father's vegetable garden, enough for a day at a time.You can work it out. You will find that Pendo eats nearly 60 carrots a week. Can you tell exactly how many?
After that, Chipego takes Pendo to graze in the fields. His father warned him to watch the time and give Pendo not  more than three quarters of an hour to graze.Pendo usually starts grazing at about14:15 hrs, so that Chipego can take her back to the milking shed at 15 hours. In winter when it gets dark earlier, Chipego may start grazing earlier, around 13:30 hrs.
Next Chipego gives Pendo water. Without water Pendo won't produce milk, no matter how much Chipego feeds her. Chipego fetches buckets of water from the village pump because there isn't one nearby.Pendo's trough holds about 30 litres of water. Chipego's bucket only holds 5 litres. So to fill the trough Chipego has to make many trips. Can you work out how many trips he has to make?
Then, Chipego takes Pendo to his father to get her daily 12 kg bag of grain. Chipego calculates that's almost 90 kg a week.Each bag costs K39.00. Chipego works out the cost of grain for each week. First he works out the cost of 7 bags at K40.00, which makes K280.00 Then he subtracts K7.00 to get K273.00 "That's over K1 000 a month!" Chipego estimates. Is he correct?
Chipego's father milks Pendo twice a day. She produces about 24 litres of milk a day, so about 12 litres for each milking.Sometimes Chipego helps with the milking but it is not as easy as it looks. "One day," he thinks to himself, "I will have my own cows and I will have to do all the milking myself."
His father pours the milk from the big bucket into smaller two litre cans or one litre bottles. He then sells the milk for K8.00 a litre.Once a week Chipego's father donates 25 litres of milk to Bulela School feeding scheme. Each child gets a quarter litre of this milk. That means that 100 children get milk on this day.
For each litre of milk sold, his father gives Chipego 50 ngwee. That doesn't sound like a lot, but if his father sells 24 litres a day, it adds up to quite a bit. Can you tell how much?Chipego saves his money until Saturday when he makes a trip to the book shop. Each book costs less than k10.00, so in a good week, he can buy quite a few.
Chipego also loves to drink Pendo's milk. His father says that milk helps to build strong bones and teeth and makes a person fit and healthy.So by drinking milk and eating lots of vegetables from his father's garden, Chipego is strong and healthy. He seldom gets sick and never goes hungry. His mother loves making mabisi using Pendo's milk too. His young sister enjoys adding the milk to her chibwantu! Hmmm! Yummy!
Chipego never forgets to thank Pendo at the end of each day. He rewards her with extra carrots or spinach leaves that he finds lying around the garden."Thank you Pendo, you are my best friend! It is thanks to you that I am strong, healthy and clever. If not for you I would never be able to buy all the books that help me be top of my class." One day I will be a veterinary  doctor because of you!Pendo is very lucky because Mutinta, Chipego's mother and Father also rewards her! What an amazing cow!

Many years ago, Sun and Water were great friends. Both lived on earth together.
Sun used to visit Water very often, but Water never went to visit Sun.
At last Sun asked Water why he never came to visit. Water replied that Sun's house was too small. “If I come with my family we will drive you out,” he said.
Then Water said, “If you wish me to visit you, build a very large compound. My people are very many, and take up a lot of room.” Sun promised to build a very big compound.
Sun returned home to his wife, Moon, who greeted him with a broad smile. Sun told Moon what he had promised Water.
The next day he started building a huge compound in which to entertain his friend.
As soon as the compound was completed, he asked Water to come and visit them.
When Water arrived, he asked Sun whether it would be safe for him to enter. “Yes, come in, my friend,” Sun answered.
Water began to flow in. He was accompanied by crocodiles, fish, frogs, snakes, snails, flukes, turtles, and all the water animals.
Very soon Water was knee-deep. He asked Sun if it was still safe.“Yes,” Sun again answered. So more of water's people came in.
Water reached the level of the top of a person's head. He asked Sun, “Can more of my people come in?” Sun and Moon both answered, “Yes.” Water flowed on, until Sun and Moon had to perch themselves on the top of the roof.
Water's people continued to rush in. Very soon they reached the top of the roof. Sun and Moon were forced to go up into the sky. They have remained in the sky ever since.
Three siblings, Udoo, Erdoo and Eryum listened to the music of the rain. They wanted to dance in it. They wanted to touch the rainbow that arrived in the sky. Mother said, "No." They cried, hoping to change her mind. It didn't work. Eryum even tried to sneak out of the house to visit the rainbow.
Mother caught him before he could go. She raised her voice so that Eryum and his sisters would hear too. "You could catch a cold," she said. "You don't like pepper soup and you would have to eat some, if you caught a cold," she added with a smile.
Hoping that they would ask for a story, she said, "The rainbow is a magical river with healing powers. But it is so high up in the sky that you can't reach it. If you catch a cold, the rainbow can't help you." The children thought about this.
"Mother, please tell us our rainbow story," said Erdoo. "Yes, please mother, I want to hear it too," Udoo chimed in. "Me three," Eryum begged, lifting up three little fingers. "Well, let me see, mmmm," she said playfully. "Okay lovelies, gather round. Mother, the storyteller is here!"
Erdoo ran for the naha, the stirring stick they used as their totem. She handed it over to mother. Eryum got the headgear for mother to wear. It never failed to put her into character. They all sat quietly to listen to the story they had heard many times. Udoo blew the whistle, telling mother to start. Then the story began.
"Once, the rainbow was a magical river. It was hidden inside the green woods of Mbadede. Because it had healing powers, it was guarded. If you were sick, you drank the water. The rainbow was always happy to share. But it didn't like badly behaved people."
"Because of the river's magic, there was ice cream along the banks! Everyone who came to drink the water also enjoyed the ice cream, especially children. The ice cream from the river was red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple and indigo."
"One day, a naughty old woman called Mbom came from the land beyond. On arrival, she met with a guard. He did not know her and he felt a strange feeling. But he did not listen to his feelings. He pointed the way into the woods and told her to respect the river. Mbom agreed and went to the water."
"She took a drink and was healed. Then she looked around to make sure she wasn't being watched. Mbom picked up a stone and threw it in. She watched as it rose, and spread into a ripple. Pleased, she picked up a stick. She threw it in. The same thing happened."
"Mbom jumped right into the water! She hoped to get everlasting life. As soon as she jumped, the river rose up.  It shot high into the sky, never to return to Mbadede. But sometimes the rainbow follows after the rain, to feel like a river again. And there my story ends," said mother.
"So my lovelies tell me, why do you love this story so much? asked mother. "You often ask me to tell it.""I love it because it reminds me to pay attention to my feelings," Udoo smiled. "It helps me to remember the colours of the rainbow," added Erdoo.
Eryum tried to push his luck, "I love it because it reminds me of ice cream! Can I have some now, pleeeaaase?" "Mmmm. It's cold now, let's eat ice cream tomorrow. Shall we?" mother says. Then she adds, "Next time, I will tell the tale of the end of the rainbow."
Long ago,  there was no night in Opio's village. People slept when they were tired and worked when they were awake.
One day Opio went out hunting with his dogs. After a short time,  his dogs started to chase an antelope. Opio followed them. He ran for many hours. Every time he became tired,  he rested. Then he would run again. But he could not find his dogs.
After many days,  he came to a village. He went to one of the houses and said to the owner,  "I have chased an antelope for a long time and I am very tired. I want to rest." The man said,  "Sit down and rest. Would you like some beer?" Opio was very thirsty so he drank some. Then he went to sleep.
When he woke up,  he couldn't see. He opened and closed his eyes many times. "You have given me something very bad to drink," he said to the man. "I can't see properly anymore!" "There is nothing wrong with you," the man replied. "It's night now. Haven't you ever seen night? When the day leaves,  the night comes."
Opio asked many questions about the night. He began to like it very much. He and his new friend talked until morning. He stayed for another day so that he could see the night come again.
The next morning he asked his friend,  "How can I take the night to my own village? I want my people to see the night." The man explained,  "When it starts to get dark this evening,  walk to your village. If you look straight in front,  the night will follow you. If you look back,  the night will go away."
Opio did as he was told. That evening,  he began to walk towards his village. He felt the dark night behind him as he walked. He was tempted to look back,  but he did not.
When he came to his village,  the villagers were afraid. They asked Opio,  "What disease have you brought to us? What is this dark thing following you?" Opio said,  "My friends,  this dark thing is called night. You are afraid and I was afraid,  too."
Opio continued to explain,  "You will learn to like the night. When the light comes we can work and when night comes,  we can rest."
And that is how night came to Opio's village.

Long time ago, Cassava and Palm lived in a village called Koowa. They were very good friends. They visited each other every day. They were farmers. They worked very hard on their farms.
In a certain year, there was no rain. The crops did not grow well. All the plants dried up. People did not have any food to eat. Cassava and Palm decided to travel to another village to look for work.
On their way, they met a woman. "Good afternoon," they greeted her. She responded and asked, "Where are you going?" "We are going to the next village to look for work," said Palm.
"What work can you do?" the woman asked. The friends responded, "We can provide food for your family and animals." The woman asked, "What do you need to provide the food?" "Give us land, water and good care," they replied.
The woman took them home with her.
One afternoon, Palm tree and Cassava had an argument. Cassava said he was more important than Palm. Palm said he was more important than Cassava.
The woman heard them from her room. She came out and asked "Why are you fighting?"
Cassava spoke first. "I am more important than Palm tree. I provide tubers for your fufu, gari, boiled cassava and cassava dough."
"My stems are used for planting. My leaves and peels feed your animals. What does Palm tree do?" asked Cassava.
Palm tree laughed, shook his head and said, "Woman, do you remember the palm soup you enjoy so much? I provide it."
"I provide the palm oil for preparing kpokpoi and the palm kernel oil for frying fish and meat. How would you prepare stews and gravies without oil?"
"In addition, my fronds provide shade for your huts. You cool your heart with my sweet, rich, foamy palm wine after your hard day's work."
"Above all, the brooms that are used to sweep the rooms and compounds come from me," concluded Palm.
"Hmmm!" sighed the woman. "Alright friends, I have heard you. I will settle this problem."
"Both of you are very important to me. The two of you together make a delicious meal, fufu and palm-nut soup!" said the woman.
The woman prepared palm nut soup with fufu from cassavas. She invited her friends to eat with her. They enjoyed the meal very much. Since then, Cassava and Palm tree have remained good friends.
Once upon a time, there was a female giant. One day, she was walking near the lake.She met three little girls and asked them, "Who among you is loved by both parents?"
One of the girls said, "My mother loves me most." Another said, "My father loves me most." But the third one said, "I am loved by both parents."
The giant asked the girl loved by both parents to help her carry firewood. So the girl followed the giant.
They walked for some distance. The girl asked the giant, "Where is your firewood?" The giant replied, "It is near those trees over there!"
When they reached the trees, the girl asked again, "Where is your firewood?" The giant answered, "Not far now!"
They met a man along the way. He asked the giant, "What is the name of your child?" The giant replied, "She is called the talking bag."
The girl burst out and sang: I am not called the talking bag. My name is Kaamungei! Oh! My mother, whom I love. Oh! My father, whom I love. Oh! My calabash, which I use to drink milk!
When the man heard what the girl sang, he rescued her and took her back to her parents.The story ends there!
It is dry.
The sun is hot.
It is windy.
It is cloudy.
It is cold.
It is raining.
There is thunder.
I see a rainbow.

Lynne, Oupa Karel and Anton were getting things ready for Lynne's birthday party.
Anton and Lynne are going to bake a cake. Oupa Karel reads the recipe.
"Let's mix these ingredients in the big bowl," said Lynne.
Anton stirred the ingredients and made a big mess.
"The cake feels heavy now," said Oupa Karel.
"Your friends have arrived," said Oupa Karel.
Anton thought the first present would be heavy because it was big.
It was a pillow and it weighed very little.
Anton thought the next present would be light because it was small.
It was a painted rock and it weighed a lot.
The children said that 1 kilogram of rocks weighs the same as 1 kilogram of feathers.
Lynne's cake was burnt.
Lynne was very sad.
Auntie Mavis asked Anton to guess how much her present weighed.
"It weighs the same as the cake that burned," said Anton.
Everyone said, "happy birthday, Lynne."

It was really sad.No one would stay with us.
But it is not so bad, because my mother is still here with me.
In a small garden in the city, there was a big tree. Many small animals lived together on the big tree. There also lived a family of squirrels. Vikki was one little squirrel among them who liked to talk big. His cousin, Kato from Far Forest had come to visit him.
One evening, all the animals who lived in the little garden were just going to sleep.They heard loud sounds from the park, next to the little garden.
Kato and the other squirrels saw big yellow machines. They also saw men in hard yellow hats, pointing to the little garden and other houses on the street. They were going to pull them all down and build a parking lot.
The people who lived there would move to other houses. No one gave a thought to the animals, birds and insects who lived in the little garden.
The machines were first spotted by the mole family. To be more exact, by Mister Popples, the eldest who told Master Mopples, who in turn told the youngest,  Little Popples.
When they were young they were called Pop, Mop and Pip.
Mister Popples told the squirrels, the squirrels told the birds, caterpillars, butterflies, tiny spiders and all those who lived in the little garden. There was total panic, a lot of running, flying, scurrying and hopping, with no one knowing what to do? Where to go?
The caterpillars said, "Let us look for leaves." The butterflies said, "We want flowers." The mice wanted holes. The squirrels, birds and insects wanted trees,  bushes and grass.All the animals wanted the soft earth, not cement or concrete. "Where will we find all this?" they cried. "We will surely die," they said and wept.
Kato's uncle and aunt were very quiet and all the little squirrels crept close to their mom. Kato cleared his throat and spoke shyly, "I live in the Far Forest, may be we can all go there?"
There was a buzz of excitement and someone said, "How?" Kato scratched his head and thought hard, "Well, the Squirrel Express can take the squirrels and the butterflies, spiders caterpillars and all the insects." He added, "The birds can either fly or come with us. The moles, mice and the grass snake family can go by the underground Mole Express."
Everyone thought it was a splendid idea. Mister Popples rushed to ask Mister Grumbles, the driver of the underground express train if he could take them all to the Far Forest. Mister Grumbles fumbled, stumbled, bumbled before he finally mumbled, "Alright." Now it was Mister Popples' turn to be grand. "Friends, you need not worry, my grandfather's grandson's. Third nephew's second niece's family live in the Far Forest."
So, in the early hours of the morning, the Squirrel Express and the Mole underground train with all its passengers were ready. They chugged their way to the Far Forest with its trees, flowers, ponds and soft earth.
Hare owned a donkey and a small red basin.
When Hare needed a big basin, he borrowed Hyena's blue basin.
Hyena wanted to wash his clothes in his basin.
"Your basin had a baby," said Hare. Hyena took both basins.
Another day,  Hare borrowed Hyena's basin again.
When Hyena went to get his basin, Hare had bad news.
Hyena called the big animals to decide the truth.
"Things that live and give birth, also die," explained Hare.
A long time ago,  the king of the bush was Mr Lion.
He sent his animals to stop the noise coming from a small lake in the bush. But they did not succeed!
An elephant volunteered to stop it. The elephant was sent out as a guard.
At midnight the noise began and the elephant started killing the frogs. He did the same thing the next day.
After a couple of weeks,  King Lion was happy because the elephant had stopped the noise.
But about a month later,  they saw a lot of insects on their farm.
King Lion asked the elephant to call the frogs to come and eat the insects.
The elephant was very nervous because he had killed all of them. He said,  "Sorry,  sorry,  I k- k- k- killed them!"
Then King Lion said: Elephant,  I asked you to stop the noise,  not to kill the frogs. And the elephant was put in prison for many years!
And the king told all the animals to always do exactly what he said.
Anansi and Rabbit were friends. Anansi was jealous of Rabbit's wealth.
Anansi took over Rabbit’s farm. He chased away Rabbit.
Anansi sold all the crops. He got a lot of money.
Anansi went home carrying his basket on his head.
Anansi put the basket down.He went to shelter from the rain.
The rain caused flooding, so Anansi hid in a hole.
Vulture saw the basket and covered it with his wings.
“This basket is mine,” said Vulture. “It is mine!” shouted Anansi.
Vulture said, “I found money and maize unprotected.”
The chief and his elders took time to decide who was right.
Finally, they said, “Vulture is right. The basket is his.”
Rabbit returned to his farm. Anansi had no money, or friends.
My village has goats. It is far from big cities.
Mother said, "Zainab, we have a present for your sixth birthday."
Mother, aunt and I waited for the bus.
I sat on mother’s lap. I slept the whole way.
We reached the market. I saw a beautiful blue helicopter.
One stall had fruits. I asked mother, “Which ones are these?”
Mother said, “These are apples.” I begged, “Please, buy me one.”
I forgot my mother’s hand. I thought only of my apple.
When I finished eating, I was alone. I started to cry.
A woman took me where there were other children.
I thought children were sold at the market. I cried more.
A man asked, "Where is Zainab?"I hid away from him.
My mother's familiar voice called, "Zainab!" I was very happy.
My aunt pulled out a beautiful helicopter. "It's yours!" she said.
A poor farmer had an old ox that didn't like to work. The ox didn't want to plough the farmer's field. He wanted to stay at home and eat grass, drink water and rest.
The farmer had a donkey, too. The donkey and the ox were friends. At the end of the day, the ox and the donkey talked to each other. "I'm so tired," the ox said. "I worked hard all day. The plough is big and heavy. The farmer never lets me rest."
The donkey thought, "The ox is lazy. He doesn't like to work." He cried, "Do you think your plough is heavy? Believe me, my friend, it is light! I carried a sack of grain on my back today. It was heavier than your plough, I am sure."
The next day, the two animals met again. "I had a bad day today," the ox said. "My master's field is far away, and it was full of stones. I worked hard all day. I didn't have any rest."
"You worked hard?" asked the donkey. "Today I travelled many kilometres to the market in the town. I'm sure I worked harder than you."
The next day, the ox came home late again. "Oh, my friend," he said to the donkey. "Today was a very bad day for me."But the donkey didn't want to listen to the ox any more.
He said, "You're always tired. When the farmer comes, lie down and say, 'Moo! Moo!' He will think that you are ill. He will let you rest."The ox liked the donkey's idea. "Thank you, dear donkey, that's a very good idea," he said.
The next morning, the ox lay down and closed his eyes. "Moo! Moo!" he said.The farmer looked at him. "My poor old ox is sick," he said. "But I must plough my field. Who will help me? Perhaps the donkey! He can pull the plough today."
The farmer tied the plough to the donkey, and began to hit him with his whip. "Go on! Faster! Pull!" he called out to the donkey.The donkey worked hard all day, and in the evening he was very tired.
The donkey slowly walked home. The ox said, "Dear donkey, I had a lovely day today. I ate some grass, drank some water and I rested. I want to rest again tomorrow. Give me another idea."
The donkey thought, "His work is much worse than mine. I don't want to do it again tomorrow." The donkey said, "Be careful. The farmer said 'My ox is always tired and now he is sick. If he is not better tomorrow, I will kill him, and we can eat the meat.'"
The ox was very frightened. He cried, "Really? Did he say that? Then I will work tomorrow. I feel quite better now. I'm not tired at all!"

Every day when eight-year-old Sisanda gets home from school,  she changes out of her uniform,  eats her lunch and plays a game of umlabalaba with her grandfather. They have so much fun flying their "cows" around the board that she doesn't want to stop. But then he reminds her that she wants to become a bank manager one day when she grows up.
For her last birthday,  Sisanda had a special treat – her parents got permission for her to have a party at the game reserve. The giraffes at the reserve were curious about this group of people. They stretched out their long necks for the best view of the party and they even seemed to want some of the birthday cake! Sisanda loved the giraffes. All animals were special to her,  but it was the quiet and gentle giraffes that stole her heart. She could spend all day watching them.
"Oh no!" said Sisanda starting to cry. "I wish there was something I could do. The baby giraffe must be crying just like me." Sisanda cried and cried. Her mother tried to comfort her. She even read Sisanda an extra story at bedtime to help her forget how sorry she felt for that baby giraffe. Eventually,  Sisanda drifted off to sleep to the sound of her mama's voice.
They found the baby giraffe standing alone. His willowy neck drooped and his big brown eyes looked dull. Sisanda stood as close to him as she could. She opened her small bag and took out a book. Then,  to her parents' surprise,  she began to read to the baby giraffe. He turned his head towards her voice and listened as if he could understand every word. At first,  Sisanda's parents thought reading to a giraffe was a strange thing to do,  but they changed their minds when they saw how peaceful he looked − his gentle eyes looking at Sisanda.
On the day of the outing,  forty Grade 3 children waited eagerly for the reserve gates to open. Then Sisanda proudly led everyone to Thokozani. Some of the children looked at the tall giraffe in amazement. Others giggled nervously. Their teacher,  Miss Khanyile,  just smiled.

Fana and her family live in Debre Birhan, a busy town in Ethiopia. Fana is a Grade 3 student. She is good-hearted and wise.
Fana loves animals. She has a cat, two hens, a goat and a dove. She spends time with these animals, feeding them, and playing with them.
One day, Fana was playing in the school yard with her friends when she saw children throwing stones at doves. “Why are they hurting the doves?” She asked herself.
She stopped playing and ran towards the children throwing stones. At first her friends didn't understand what was happening, then theyfollowed her. “Stop throwing stones,” shouted Fana.
The other children ran away. Fana caught the two injured doves. She saw wounds on their wings. She decided to take the two doves home to look after them.
She fed the doves. In the evening she told her family what she saw and did during the day, and how she saved the doves.
In the morning Fana and her parents went to the clinic and got medicine for the doves. After a few days, the doves' wounds healed. Fana felt very happy.
Fana always tells her friends, “I love animals. Animals are useful to us and they are our friends. We must protect and preserve them.”
There lived an old man called Hagos. He lived with his three sons. Hagos wanted his sons to have wealth after his death. He prepared three boxes for them.
Hagos went to his neighbour Haile and said, “I want my sons to have wealth. I have prepared three boxes. I want you to give them the boxes after I die.”
After Hagos died, Haile called the sons together. He told them, “Your father gave me these boxes before he died. You will each find your name on one of them. Take yours please.”
The sons took the boxes and opened them. The first box had gold in it. The second box had soil. The third box had animal dung in it.
The one who found gold was very happy. The other two were not happy. They started quarrelling with him.
“You are brothers, you should not quarrel. Let me take you to a wise old man to advise you,” said Haile to the three brothers.
Haile took the brothers to the wise old man. “Good morning, we have come to ask advice about inheritance,” said Haile to the old man.
Haile told the wise old man about the three boxes that Hagos had left for his sons. “Now they are quarrelling because only one received gold,” explained Haile.
The wise old man asserted, “Your father had a reason for giving each of you a particular box.”
He continued, “The one who received gold, your father wants you to be a merchant. The one who received soil, your father wants you to be a farmer.”
“The one who received animal dung, your father wants you to be a cowboy. Your father wanted you each to have his own profession,” the old man concluded.
After they listened to the old man's advice the three brothers agreed. They worked in their professions and lived happily.
One day there was a great famine in the land. No one had anything to eat except the crows. Each morning they flew a long distance to where there was a tree with ripe figs in the middle of a wide river. Then they flew back with the figs for themselves and their relatives. The sight of so many figs made Anansi's mouth water. How could he get them for himself?
He thought of a plan. He carefully covered his bottom with sticky beeswax. Then he took a piece of clay pot and went to see the crows. “Please could you help me?” he asked. “I need a live coal to get my fire going again.” As they were getting the coal from the fire, Anansi carefully sat firmly on one of the largest figs, so that it would stick to his bottom. He thanked the crows, and hurried home to enjoy the fig.
But one fig wasn't enough for him. He went back a second time, and did the same. When he went back a third time, the crows began to get suspicious. “Why do you keep coming back to us to get a coal?” they said. Anansi answered, “Every time when I get home, the coal has burnt out.” “You're lying!” said the crows. “You just want our food!” “That's not true,” said Anansi. And he started crying.
The crows felt sorry for him. The next morning at first light, each crow gave him a feather. He flew with them to the fig tree in the middle of the wide river. When he saw the luscious figs, Anansi wanted them all for himself. Each time a crow tried to pick a fig, he shouted out, “That one is mine! I saw it first!” And then he took the fig and put it into his bag. Eventually he had all the figs and the crows had none.
He was left all alone as the darkness began to fall. “If I don't want to stay in this tree for the rest of my life,” he said to himself, “I'll just have to jump into the air like the crows.” So he took a deep breath, jumped, and PLOP! He fell into the river right among the crocodiles.
“What do we have here?” said a gruff crocodile voice. “A tasty morsel to eat, nyum”. “Oh please don't” said Anansi. And he began to cry. “I'm one of you, don't you know? I got lost in the days of your grandfathers and no one was able to find me. You're the first of my relatives I've ever met!” He cried so much that the crocodiles felt sorry for him.
The oldest crocodile said, “We'll know you're one of us if you can eat and enjoy mud soup just like we do.” They gave him a pot of dirty brown water. “Just like my grandmother used to make it!” Anansi said. But he made a hole in the ground with his back foot, and a hole in the pot with his front foot. As he pretended to drink the soup, it oozed down through the pot into the hole beneath his feet.
“Delicious!” he exclaimed, giving back the empty pot. "Now we know you are definitely one of us," the crocodiles said. So they allowed Anansi to sleep in their hole with them for the night. "Tomorrow morning I'll tell you the story of my life," said Anansi as they fell asleep.
Early the next morning, before first light, Anansi woke up one of the crocodiles. "I want to go and fetch my wife and children from across the river, so that they can help me tell my story. Will you help me before the others wake up?" he asked the crocodile.
The crocodile was grumpy at being woken up so early. “Please help me! You swim much faster than I do,” Anansi said. The crocodile agreed, and Anansi rode on his back to the bank of the river. He climbed off quickly. “I'll be back soon! Don't go away!” Anansi said, as he disappeared through the grass.
As far as we know, the crocodile is waiting for him still, with just his long snout and his beady eyes above the surface of the river.
Emeka lived in a fine house in Ebiba town. His parents were rich.  Emeka had a dog called Chita. He looked after Chita very well.
Every day, Emeka's father took him to school in his car. He also brought Emeka home after school.One afternoon on their way home, Emeka's father stopped to buy something at a big shop.
From the car, Emeka looked across the road and saw an old man. He was carrying a big load on his head. He was tired and walked slowly. Emeka kept looking at him.
The old man sat under the shade of a tree on the walkway and opened his bag. He had two flat plastic water bottles, which he was making into shoes.
Emeka thought about that old man for a long time. He felt sad. When he got home, he could not eat. He thought about what he could do.
He got up and took some money from his money bag. He called Chita and jumped on his bicycle. Emeka rode to the shop where his father had shopped.
The boy ran into the shop and came out with a bag. He went to where the old man was resting against a tree.Emeka called out, "Good afternoon, sir." The man answered, "Peace to you, my child."
Emeka asked, "Sir, where do you come from? The old man replied, "My child, hunger has chased me from my village. I am here to earn money."
Emeka gave his shopping bag to the old man. Tears filled the man's eyes as he took the sandals from the bag. He thanked Emeka from his heart.
"I must go now before mother starts looking for me," said EmekaThe old man waved to the boy and his dog as they went. "Bless you, my child," he said with a smile.
"Where were you?" mother asked Emeka as soon as he got home. She was worried.Emeka told her everything. She felt touched by his story.
Later, Emeka's father told him, "We are proud of what you did. But you must always tell us before you leave the house." Then he added, "Now, here is the money that you spent!"
Long ago, there was a man who had a very serious wound on his leg. He could not stand or walk. This man lived in a village with his wife and their children.
The couple had three sons and one daughter. The daughter's name was Nangila. Her duty was to take care of her father. The sons worked on the land and grazed animals.
Nangila was a beautiful girl. All the villagers liked and respected her. Her parents wanted a good husband for Nangila. They set a difficult task in order to find the right man.
Anyone who wanted to marry Nangila would have to get a herb from a lake near the village. This herb would heal her father's wound. But the lake was filled with dangerous spirits.
Some men tried to get the herb but returned without it. Some men did not return from the lake at all.
Nangila felt worried. Not even her brothers would go to the lake. One day, she decided to fetch the herb herself. Her mother said, "My daughter, if strong men have failed, how will you succeed?" But Nangila had made up her mind.
On the way to the lake, Nangila met an old woman carrying wood. She helped the woman to carry her firewood. The old woman was grateful. She said to Nangila, "I will tell you how to reach the spirit lake and what to do when you get there."
When she reached the shore of the lake, Nangila saw the spirit family drinking and dancing. She waited and watched. One by one, the spirits fell asleep.
Once the spirits were all sleeping, Nangila dived into the lake. She found the herb and put it in her bag. As she swam back to land, the waves were rising.
When Nangila reached the shore the spirits were awake. She was afraid, but she sang the song the old woman taught her: I, daughter of Wekesa, am from the lake. I came because men are too scared to come. My father needs this herb to heal his wound. That is why I am here, in the land where many are scared to reach, for you are the rulers.
Nangila's voice was so sweet that the spirits asked her to sing for them again and again. Her singing sent the spirits back to sleep. Then Nangila ran very fast until she got to her village.
Everyone was waiting for Nangila to return. After treating his wound with the herb her father was able to stand again. The entire village danced and praised Nangila.
Long long ago people didn't know anything. They didn't know how to plant crops, or how to weave cloth,  or how to make iron tools. The god Nyame up in the sky had all the wisdom of the world. He kept it safe in a clay pot.
One day, Nyame decided that he would give the pot of wisdom to Anansi. Every time Anansi looked in the clay pot, he learned something new. It was so exciting!
Greedy Anansi thought, "I'll keep the pot safe at the top of a tall tree. Then I can have it all to myself!" He spun a long thread, wound it round the clay pot, and tied it to his stomach. He began to climb the tree. But it was hard climbing the tree with the pot bumping him in the knees all the time.
All the time Anansi's young son had been standing at the bottom of the tree watching. He said, "Wouldn't it be easier to climb if you tied the pot to your back instead?" Anansi tried tying the clay pot full of wisdom to his back, and it really was a lot easier.
In no time he reached the top of the tree. But then he stopped and thought, "I'm supposed to be the one with all the wisdom, and here my son was cleverer than me!" Anansi was so angry about this that he threw the clay pot down out of the tree.
It smashed into pieces on the ground. The wisdom was free for everyone to share. And that is how people learned to farm, to weave cloth, to make iron tools, and all the other things that people know how to do.
I had never worn shoes before. When I saw children wearing nice shoes, I would look at them with longing.
My mother would say, "You will have many pairs in the future, just wait!" Sometimes I did not believe her. "When is the future?" I asked her one day.
Time passed and it was nearly Christmas. Everybody was busy going to the market and coming back with bags of new things. "Mother, are we going to the market?" I asked her.
The day before Christmas, my mother woke me up earlier than usual. She asked me to fetch the big shopping basket she always carried to the market.
At the open-air market there were many parents with their children. They were buying new clothes and stocking up on food.
We went straight to where there were many different types of shoes. My eyes were wide with amazement. I gaped at row after row of neatly arranged shoes.
After trying on many pairs, I settled for black lace-up shoes. At home that night, I couldn't sleep. I was so excited thinking of how I would wear my new shoes and show off to every child in the village.
After a while, I got out of bed and put on the shoes. I walked slowly around the room and then put the shoes back into the box. I lay down again, but I couldn't sleep.
I got up and tried on the shoes a second time. I strutted around the room for a while and then put them back.
I lay down once more and tried to sleep. But I got up a third time. I put on the shoes and jumped around the room. Then I felt tired. I decided to get back into bed.
The following morning, I was woken by my mother. "What is this I see?" she asked.
I was wearing my new shoes in bed!
An apple fell from a tree under which Rabbit was sleeping.
Rabbit heard a voice say, “Run Rabbit run!”
Rabbit told Chicken, “Something fell and I heard, ‘Run Rabbit run!'”
Chicken started running when she heard what Rabbit said.
They told Dog, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Dog started running with Rabbit and Chicken.
Dog told Horse, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Horse started to run with the others.
Donkey asked, “Why are you running?” Horse replied, “I don’t know.”
Donkey started running with them.
Donkey told Cow, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Cow was worried and started to run as well.
Cow told Cat, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Cat started running with the other animals.
They met a boy. “Don’t you know what happened?” he asked.
“It was me who said, ‘Run Rabbit run!’” laughed the boy.
For many months, the skies were dry. Lomongin, the famous rain-maker, talked to his gods. People gathered outside his home, anxiously waiting for a message of hope.
When he came out, he assured people that the creator was going to give them rain soon. They would be able to plant their crops.
Children played outside as we waited for the rains. Later that day, we saw big white clouds in the far east. I knew they were rain clouds.
People were still thinking about what the rain-maker said. Mother shouted loudly, “There! The clouds are now dark. Come inside.”
The rain poured down.
We had waited for the rains! At first we rejoiced. But the rains did not stop.
There was water everywhere. The bridge linking our village to the mainland was washed away.
Houses were washed away by floods. What was a blessing, was now a disaster for us.
Everybody had prepared for planting. But now they could not plant. People of my village had longed for rain but now they did not want it anymore. We had no bridge to cross on. Many had no homes.
And, we had another problem! We saw crocodiles swimming everywhere. This had never happened before. We were confused.
We could not go shopping because all the shops were across the river. Children couldn't go to school because schools were across the river.
What should have been a blessing, became a curse to us. Lomongin, the rainmaker, was disappointed as well. The only one who was happy, was Kapuus with his eight cats!
There was once a girl called Chikondi who lived with her parents near the village of Chionda. One day Chikondi's mother sent her to fetch water at the well.
On the way,  she met her friends. They were going to the forest to get firewood. Chikondi wanted to go with them. "Please wait for me under this  masuku tree!" she said,  "I have to fetch water for my mother." But her friends didn't want to wait.
"All right,  I'll catch up with you in the forest!" said Chikondi She ran off to fetch water and take it to her mother. Then she went to the forest to look for her friends.
She followed a path that led to a stream. On the other side of the stream were many tiny paths each one,  leading in a different direction. "Which path had her friends taken?" she wondered.
She chose the biggest path,  and walked and walked,  but she could not find her friends. She was so tired that when she sat under a tree to rest,  she fell fast asleep.
When Chikondi woke up,  it was dark. In the darkness,  yellow eyes were gleaming. She was surrounded by hyenas! She was too terrified even to cry out. She tried running,  but the hyenas circled her hungrily.
"Don't move," said the gruff voice of the biggest hyena. "If you run,  we'll eat you!" "Please let me go home!" Chikonde pleaded.
But instead the hyenas took Chikondi to their house in the forest. It was a dirty hut full of bones and buzzing flies. She lay down and pretended to go to sleep.
In the darkness,  she heard the hyenas talking to each other. "How is the fire doing?" one hyena asked. "Is the water boiling?" "Everything is ready," was the reply. "Should I bring her?" "Yes,  yes!" growled the other hyenas. "We're hungry!" They were ready to drag Chikondi out of the hut.
But the big hyena spoke,  "Hyenas,  wait. Remember the rule of the village. No hyena may eat alone. We have to invite the whole family to share a meal." "I'll go and call the in-laws," said his wife. "I'll go and fetch my cousins," said the small hyena. "I'll fetch our brothers and sisters," said another. "And I will remain here with our food," said the big hyena.
The big hyena sat in the doorway of the hut and the others went off in different directions. They took a long time,  and the big hyena began to doze in front of the warm fire. Soon he was snoring. This was Chikondi's chance! But how was she going to get past the hyena? He was so big he filled the whole doorway.
There was only one way. She took a flying leap right over the hyena's back,  and ran as fast as her legs could carry her.
Just then the other hyenas returned,  and saw what had happened. They ran after her,  howling with anger and disappointment. But it was too late.
As she came to her village,  one of the villagers recognised her and shouted,  "Chikondi,  "Chikondi is coming,  "Chikondi is coming." Her father and mother ran out to meet her. They hugged her,  while thanking God for saving their child,  ""Chikondi,  "Chikondi  we thought you had died!"
From that day,  "Chikondi and the other children never again went back to the forest alone.
Once there was a family who had a tree with such sweet fruit that everyone visited their compound to taste the fruit. The family also had a very beautiful daughter. Many people admired her dazzling beauty, white eyes and above all, her great personality.
When she grew up into a young woman, young and old men flocked to her home seeking her hand in marriage. Her parents decided that the man who could sit in the compound the whole day without eating any fruit would be given her hand in marriage.
The news spread all over the village. The first man to come was the head of all farmers in the village. He was handsome, rich and young. He was welcomed and served the fruit. He sat for a few minutes, but before long, he ate the fruit and was sent away.
The leader of animal keepers was next. He was handsome, young and rich. The girl admired him. But when he was served with the fruit, he immediately ate it, and was sent away.
The next man to come had many pieces of land. He was arrogant and ugly. The girl prayed that he would eat and go away. When served, he refused to eat. The time passed, and the girl started begging him to eat. By around four o'clock, he was overcome with hunger, and he ate. He, too, was sent away.
Next, the chief came around. He was arrogant, old,  and ugly. No one liked him in the village. The girl wished that he would eat and go away. When he was served with the fruit, he refused to eat. He stayed the whole day. At about six o'clock, he asked if he could use the toilet.
A few days later, a young, handsome, rich prince arrived. The girl looked at him in admiration. She took him aside, and begged him not to eat the fruit. She served him much less fruit than the other suitors. But by midday the prince had already eaten and was sent away. The girl burst into tears of anger and disappointment.
The next day, a farmer came around. He was poor and lazy, but he was young and popular among many people for being a great talker. He came determined to win. The girl served him many fruits and asked him to eat and go away.
Her parents had to hand over their daughter to the "lazy one." The girl begged to be saved from her fate, but her parents could do nothing. As the farmer took her home, he sang such a beautiful song while clapping his hands. Many people flocked to the road to see the couple.
Among the people were servants of the rich prince. They called the farmer aside, and offered him money and cattle if he would leave the girl. Without a moment's hesitation, he took the money and the cattle, and walked off.
The servants dressed the girl in fine clothes and took her to the palace, straight to the prince. Before long, her parents were called and a ceremony was organised to join the two in marriage.
A long time ago,  there lived a man called Mulongo and his wife Nambuya. They had two children,  Mukhwana and Namono. There was a famine in the land where they lived. All the villagers,  including Mulongo and his family,  would leave their homes early to look for food in the forest.
One day,  Mulongo,  his wife and children decided to go deep in the forest in search of something to eat. From morning to evening they looked for food but they found nothing. Nambuya urged her husband to go further into the forest. Mulongo led the way as Nambuya and the two children followed.
Suddenly Mulongo saw a beautiful banana plantation. He called his wife and said,  "Is that not a banana plantation? I can see bananas and other food crops. I wonder whose it is." They moved on and soon saw a house in the middle of the plantation. They stopped,  looked in all directions,  but there was no one around. Because they were hungry and it was nearly night time,  they decided to sit and wait for the owner.
Suddenly they heard heavy breathing close to the house. They were frightened to see a huge ogre arrive. "Who are you and what do you want?" asked the ogre in a fearful voice. Mulongo in a trembling voice said,  "We came looking for food because there is famine in our place." The ogre gave them food.
For several days the ogre allowed Mulongo and his family to eat his crops without asking for anything in return. One morning,  however,  the ogre said to Nambuya,  "I want you to cook your son for me to eat when I come back this evening." When the ogre had gone Mulongo went into the bush and killed some small animals,  which he asked his wife to cook for the ogre. Meanwhile he asked Mukhwana to climb up a leafy mango tree and hide.
In the evening the ogre returned and asked,  "Have you cooked Mukhwana for me?" Mulongo's wife answered,  "Yes." She gave the ogre the meat and he greedily ate everything. Then he said,  "Tomorrow you cook your daughter."
The following morning Mulongo and his wife did as they had done on the first day. Namono was hidden up the mango tree. When the ogre returned he said,  "Did you cook Namono?" Again,  Nambuya told the ogre that she had done so.
After eating,  the ogre instructed Nambuya to cook her husband Mulongo,  the next day. Nambuya was perturbed but Mulongo said he would go out again and catch some animals to cook. He did that and after giving the meat to his wife,  he also climbed up the mango tree to hide.
At dusk the ogre came back. Nambuya gave the meat to the ogre who enjoyed it very much. He told Nambuya,  "Tomorrow cook yourself." When the ogre had left Nambuya called her husband to advise her. Mulongo said,  "Go and look for some small animals and cook them for the ogre. When everything is ready,  come up the tree where we are."
The ogre came back in the afternoon and started eating his tasty evening meal of sweet meat. He felt sleepy,  went to lie under the mango tree and began snoring. But not so long after,  the ogre woke up because he heard noises above him. The ogre looked up to the tree and saw Mulongo and his wife and children.
The ogre was very angry. "So you deceived me? Let me come and get you," he shouted. As the ogre was struggling to climb up the tree,  Mulongo quickly thought of a trick and said,  "It will be easier for you to reach us if you tie a rope around your neck and we help to pull you up."
The ogre ran into the house,  brought a strong rope and after tying it around his neck he threw the other end of the rope to Mulongo. Mulongo and his wife and children started pulling the ogre up as they twisted the rope. The rope soon tightened around the ogre's neck until he could not breathe and died. Mulongo and his family came down the tree and took over the ogre's house and property.
Grandma's garden was wonderful. It was full of sorghum, millet, and cassava. But best of all were the bananas. Although Grandma had many grandchildren, I secretly knew that I was her favourite. She invited me often to her house. She also told me little secrets. But there was one secret she did not share with me. Where she ripened bananas.
One day I saw a big straw basket placed in the sun outside Grandma's house. When I asked what it was for, the only answer I got was, "It's my magic basket." Next to the basket, there were several banana leaves that Grandma turned from time to time. I was curious. "What are the leaves for, Grandma?" I asked. The only answer I got was, "They are my magic leaves."
It was so interesting watching Grandma, the bananas, the banana leaves and the big straw basket. But Grandma sent me off to my mother on an errand. "Grandma, please, let me watch as you prepare." "Don't be stubborn, child, do as you are told," she insisted. I took off running.
When I returned, Grandma was sitting outside but with neither the basket nor the bananas. "Grandma,  where is the basket, where are all the bananas, and where..." But the only answer I got was, "They are in my magic place." It was so disappointing!
Two days later, Grandma sent me to fetch her walking stick from her bedroom. As soon as I opened the door, I was welcomed by the strong smell of ripening bananas. In the inner room was grandma's big magic straw basket. It was well hidden by an old blanket. I lifted it and sniffed that glorious smell.
Grandma's voice startled me when she called, "What are you doing? Hurry up and bring me the stick." I hurried out with her walking stick. "What are you smiling about?" Grandma asked. Her question made me realise that I was still smiling at the discovery of her magic place.
The following day when Grandma came to visit my mother, I rushed to her house to check the bananas once more. There was a bunch of very ripe ones. I picked one and hid it in my dress. After covering the basket again, I went behind the house and quickly ate the banana. It was the sweetest banana I had ever tasted.
The following day, when Grandma was in the garden picking vegetables, I sneaked in and peered at the bananas. Nearly all were ripe. I couldn't help taking a bunch of four. As I tiptoed towards the door, I heard Grandma coughing outside. I just managed to hide the bananas under my dress and walked past her.
The following day was market day. Grandma woke up early. She always took ripe bananas and cassava to sell at the market. I did not hurry to visit her that day. But I could not avoid her for long.
Later that evening I was called by my mother and father, and Grandma. I knew why. That night as I lay down to sleep, I knew I could never steal again. Not from grandma, not from my parents, and certainly not from anyone else.

Ajao, a bat, lay in his house very ill. There was no one to attend to him.
Then, Ajao died.
The neighbours said, "Ajao is dead. We must call his relations to come and bury him."
The neighbours went and called the birds saying, "A relative of yours is dead."
The birds came and saw that it was Ajao. They said, "This animal is not part of our family."
"All our family have feathers but Ajao has none. So, he is not one of us." The birds went away.
The neighbours reasoned together. They agreed, "The birds are right. Ajao has no feathers. So, he is not their relative."
One of them said, "He must be part of the family of rats. He looks like them."
The neighbours went and called the rats saying, "One of your family is dead."
The rats came and saw that it was Ajao. They said, "This animal is not part of our family."
"Everyone in our family has a tail. Ajao has no tail." The rats went away.
No relations were found for Ajao and he remained unburied.
Neema thought a lot about her birthday. She asked her friends, “Is your birth date the same as mine? My mother told me I was born on February 29th.” None of her friends shared her birth date.
Neema asked her mother, “Ma! Last year we didn't celebrate my birthday. How is it that my friend Anna celebrates her birthday every year?”
Her mother said, “Be patient, Neema. Your birthday will come and when it does, we’ll throw a big party for you. We’ll invite all your friends.”
Neema said, “But Ma, I waited for it last year. The year ended without my birthday ever arriving.”
“For Anna’s birthday, we gave her so many presents and congratulated her. We ate and sang beautiful songs. We were all so happy. I also want to invite all my friends so that we can eat, play together and sing.”
“Don’t worry, Neema,” said her mother. "Your birthday is next week, isn't it? We’ll throw a big birthday party.” But Neema didn't believe her. What if her birthday never came, like last year?
The next week, it was 29th February! Neema was thrilled. Her birthday had come after all! “It’s my birthday!” she shouted.
Neema’s friends had come. They had all brought her presents. Her parents also gave her a present: a colourful birthday hat. She looked lovely!Neema looked at the presents. There were so many! Her mother told her, “Neema, your birthday is celebrated on a leap year, which happens only once in four years.”
“Thank you, Papa. Thank you, Ma. Goodbye, 29th February. We’ll meet again after four years!”

My name is Sesi. I am six years old. I am a new student at Manyinga Primary School.
My first day at school was exciting. I got up early in the morning. My father took me to school. On the way there were many other students.Some were with their parents.
I heard the bell ringing, “Gong! Gong! Gong!” Other students started running.
Each student took his or her place in a line. I ran and joined the others.When I looked at the other students, I felt very small. They seemed much older than me.
An older girl took me by the hand to where students of my age were gathered. I was with the wrong class!
As I stood in line with the students my age, I heard someone yell, “Madam, this boy has wet his shorts!” We all turned back. I saw a little boy holding his shorts, looking sad.
Both his legs were wet. His eyes were wet with tears. An older boy came and took him by the hand to get help.
Then a teacher showed us our classroom. It was large and clean.
One student came in late. He was holding his shoes.The teacher asked why. He said that his mother had taught him to always take off his shoes before stepping into a room. We all laughed.
The bell rang again, “Gong! Gong! Gong!” We rushed outside and stood in lines. A teacher came to us and told us that it was break time. There was no need to stand in lines. It was time to play!
After a short while, the bell rang again. All other students were rushing into their classrooms. I was confused, I did not know where to go. I had forgotten my classroom!
I saw a classroom in front of me and stepped inside. Two other students followed me. None of us knew where to go.
One of the students who was with me started crying. An older girl asked him what was wrong. He replied that he wanted to see his mother. Some of the other students laughed, but some wanted to help.
One of the older girls took us to our classroom. Our teacher told us that soon it would be time to go home, and we should wait for our parents to pick us up from the classroom.
The bell rang again, “Gong! Gong! Gong!” We were happy to see our parents waiting for us outside.
After dinner, my father and mother asked me what my day at school had been like. I told them about how we lost our classroom. They laughed and said I should listen carefully to the teachers.
That night, I couldn't sleep. The night was long and I was eager to start my second day of school.
Fati was a little girl who ran like the wind.She loved to laugh, and always tried hard to do as she was told.
One day, Fati went with her mother and father to look for firewood.
Fati liked to help her mother and father, but there was so much to do and so much to see.There were birds, monkeys, and the sky!
Mother said, "Fati, please listen! You can look for firewood here and you can look for firewood there."
"But Fati, please watch where you go and be very careful." She replied, "Yes, mother."
Soon Fati's mother and father were very busy.
They found big pieces of firewood. They found small pieces of firewood.
Fati was also very busy. She found small pieces of firewood. She found very small pieces of firewood.
Then Fati looked up. She saw a red bird in the tall grass.
Next, Fati looked down. She saw a brown ant on the dusty path.
Fati saw a beautiful leaf. The leaf was shiny and green. She put one finger on the beautiful leaf.
Fati said, "This does not feel like a leaf." Suddenly, the beautiful leaf moved! Fati said, "This is not a beautiful leaf. This is a green snake!"
Fati screamed, "Eii!" She ran very fast to look for her mother and father.
Fati saw her father and shouted, "A snake! A snake!" Father said, "Where? Where?" Fati said, "There! There!"
Then her father chased the green snake with a stick. The green snake slithered away.
Father said, "Fati, you are safe. Let's go to mother and tell her about the green snake."
Mother said, "Fati, I am happy the green snake did not bite you."
"But next time, please, look where you go, and be more careful." And that was the end of that.

One day after a heavy rain, Iman looked across the sky and saw colours in it for the first time.
How beautiful, she thought. Someone must have worked very hard, painting the sky with a brush like Daddy paints houses.
She ran to her sister and said, “Zarah look! Someone has painted the sky for us and made it beautiful.”
But Zarah said, “No, silly. That is a rainbow. You are little and I am big. I know why it is in the sky. Let me show you.”
Zarah took Iman to the zoo. She said, “Rainbows do not appear because lion cubs roar for the first time or because elephants are born.”
She took Iman to a field of flowers and said, “They do not appear because butterflies lose their colours in the clouds.”
She showed Iman a book. She said, “They do not even appear because rhinos run across the ground andscare colours up into the sky.”
“I know why rainbows really appear. Mummy told me and now I'll tell you.” Zarah took Iman's hand and led her to a playground.
“Rainbows appear in the sky because of children like you and me. One day, colours looked down from above and liked what they could see.”
“They saw children with light skin, dark skin and everything in between. They thought, 'How wonderful it must be to be as beautiful as these.'”
“They came together in the sky and spoke about what they could do. They decided, 'If we are to be beautifulwe must do it as a group.'”
“Now they join together and shine as brightly as they can. Hoping to be as beautiful as the children they see,just like you and me.”

Long ago, there was a man who had a very serious wound on his leg. He could not stand or walk. This man lived in a village with his wife and their children.
The couple had three sons and one daughter. The daughter's name was Nangila. Her duty was to take care of her father. The sons worked on the land and grazed animals.
Nangila was a beautiful girl. All the villagers liked and respected her. Her parents wanted a good husband for Nangila. They set a difficult task in order to find theright man.
Anyone who wanted to marry Nangila would have to get a herb from a lake near the village. This herb would healher father's wound. Butthe lake was filled with dangerous spirits.
Some men tried to get the herb but returned without it. Some men did not return from the lake at all.
Nangila felt worried. Not even her brothers would go to the lake. One day, she decided to fetch the herb herself. Her mother said, "My daughter, if strong men have failed, how will you succeed?" But Nangila had made up her mind.
On the way to the lake, Nangila met an old woman carrying wood. She helped the woman to carry her firewood. The old woman was grateful. She said to Nangila, "I will tell you how to reach the spirit lake and what to do when you get there."
When she reached the shore of the lake, Nangila saw the spirit family drinking and dancing. She waited and watched. One by one, the spirits fell asleep.
Once the spirits were all sleeping, Nangila dived intothe lake. She found the herb and put it in her bag. As she swam back to land, the waves were rising.
When Nangila reached the shore the spirits were awake. She was afraid, but she sang the song the old woman taught her, "I, daughter of Wekesa, am from the lake. I came because men are too scared to come. My father needs this herb to heal his wound. That is why I am here, in the land where many are scared to reach, for you are the rulers."
Nangila's voice was so sweet that the spirits asked her to sing for them again and again. Her singing sent the spirits back to sleep. Then Nangila ran very fast until she got to her village.
Everyone was waiting for Nangila to return. After treating his wound with the herb her father was able to stand again. The entire village danced and praised Nangila.
One time, there was a great famine in the land. No one had anything to eat except the crows. Each morning they flew a long distance to where there was a tree with ripe figs in the middle of a wide river. They always flew back with the figs for themselves and their relatives. The sight of so many figs made Anansi's mouth water. How could he get them for himself?
He thought of a plan. He carefully covered his bottom with sticky beeswax. Then he took a piece of clay pot and went to see the crows. "Please could you help me?" he asked. "I need a live coal to get my fire going again." As they were getting the coal from the fire, Anansi carefully sat firmly on one of the largest figs. It stuck to his bottom. He thanked the crows, and hurried home to enjoy the fig.
But one fig wasn't enough for him. He went back a second time, and did the same. When he went back a third time, the crows began to get suspicious. "Why do you keep coming back to us to get a coal?" they said. Anansi answered, "Every time when I get home, the coal has burnt out." "You're lying!" said the crows. "You just want our food!" "That's not true," said Anansi. And he started crying.
The crows felt sorry for him. The next morning at first light, each crow gave him a feather. He flew with them to the fig tree in the middle of the wide river. When he saw the luscious figs, Anansi wanted them all for himself. Each time a crow tried to pick a fig, he shouted out, "That one is mine! I saw it first!" And then he took the fig and put it into his bag. Eventually he had all the figs and the crows had none.
He was left all alone as the darkness began to fall. "If I don't want to stay in this tree for the rest of my life," he said to himself, "I'll just have to jump into the air like the crows." So he took a deep breath, jumped, and PLOP! He fell into the river right among the crocodiles.
"What do we have here?" said a gruff crocodile voice. "A tasty morsel to eat." "Oh please don't," said Anansi. And he began to cry. "I'm one of you, don't you know? I got lost in the days of your grandfathers and no one was able to find me. You're the first of my relatives I've ever met!" He cried so much that the crocodiles felt sorry for him.
The oldest crocodile said, "We'll know you're one of us if you can eat and enjoy mud soup just like we do." They gave him a pot of dirty brown water. "Just like my grandmother used to make it!" Anansi said. But he made a hole in the ground with his back foot, and a hole in the pot with his front foot. As he pretended to drink the soup, it oozed down through the pot into the hole beneath his feet.
"Delicious!" he exclaimed, giving back the empty pot. "Now we know you are definitely one of us," the crocodiles said. So they allowed Anansi to sleep in their hole with them for the night. "Tomorrow morning I'll tell you the story of my life," said Anansi as they fell asleep.
Early the next morning, before first light, Anansi woke up one of the crocodiles. "I want to go and fetch my wife and children from across the river, so that they can help me tell my story. Will you help me before the others wake up?" he asked the crocodile.
The crocodile was grumpy at being woken up so early. "Please help me! You swim much faster than I do," Anansi said. The crocodile agreed, and Anansi rode on his back to the bank of the river. He climbed off quickly. "I'll be back soon! Don't go away!" Anansi said, as he disappeared through the grass.
As far as we know, the crocodile is waiting for him still, with just his long snout and his beady eyes above the surface of the river.

A poor farmer had an old ox that didn't like to work. The ox didn't want to plough the farmer's field. He wanted to stay at home and eat grass, drink water and rest.
The farmer had a donkey, too. The donkey and the ox were friends. At the end of the day, the ox and the donkey talked to each other. “I'm so tired,” the ox said. “I worked hard all day. The plough is big and heavy. The farmer never lets me rest.”
The donkey thought, “The ox is lazy. He doesn't like to work.” He cried, “Do you think your plough is heavy? Believe me, my friend, it is light! I carried a sack of grain on my back today. It was heavier than your plough, I am sure.”
The next day, the two animals met again. “I had a bad day today,” the ox said. “My master's field is far away, and it was full of stones. I worked hard all day. I didn't have any rest.”
“You worked hard?” asked the donkey. “Today I travelled many kilometres to the market in the town. I'm sure I worked harder than you.”
The next day, the ox came home late again. “Oh, my friend,” he said to the donkey. “Today was a very bad day for me.” But the donkey didn't want to listen to the ox any more.
He said, “You're always tired. When the farmer comes, lie down and say, 'Moo! Moo!' He will think that you are ill. He will let you rest.” The ox liked the donkey's idea. “Thank you, dear donkey, that's a very good idea,” he said.
The next morning, the ox lay down and closed his eyes. “Moo! Moo!” he said. The farmer looked at him. “My poor old ox is sick,” he said.“ But I must plough my field. Who will help me? Perhaps the donkey! He can pull the plough today.”
The farmer tied the plough to the donkey, and began to hit him with his whip. “Go on! Faster! Pull!” he called out to the donkey. The donkey worked hard all day, and in the evening he was very tired.
The donkey slowly walked home. The ox said, “Dear donkey, I had a lovely day today. I ate some grass, drank some water and I rested. I want to rest again tomorrow. Give me another idea.”
The donkey thought, “His work is much worse than mine. I don't want to do it again tomorrow.” The donkey said, “Be careful. The farmer said 'My ox is always tired and now he is sick. If he is not better tomorrow, I will kill him, and we can eat the meat.'”
The ox was very frightened. He cried, “Really? Did he say that? Then I will work tomorrow. I feel quite better now. I'm not tired at all!”
When we go walking and the road is long, we’ll walk together singing a song.
I am with you and you are with me. A journey is fun with our family.
I’ll keep you cosy like a mother hen. She keeps her chicks warm under her wing.
If the rain starts to fall down from the sky, like that good hat I’ll keep your face dry.
If storm clouds get angry and grumble and moan, be brave, why cry? You’re not alone.
We’re walking together so we never get bored. Look up! Look around! See where we’ve explored!
If you see something that’s funny to see, I don’t want to miss it. Please share it with me!
If your feet start to hurt from the distance we’ve passed, don’t worry, we’ve made it! Here’s the clinic at last.
We all need to check our throat, lungs and ears. Get strong as you grow, it’s no reason for tears.
Do you think it’s scary? Here, hold my hand. She’ll check your blood pressure with this clever armband.
They give us our medicine, tell us what we should know, to keep us all healthy. Now back home we go.
It’s okay to be tired, there’s so much we’ve seen. Now it’s your bedtime. Sleep well and sweet dreams.

Fati was a little girlwho ran like the wind, who loved to laugh,and who always tried hard to do as she was told.
One day, Fati went on a bicycle with her father to the farm to pull some weeds.
Soon, Fati was tired. Fati said, “Father, I am hot and tired. May I sit under the mango tree? Father said, “Yes Fati, you may sit there. But, please, do not climb any trees today.”
Fati sat under the mango tree. Fati looked up. She saw one... two... three ripe mangoes!
Fati looked over at her father. He was busy and not looking her way. Quietly, Fati started to climb the mango tree.Fati thought, “I will sit on the nice, big branch. It is a good place to rest and to eat plenty of ripe mangoes.” So she sat and ate.
After she ate the mangoes, Fati climbed down... Only to see another tree.And this tree had something brown dripping down its bark.
It was honey! Fati lo-o-o-ved honey. But she did not love bees. Fati looked up and saw one little bee.Fati thought, “There is only one little bee. He will not hurt me if I climb the tree and look for honey.”
Fati looked at her father. He was not looking her way.So Fati climbed up to the top of the tree and took the honey from a deep hole.
Fati thought, “I will sit on this nice, big branch. It is a good place to rest and to eat plenty of sweet honey.” So she sat and ate.
After she ate the honey, Fati Climbed down the tree. Then she saw the bees.So many of them!BZZZ! BZZZ! BZZZ!She ran away from the bees.
Fati ran to her father.Fati was huffing and Fati was puffing.Father said, ”Fati, where have you been?” Fati did not want to say where she had been.
So, she said, “ Look, Father, I have a mango. Would you like to eat it?”Father said, “No, thank you, Fati. We must go home now. It's about to rain.”
On the way home, Fati sat behind her father on the bicycle. It started to rain.
Father went too fast on the bicycle. The bicycle went off the path. CRASH!!
The bicycle fell on Fati’s leg.
At home, mother and grandmother asked about the day at the farm."Fati climbed a tree" said father."Father went too fast on the bicycle and it fell on my leg" said Fati.
"Oh poor, poor Fati" said mother. "Poor, poor Fati," said grandmother. We must take care of your leg."And they did. And that was the end of that.
Dira and his younger brother, Chaku, were fightingover a toy elephant. The elephant belonged to Dira.“Give it back!” Dira screamed. He pushed Chaku.
Their mother was angry. “Dira, you must learn to share with your brother!”Dira stomped back to his room, climbed onto thebed, and covered himself with sheets. He dozed off.
Dira woke up early in the morning to find no one at home. He called out for his mother and brother, but there was no answer.
Dira went over to Chaku’s room. He noticed a hugecollection of toys there, like balls and cars. He even had books!Chaku also had a new pair of shoes. Dira's shoes were old. If Chaku had so much great stuff, why should Dira have to share his elephant?
Dira decided to run away.Suddenly, a large herd of elephants appeared out ofnowhere!Dira couldn't outrun them. Instead, he swung on the tusk ofone elephant, up onto his back.
Dira played with the elephants. After some time, he found Chaku kneeling under a tree.
All of a sudden, one of the elephants charged at his younger brother.Chaku jumped up. He started running, running, RUNNING!
“Chaku! Chaku!” Dira shouted. “Climb a tree!”The elephants kept charging. Chaku scrambled up the nearest tree. He was breathing heavily.“Dira!” Chaku screamed. “Brother! Please help me!”
“Tell your friend not to hurt my little brother,”Dira pleaded with his elephant.But the other elephant just snarled.
The angry elephant pulled at tree leaves. It yanked on branches, trying to toss Chaku out of the tree.Would Dira reach his brother in time?
Dira leapt from the back of his elephant into the tree. He climbed to Chaku's branch.“Take myhand!” Dira instructed.
But just as Chaku grasped Dira'shand, an elephant plucked Dira right off the branch. The elephant threw Dira to the ground!
“Mother! Help us!” the boys screamed.
Dira heard his mother's voice.“Don’t be afraid,” she said. She gave him a hug. “You just had a bad dream.”Chaku had heard the screams and run to Dira's room.“Do you want to play tomorrow morning?” Chaku asked.“Okay,” Dira smiled. “We can both play with my toy elephant.”
Goat was king of animals and birds. He called a meeting.
Goat told them that he had a dream. They all listened.
The dream was about hunger. "What shall we do?" asked Cat.
Hen and Duck said, "Let's keep food in the king's store."
King Goat said, "Tie up anyone who does not obey."
The time came to choose a new king. They chose Cat.
Goat did not want Cat as king. "I am the king," Goat said angrily.
Goat did not take food. Cow asked, "What shall we do?"
The animals and birds talked together. They were angry with Goat.
Dog said, "I was always with him when he was king."
Sheep said, "I gave his children my beautiful wool when he was king."
Pig cried, "When he was king, I looked after his garden."
"Did Goat think he will be king forever?" Sheep  asked.
The animals agreed that Goat must take food to king Cat.
The animals found Goat relaxing. Goat said, "I will always be king."
"We will tie you and take you to the new king."
Cow pulled Goat to the king's court. Others cheered.
That's why goats refuse to move when they are pulled.
Long, long ago there were seven suns in the sky. Their rays made the earth so hot that human beings could not bear it.
So, the seven brothers belonging to a tribe called the Munda decided to kill the suns. They shot arrows at them and were able to kill six of the suns.
The seventh sun hid behind a hill.
Now, with the suns gone, there was darkness everywhere. The deer could not see the tigers. The elephants bumped into trees. The rabbits walked over the lions and there was confusion all around.
To find a solution, the animals decided to have a meeting. A rabbit told them about one of the seven suns who was still alive and hiding behind a hill. But who would be the best one to call back the sun?
"I will call out to the sun," said the lion, for he was the king of the forest. "Sun, sun, please do not run away. Come back and shine on us," roared the lion. But the sun did not listen to him.
The elephant called out next. He raised his trunk and trumpeted, "Sun, sun, please come back." But the sun did not listen to him.
The peacock danced and pleaded, "Sun, sun, please come back." But the sun refused to come out. One after the other, all the animals called out to the sun. But he did not listen to any of them. Finally, a rooster offered to call the sun. Everybody laughed.
The lion said, "The rooster should be allowed to try." Rooster stepped forward and gently crowed,  "Kookoodokoo, koo." To everyone's surprise, the sun peeped out a little from behind the hill.
The rooster crowed again, this time more boldly, "KookoodoKOO-KOO." The sun came up a little higher. The rooster crowed a third time, even louder and bolder, "KOOKOODOKOO-KOO." The sun rose high and bright. There was light everywhere. The animals were delighted and the humans felt relieved.
Ever since that day, when the rooster crows in the morning, the sun rises and shines in the sky.
I have a friend. She lives in my house.
When I am happy, so is she.
When I cry, she cries too.
But I cannot hear her voice. My friend lives inside the mirror.
“Come out,” I tell her, “we will play.” She does not come out.
I am not happy. I go to sleep.
She comes out of the mirror in my sleep! And we have fun.
We play, we run, we shout and scream together.
When I talk to her, she also talks to me.
In the morning, my friend will go back into the mirror.
But I don't mind at all. We will play again in my dreams!
Once upon a time,  there was a hardworking farmer. He had a hardworking wife,  and two sons.
He had enough food because he and his wife worked very hard. He wanted his children to have a good life. He never let them do any work.
After some time,  his wife died.
The man still did not want his children to work. He did the field labour and all the housework too.
But as time went on,  the man became old and sick. He started to worry about what would become of his children when he died. They would not be able to take care of themselves.
He called his sons. He said,  "My inheritance to you is a lot of gold hidden in the fields. So,  it's up to you to plough them and find the gold."
He also called his neighbours and said,  "I'm going to die soon. My sons do not know how to look after themselves. Please look after them until they can do it for themselves."
After the man died,  the neighbours provided his sons with food for some time.
The brothers did not want to be robbed of the gold their father buried. They decided to do the digging themselves.
They dug one field after another,  but they did not find any gold.
They sat down and one asked the other,  "Do you think our father cheated us?" The other brother said,  "No,  I think our father was saying that farming is gold. And if we dig the fields,  plant,  and plough we can become rich."
So,  like all the other farmers,  they dug up the fields. They grew wheat and became very rich.

Once upon a time, there was a village called Izagodo. All the people in this village were very young. There was not a single old man or old woman in the village.
The young men and women of Izagodo danced and had fun. They ate what they liked and drank anything that made them drunk. They had fun all day and all night.Very soon, they forgot how to work.
They also forgot anything that happened the day before.The young men and women of Izagodo woke up one day and all the food was finished. There was not a drop of wine left. The musical instruments were all broken.
There was no music for dancing. But they couldn't even dance anymore because they were hungry and weak.They went to the compound of Oza, the village chief, and cried bitterly.
They cried and wailed.The young chief came out of his large hut and pleaded, "Stop! Dear people of Izagodo. Please stop crying. We might die soon, let us save our strength for a few more breaths."
The people shouted, "You are our chief! You must save us!"Chief Oza was quiet. Then after a while, he stood up and said, "I am no longer your chief. I shall leave this village and find somewhere peaceful. You can choose another chief."
So Oza went into his hut, packed his things, and left.The people did not know who would be their leader. They did not know what to do. They cried so much more.
Then a small but clear voice said, "I will be your chief!" Everybody turned to look for the owner of the voice. They all looked to each other. They looked and looked. But they could not tell who had spoken.
To the surprise of everyone, a little boy stepped out of the crowd. The boy said, "Yes! I will be chief. I can help you. But you must promise to stop having fun all day and all night. And you must follow my advice."
The young people were moved by the child's courage and promised to obey him.He took them away from the village, to a lush farm. They had food and rested. Then he taught them. He helped them to remember how to farm.
With the little boy as their chief, the people of Izagodo began a life of hard work. They worked and worked. Before long, they had more than enough to eat and drink. They were happy again and had fun. But also they continued to work.
Many nights the little chief would quietly leave the village, to meet with a wise old man.He told him moonlight tales, and stories of great men and women who solved the problems of their people. In time, the boy himself became a wise and powerful man.

The clever Rabbit was awake inside his hutch. He was thinking, “I want to explore the outside world.” The other rabbits were dozing.
The door to their hutch opened. The farmer came in. It was meal time for the rabbits.
The food smelled nice. All the other rabbits were awake now. They hopped closer to the farmer.
The clever Rabbit watched the farmer walk out the hutch. “Aha! Now I know how I can sneak out. Tomorrow I must get out of here.”
“I’ll hop into the basket when the farmer brings in food,” the clever Rabbit thought. The other rabbits quickly finished their meal and fell asleep.
In the morning, the farmer brought in food for the rabbits. “Today is the day,” the clever Rabbit thought to himself. “I must get out of this hutch.”As soon as the farmer put the basket down, the clever Rabbit quickly jumped in. No one saw him. After the farmer had fed the other rabbits, he carried the basket outside.
The cleverRabbit was finally free! He sang to himself. He walked around like a king. Suddenly, a dog came up to the clever Rabbit and started barking at him.The clever Rabbit hadn’t thought of this danger.
The dog chased the clever Rabbit, who ran and ran and ran.
The clever Rabbit just managed to outrun the dog.
The clever Rabbit was now in the forest. He found some tender, sweet grass to eat. Food had never tasted so good back in the hutch. Full, he dozed off.
The clever Rabbit was awakened by the loud roaring of a lion. “Ngrrrrr! Ngrrrr!” The sound was terribly scary.
The lion was hungry. He chased the clever Rabbit. The clever Rabbit ran for his life. “Will I escape alive?” he wondered. The clever Rabbit ran all night long.
When it was daybreak, the clever Rabbit couldn't believe his eyes. He was back at the farmer's house!
The door to the hutch was open. He saw the farmer feeding the other rabbits.
The clever Rabbit snuck in behind the farmer.
He was starving. He ate till he was full again. “I know better now. The outside world is sweet, but also bitter,” he told himself.
From that day on, the clever Rabbit learned more and more about his world inside the farm. He even advised other rabbits on their issues!
I can swim with it.
I can dance with it.
I can swing with it.
I can get eats using my body.
I can skip with it.
I can bath my doll with it.
I can make mats with it.
I can move with it but i can not fly with it.

Tamara was obedient to her parents. She looked after sheep and goats.
Tamara loved listening to birds singing as she took care of the animals. As the birds sang, she put her own words to the tune.

In the distance she saw light coming from a hut. She walked quickly towards it and knocked at the door.

The dog said,  "Cook for me!" "But I've never cooked for a dog before," Nozibele answered. "Cook,  or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele cooked some food for the dog.
Then the dog said,  "Make the bed for me!" Nozibele answered,  "I've never made a bed for a dog." "Make the bed,  or I'll bite you!" the dog said. Nozibele made the bed.
Every day she had to cook and sweep and wash for the dog. Then one day the dog said,  "Nozibele,  today I have to visit some friends. Sweep the house,  cook the food and wash my things before I come back."
As soon as the dog had gone,  Nozibele took three hairs from her head. She put one hair under the bed,  one behind the door,  and one in the kraal. Then she ran home as fast as she could.
When the dog came back,  he looked for Nozibele. "Nozibele,  where are you?" he shouted. "I'm here,  under the bed," said the first hair. "I'm here,  behind the door," said the second hair. "I'm here,  in the kraal," said the third hair.
The dog knew that Nozibele had tricked him. He ran and ran all the way to the village. But Nozibele's brothers were waiting there with big sticks. The dog turned and ran away and has never been seen since.

In those days,  there were merchants who went everywhere. They travelled in the cold weather and hot weather. They crossed hills and deserts and bushy areas,  selling and buying things. These merchants were very careful when they travelled. They were afraid of bandits and robbers so they went in groups.
One merchant couldn't find a group so he decided to go alone. He met a bandit and he was afraid. "Who are you? Are you alone?" asked the bandit. "I am a merchant. My friends are ahead,  but right now I am alone," replied he merchant.
At that time another merchant arrived from a different direction. He saw the bandit and was afraid. He hid himself in the bushes and watched. The bandit killed the first merchant and buried him. The second merchant thought,  "How can I go on? The same thing will happen to me." So he stayed there for some time. Later he thought,  "I can't stay here forever. I must go on."
He passed where the bandit had killed the merchant and reached a village. He was so upset by what had seen that he couldn't smile or talk to people. People asked him,  "You used to be cheerful,  but now you are sad. Why?" "I'm tired and thirsty," he said.
He stayed the night there. The next morning he continued with his journey. The people kept asking him,  "What's wrong?" He thought to himself,  "Shall I tell them or not?" At last he told the villagers.
The villagers realised that the bandit was a man from their village. They said,  "It's terrible for this to happen here. We'll try to find out who the dead man is."  But they didn't say anything about the bandit.
This merchant told the villagers,  "I saw someone burying a man. I didn't know who it was or who the bandit was. I will never come back to this place."
The ruler of the village heard about how merchants were being stopped by bandits,  killed and buried. He was worried. "How can bandits do this to strangers in my territory?" So he tried to solve the problem. "I will try to catch the bandit by arranging a feast and calling everyone together," thought the ruler.
This ruler was loved by all his people. He arranged a feast for everyone in the village. At the feast,  the ruler stood up and said,  "My daughter is sick. The only medicine for her is fresh tiringo (a citrus fruit). The fruit should grow near a river,  close to bushes and trees,  in a place where no one lives. Can any of you bring such a fruit to me?"
Everyone was thinking,  "Where could I find a tiringo like that?" They didn't say anything. But the bandit immediately stood up and said,  "Your excellency,  I know of that fruit growing in such a place. Give me a time of two weeks."
The bandit went at once to the place where he buried the merchant because a tiringo tree was there. He rushed to get the fruit before anyone else could find it. He put two bunches of fruit in a sack and ran to meet the ruler.
After two or three days of waiting at the gates he was finally allowed to see the ruler. "I have brought what you wanted,  so please take it," offered the bandit. The ruler said,  "I am happy you brought the fruit,  but I want you to give it to me in front of my people."
The ruler called the people from the villages around to go to his palace. As people ate and drank,  he said,  "This man has kept his promise as you heard. He said he would bring the special fruit and he has got it. I want to receive this great gift in front of you all."
The people thought the bandit would get a reward. They were jealous of him. They wondered how he got the fruit. The bandit opened the sack to give the fruit to the ruler. When he took out two fruits,  they were tiringos,  but as he gave them to the ruler they became two human skulls!
When that happened all the people were angry and the bandit was surprised. The ruler smiled. He had wished for a long time to catch those who robbed and killed near his village. The ruler had prayed saying,  "Please,  show me,  who is this bandit?"
So,  that day,  at the feast,  his God showed him. The ruler knew the man was a killer. He ordered his people to take him to jail.
Once upon a time, there was a boy who was so ugly that nobody loved him. Not even his parents. At home,  he would sit alone while his family watched television.
At school, he would sit alone while other children were playing.
He would walk alone behind the other boys when they went to fetch the cattle. They didn't want to walk with him.
One day he decided to leave home. He walked until he got to an indigenous forest. He started to feel scared, but was comforted by the thought that nobody would speak to him. Because nobody loved him.
He was about to enter the forest when an old, dirty,  ugly woman came up to him. She greeted him and asked why he was going into the scary forest. The boy was shocked to hear someone speaking to him. He told the old woman that he wasn't going anywhere. Because no one loved him.
The old woman asked if he needed help. He quickly said, "Yes." The old woman said that before she helped him, she wanted him to lick her face until she was clean and beautiful.
The boy didn't have any other choice in order to get the help he needed. He licked the sleep from her eyes,  the snot from her nose, and the wax from her ears. He licked her face until she was clean and beautiful.
The old woman thanked him. She said, "You will find many wonderful things in the forest, but don't take any of these things. Only bring back the root that you find."
The boy ran, wanting to see all of the things in the forest. Before he could enter the forest, the old woman called him. She said, "Boy! Come back here!" He ran back to her. She repeated, "Don't take any of the wonderful things in the forest. Only bring back the root that you find." The boy nodded and ran off.
Before he could enter the forest, he heard a voice saying, "Boy! Come back here!" He started to feel confused about what the old woman wanted. He ran back to her again. She said, "You will find many wonderful things in the forest. But only bring back the root that you find." The boy nodded and ran off.
Just after he had entered the forest, he heard a voice saying, "Boy! Come back here!" He again went back to the old woman. She said, "Listen to me. Only bring back the root that you find. Don't take anything else from the forest." The boy was annoyed with the repetition. He ran into the forest.
Once he was in the forest, he saw a bowl filled with money. He took the money and put it in his pocket. All of a sudden, he thought about what the old woman said. He took the money out of his pocket and put it back in the bowl.
He continued walking. He saw some splendid new clothes. He took off his clothes and put on the new ones. Then he thought about what the old woman had said. He took off the new clothes and put his old ones back on.
Next he saw the root. It was withered from the sun. He asked himself what the old woman thought he would do with the root. Next to the root, there was a bowl of food. The food smelled delicious and the boy was hungry. He couldn't stop himself from eating.
When he had finished,  he remembered what the old woman had told him. The old woman had said he must only take the root. He looked around for the root, but he couldn't see it anymore.
The boy left the forest feeling disappointed. He went back to tell the old woman what had happened. But the old woman was gone.
Knock! Knock!
"Who is there?" I ask sleepily.
"It is me," a shrill voice says.
"Who is 'me'?" I ask.
"I told you, it is o-n-l-y m-e," the same voice says.
"I don't know anyone called, 'o-n-l-y m-e'," I reply. I check that my mosquito net is tucked in around my bed.
"Well, my name is Amos." The voice sounds more shrill than before. It is very close to my ear.
"Amos who?" I ask as I look under the net.
"Amos Quito," the voice finally says. I feel a bite on my ear.
"Ouch!" I jump up and begin to search."You will pay for this!" I shout.
Angrily, I get out ofbed and switch on the light.
I declare war on the annoying Amos Quito!
﻿I lost my bat.    I cant find it anywhere.
I searched behind the door.    It's not there.
I checked on the shelf.   couldn't find it there.
﻿Searched under the cot.    It's not there either.
﻿checked in the box.     There is no trace of it.
Searched the whole loft.     couldn't find it there too.
﻿I searched for it everywhere.     couldn't find it anywhere.      There, It's in my sister's hand.
Everybody knew Mama Schola in the village.They also knew that she had a loud voice.
That day, there were cows at the market. "Push these silly cows away," Mama Schola said. "They are eating my vegetables."
"Hey you there! Push these silly cows away from here," she insisted. "They are eating my clothes."
"Where is the owner of these silly cows?" she shouted. "They are eating my grains."
Sorimpan, the herd boy, had just gone to drink water at a tap when his cows wandered off to the market. He hid away, squatting in fear, when he heard the shouting woman.
"Now look what these silly cows have done!" she continued to shout. "They have broken my beautiful pots."
A short time later, "Aah! Not again!" she was heard saying. "I will report this matter to the police. These silly cows have knocked down my fruit stand."
Sorimpan finally came out, stick in hand. He dodged between the gathering crowds and managed to get a clear view of his cows. Sorimpan's cows knew him well so they turned and looked up at him as he approached!
At this point, there was a crowd of onlookers of men, women and even children. They all stared at the cows which paid attention only to Sorimpan.
Suddenly, the cows broke their silence! They began to talk all at the same time, criticising the people!
The crowds were shocked and stepped back one by one, afraid of the cows. Then the cows stopped talking and watched the crowd in amazement! But Mama Schola was heard saying, "Since when did cows meddle in our market businesses?"
It was Mama Schola's turn to be criticised by the cows! All the other women selling moved to stand with Mama Schola out of fear.
The cows criticised the women, commenting on the state of their vegetables, saying, "What kind of vegetables are these? They are all old and drying up!"
It was clear that the cows were not yet done! They turned round and faced the cloth-stand and shouted, "You say we eat your clothes, what clothes? You mean these old rugs! Who will buy them?"
The cows then moved to the next stand and everybody followed them with their eyes. "Your grains are full of weevils. Who wants to eat that! We only tasted to see if this is a place to come more often!" the cows sneered.
"And you Mama Schola," the cows continued, "stop making noise. You talk of these cracked pots?" The cows turned their heads towards Mama Schola's pots. "They are no good, they break so easily, so don't blame us." With that, the cows turned and left, followed closely by Sorimpan.
“This year we are going to have a special family gathering,” announced Mom Polygon. “Who is coming? I hope all the Polygons will be there. I miss my cousins,” said Khosi. “I miss my side of the family the most, the Quadrilaterals,” smiled Mom. “Yes, it’s a long time since we saw Rectangle, Square, and Rhombus,” said Dad Polygon. “Don’t forget, they have three children now!” Mom reminded Dad.
“What about cousin Scalene and her children? Are they coming?” asked Vusi. Mom answered, “Yes, they are Polygons, although they are not Quadrilaterals. Their surname is Triangle. The kids are Isosceles and Equilateral.” “Oh yes, the Triangle family!” exclaimed Vusi. “But they look a lot like the Quadrilaterals.” “No, not exactly,” said Mom. “Triangles have three sides, while the Quadrilaterals have four sides, like me.”
Dad Polygon added, “I am excited because my three other cousins will be here, they are Pentagon, Hexagon and Octagon. They are also part of our Polygon family.” Vusi asked, “Dad, why we are called Polygons?” “We are called polygons because we are 2-dimensional shapes. We are made of straight lines, and our shape is closed, as you can see, all our lines join up. Our cousins the Triangles, the Quadrilaterals, the Hexagons and the Pentagons will all be visiting,” replied Dad.
“Did you say that is Octagon coming? Is she also our relative?” asked Khosi. “Of course my daughter, by just looking at her you can see she belongs to our family. You need to look carefully at the number of sides your cousins have, otherwise you might not be able to see the difference. Cousin Octagon has eight sides because her name starts with Octa,” said Dad.
“Okay, what about Pentagon and Hexagon?” asked Vusi. “Cousin Hexagon has six sides because his name starts with Hexa,” replied Dad. “Pentagons have five sides. Our teacher told us that Penta means ‘five’,” added Khosi. “And remember that Tri means three and Quad means four. That’s what makes your Triangle and Quadrilateral cousins look different,” said Mom.
“Dad, how many sides does Heptagon have?” asked Vusi. Dad laughed and said, “I am not going to tell you. Remember we took a photograph with them at your uncle's wedding. I want you to look at the photograph carefully and tell me what you observe.” Vusi looked at the photograph and quickly answered, “Heptagon has seven sides!” Khosi added, “Yes, remember our teacher told us that Hepta means ‘seven’.”
“Oh my wife, can you see how clever our children are? Okay, what about Deca, what does it mean?” questioned Dad. “Ten! Ten!” shouted Vusi and Khosi together. “Yes, that's why one of your cousins is called Decagon, but he is not coming because he has to represent the swimming team. There are so few Decagons at their school,” Mom told them.
Then the children asked, “Mom and Dad, can we invite our friend Circle from next door?” Their parents agreed that Circle was welcome to join the family gathering. Just then they heard a knock at the front door, and Dad got up to check. “The Quadrilaterals are here! Welcome! Welcome” called Dad.
The rest of the family jump up to greet Square, Rectangle and the three Rhombus children. The Quadrilaterals are happy to arrive first.
The Triangle family knock on the door soon after the Quadrilaterals. Scalene, Isosceles and Equilateral are tired after their long journey, but they are so pleased to be with the rest of the family.
Finally, Octagon and Heptagon arrive with their children, two Pentagons and Hexagon. They have also brought three Squares with them. Octagon explained, “I hope you don’t mind that three Quadrilateral children from the village have come with us. They have never visited the city before.” “Friends and family are always welcome here,” smiled Mom. Then she sent all the children outside to play.
“What game are we going to play?” Vusi asked the other children. Equilateral squealed, “Let's play the tessellation game!” All the Polygon children started to tessellate. “Can I play with you? I also want to tessellate,” said Circle. Vusi said, “Shame, I’m sorry you can't tessellate my friend.” One of the Squares added, “Can’t you see your shape, you are not a Polygon. Circles can't tessellate.”
Circle was sad and felt left out. It's not so much fun playing together when someone is left out. Vusi said, “Hey guys, let's rather play a game that Circle can also play.” So the Polygons and Circle played happily together until the delicious food was ready.
When Asiimwe was still young, her mother loved her very much. She used to make her sleep on a good mat.
This mat was special. It was made of palm leaves in different colours.
The land around Asiimwe's home was dry and hot.There were many snakes, spiders and scorpions, but they didn't harm her.
According to her mother, Asiimwe's mat protected her.
Asiimwe started going to the local well. She also knew her grandmother's home and loved visiting her.
By bad luck, one day Asiimwe got lost on her way to her grandmother's home.
She sat down under a musisa tree and waited for help. While waiting, she fell asleep.
She started dreaming of a woman who looked like her grandmother. She was very happy.
When she woke up, she saw a bird and heard it calling her, "Asiimwe, Asiimwe, wake up and go home."
The bird flew while dropping a piece of mat that looked like Asiimwe's mat. Asiimwe followed the bird.
The bird led Asiimwe safely back home. Her family celebrated her return.
One day, Anansi the spider picked up some yams in his garden. They were very beautiful and very good yams.He cooked them carefully on the fire. Then he sat down to eat them.
As Anansi was about to eat the first bite, he heard someone knock on the door. "Oh no !" Anansi thought. "Who could it be?" But he opened the door. It was Turtle who looked very tired. "Anansi, please let me in. I've walked so far today and I'm so tired and hungry," Turtle said. So what could Anansi do except let him in?
Anansi was too selfish to share his beautiful and good yams with anyone. So he came up with a nasty plan.As Turtle sat down at the table and started reaching out to grab some yams, Anansi shouted at him, "Turtle, your hands are all dirty! You can't eat with your hands all dirty! Go wash them."Turtle's hands were really dirty. So he crawled gently towards the river, washed his hands and then crawled back to the table.
But meanwhile, Anansi had started swallowing the yams. When Turtle returned, he saw that the yams were gone.Turtle looked at Anansi. "Thank you for inviting me to dinner. If you ever come near my house, come see me and let me make this dinner for you," he told him. And Turtle started crawling slowly towards his house.
After some time, Anansi began to think more and more about the free dinner promised by Turtle. So one day he went to visit.Anansi arrived at Turtle's house at dinner time as the sun was setting over the river. Turtle was lying on a rock in the sun, warming himself like turtles do.When Turtle saw Anansi, he said, "Hello, Anansi, did you come to eat with me?"And Anansi replied, "Yes, that would be very nice, thank you." He was getting hungrier and hungrier.
So Turtle dived to the bottom of the river to set the table for dinner and get everything ready. Anansi waited on the rocks on the bank.Soon Turtle came swimming back and said, "Oh Anansi, it's ready now, come have dinner with me."And Turtle dived again and started eating the green leaves prepared for dinner.
Anansi tried to dive to the bottom of the river, but it was a spider, not a turtle, and he couldn't dive that deep. He always came to the surface.He tried to jump into the river, he tried to dive, but nothing helped. He couldn't come down to eat that dinner.
Finally, Anansi had an idea. He put many stones in his coat pockets and was heavy enough to sink to the bottom of the river. How clever he was!He saw Turtle's table, full of juicy green leaves and lots of other delicious foods. Anansi's mouth was watering.
But just as Anansi grabbed some of that delicious food, Turtle stopped him. "Anansi, aren't you going to dinner with your coat on? We don't do that at home."Anansi, without thinking, replied, "Oh, of course you're right, Turtle, what was I thinking?" He took off his coat.
But without the stones in his pockets to hold him down, Anansi immediately rose to the surface of the river and found himself out of the water. Anansi sadly put her head in the water and watched Turtle eat all the delicious food!
Once upon a time, there was an old woman who loved her grandson very much. She gave him an egg as a gift. She said, “From this egg you will get bride wealth for your marriage when you are of age.” And the boy went on his way.
First he met some blackberry gatherers who asked him for the egg. They used it to shoot at the berries and it broke.
The boy cried, “EiEiEi! You have caused trouble for me! The egg was not mine. It belonged to my grandmother. And grandmother didn't give it to me for nothing. She gave it to me to get bride wealth.”
So the berry gatherers gave him the stick they used to bring down the berries. And the boy walked on.
Next the boy met some builders who asked him for his stick. They used it to build a house and it broke into pieces.
The boy cried, “HeeHeeHee! You have caused trouble for me! The stick was not mine, it belonged to the berry gatherers. And they didn’t give it to me for nothing. They gave it to me in place of my egg. The egg was not mine. It belonged to my grandmother. And grandmother didn’t give it to me for nothing, She gave it to me to get bride wealth.”
So the builders gave him a bundle of grass for thatching. And the boy walked on.
Next the boy found a herdsman who asked for the boy's bundle of grass. The herdsman gave it to the cow and the cow ate it all up.
The boy cried, “EEE! You have caused trouble for me! The grass was not mine. It belonged to the builders. The builders did not give it to me for nothing. They broke my stick. The stick was not mine. It belonged to the berry gatherers. And they didn't give it to me for nothing. They gave it to me in place of my egg. The egg was not mine. It belonged to my grandmother. And grandmother did not give it to me for nothing. She gave it to me to get bride wealth.”
So the herdsman gave the boy his cow. And the boy walked on.
While on his way home, the boy came across a marriage celebration. The bride's family asked him for his cow. He gave it to them. And they slaughtered it and ate it all.
The boy cried, “EiEiEi! You have caused trouble for me! The cow was not mine. It belonged to the herdsman. The herdsman didn't give it to me for nothing. He gave it to me in place of my bundle of grass. The grass was not mine. It belonged to the builders. The builders didn't give it to me for nothing. They broke my stick. The stick was not mine. It belonged to the berry gatherers. They didn't give it to me for nothing. They gave it to me in place of my egg. The egg was not mine. It belonged to my grandmother. And grandmother didn't give it to me for nothing, She gave it to me to get bride wealth.”
Then the bride's family said, “We have nothing left to pay you. But let us give you the bride." And so, the saying came to pass that, "What goes round comes around!”
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Kay. Kay's parents were brilliant scientists. They were working on a top secret project in their laboratory.
An evil scientist called Dr Devious wanted to know the secret of the secret project. One dark night, Dr Devious sent her accomplice Dan Diabolical to kidnap Kay's parents.
Dan got the parents. He almost got Kay, but she was small and fast. She managed to slip through his fingers. Kay ran like a lightening bolt.
When she stopped running, Kay found herself in a dark forest surrounded by trees.As she looked up to see the sky, Kay tripped and fell!
She fell down, down, down, and bumped her head.When Kay woke up, she was in a nice room with a big TV.
"Hello Kay," said the man on the TV. "I am a secret agent for World Good! You are our newest secret agent!" With those words, Kay grew as brave as a wolf.
After her parents returned home, Kay went to the tree to find the man on TV.She found the tree, but there was no door.Kay sat down and looked up into the trees.
It had been raining for days, and everyone was grumpy. Everyone except Sizwe, who woke up with a smile every morning. "Yoh! Sizwe! That smile is magic!" said Gogo. "Is it for me?" Sizwe clapped his hand over his mouth. "But it's MY smile, Gogo," he whispered.
His mother laughed. "Sizwe! A smile is something you can give away without losing it. Look!" She lifted him up to the mirror. There was his smile, just as bright as before.
It was time to go out. Mama buttoned up Sizwe's raincoat, and off they went, through the rain,  to the library. Down the street, Sizwe's best friend Zanele stood at the window of her house,  looking sadly at the rain. Sizwe felt his smile creeping, creeping up. Before he knew it, his smile LEAPT out, and flew across the garden to Zanele.
Zanele held on tightly to the smile – it was far too precious to let it get away. As Sizwe walked away to the library, Zanele's doorbell rang. It was the postman, with a letter from her favourite cousin. Zanele was so happy, that the smile bounced up,  and beamed out at the postman. "Thank you,  Mister Postman!" she said.
Zanele's smile was the brightest thing the postman had seen all morning. It kept him warm as he trudged off through the rain. He came to a big house. Inside the gate, a dog was spinning around in circles, barking, barking, barking. He was so silly,  that the postman couldn't help smiling. The smile bounced through the gate with a glitter of glee.
The dog stopped barking. He pricked up his ears and wagged his tail. Then he turned and ran back to the house with the precious, warm smile. A bent old man opened the door. "Oh,  no! You can't come inside. You're all wet!" he told the dog. But right away, the smile beamed up at the old man.
The old man stood a little straighter. "Eish," he said,  "Who cares if it's raining? Let's go for a walk,  boy!" And off they went, splashing in the puddles. There,  at the zebra crossing, stood grumpy Mrs Makabela,  the traffic cop. She looked cold, and wet,  and miserable. The old man knew just what to do. "Morning, Mrs Makabela!" he called, and smiled his biggest, brightest smile. But Mrs Makabela did not smile back.
A great, big smile lit up Mrs Makabela's face! The school bell rang, and children ran to cross the road. Mrs Makabela put up her sign, and smiled, and smiled, at each and every child.
The children smiled at their moms and dads, and their gogos and tatas and brothers and sisters. They smiled at the bus driver and the greengrocer, and Mme Makau, who went off to smile at her husband,  who smiled at the mayor. The smiles leapt and rolled and beamed and gleamed until EVERYONE was smiling and giggling and laughing out loud in the rain.
In the library, everything was quiet except for the sound of the rain. "It's time to go," said Sizwe's mother, closing her book. "Aw,  mom!" said Sizwe,  who had run out of smiles.
But as they stepped out into the street  WHAT A SIGHT! Everyone in town was there! Everyone!  And they were ALL smiling!
The smiles bounced around and beamed at Sizwe. They warmed him, and tickled him, and crept up,  up, up from his toes to the TOP of his head. He was so full of happiness that the smile burst out, brilliant and beaming bright. And something changed. The dark, gloomy, rainy afternoon didn't seem so dark anymore. Could it be? YES! The clouds parted,  and the warm sun shone down on them, with the biggest, brightest, most brilliant smile of all.

Goat, Dog and Cow were great friends.One day they went on a journey in a taxi.
They reached the end of their journey.The driver asked them to pay their fares.Cow paid her fare.
Dog paid extra, because he did not have the correct money.
The driver was about to give Dog his change.Suddenly Goat ran away without paying.
The driver was very annoyed.He drove away without giving Dog his change.
That is why, even today, Dog runs towards a car to peep inside.He is looking for the driver who owes him change.
Goat runs away from the sound of a car.She is afraid she will be arrested for not paying her fare.
Cow is not bothered by cars.Cow takes her time crossing the road.She knows she paid her fare in full.
Once upon a time, there was a man called Byantaka who had a cow. Each day Byantaka grazed his cow. He also gave the cow water to drink. But Byantaka only had a very small pot for water.
So he went at his neighbour's home to borrow a bigger pot for water. His neighbour agreed to lend Byantaka his biggest clay pot saying, "My neighbour's problem is my problem."
After a few days, Byantaka went to apotter's place and bought a small pot. He took it home. He put the small pot inside the big pot that he had borrowed from his neighbour.
Then he put the big pot, with the small pot inside it,on his head. He carried the big pot to the neighbour who loaned him the pot.
Byantaka told him, "I am returning your pot, it has reproduced." The neighbour was amazed that his pot had produced another pot. He praised Byantaka saying, "Your home is blessed."
After a while, Byantaka went back to his neighbour to borrow the pot again. He did not have good intentions.
The owner of the big pot waited in vain for Byantaka to return his pot. Eventually he went to Byantaka's home and said, "I have come for my pot."
Byantaka told his neighbour, "My friend, our pot died. I was just on my way to tell you the bad news."
His neighbour clapped his hands together in surprise. His face began to swell with anger. He shouted at Byantaka, "I have never heard of a pot dying!"
Byantaka replied, "My friend you should accept these things. Everything that produces must die. I was also very sorry about the big pot's death."
His neighbour was very angry and he went to court to report Byantaka. The judge listened to explanations from both of them. He found the owner of the pot was in the wrong.
"When Byantaka told you that the pot had reproduced, you accepted. When he says that every living thing which reproduces must die, he is correct." That is how the judge judged the case.
Byantaka's neighbour went home walking like a snail. Byantaka had got the big pot with his cleverness.
Odongo and Apiyo lived in the city with their father. They looked forward to the holidays. Not only because school was closed, but because they went to visit their grandmother. She lived in a fishing village near a large lake.
Odongo and Apiyo were excited because it was time to visit their grandmother again. They packed their bags and got ready for their long journey the next day. They could not sleep and talked about the holiday the whole night.
Early the next morning, they left for the village in their father's car. They drove past mountains, wild animals, and tea plantations. They counted cars and sang songs.
After a while, the children were tired and fell asleep.
Father woke up Odongo and Apiyo as they arrived in the village. They found Nyar-Kanyada, their grandmother, resting on a mat under a tree. In thier language, Nyar-Kanyada means “daughter of the people of Kanyada.” She was a strong and beautiful woman.
Nyar-Kanyada welcomed them into the house. She danced around the room singing with joy. Her grandchildren were excited to give her the presents they brought from the city. “First open my gift,” said Odongo. “No, my gift first!” said Apiyo.
After she opened the presents, Nyar-Kanyada blessed her grandchildren in a traditional way.
Then Odongo and Apiyo went outside. They chased butterflies and birds.
They climbed trees and splashed in the water of the lake.
When it was dark they returned to the house for dinner. Before they could finish eating, they were falling asleep!
The next day, the children's father drove back to the city leaving them with Nyar-Kanyada.
Odongo and Apiyo helped their grandmother with household chores. They fetched water and firewood. They collected eggs from the chickens and picked vegetables from the garden.
Nyar-Kanyada taught her grandchildren to make soft ugali to eat with stew. She showed them how to make coconut rice to eat with roast fish.
One morning, Odongo took his grandmother's cows to graze. They ran onto a neighbour's farm. The farmer was angry with Odongo. He threatened to keep the cows for eating his crops. After that day, the boy made sure that the cows did not get into trouble again.
On another day, the children went to the market place with Nyar­Kanyada.She had a stall selling vegetables, sugar and soap. Apiyo liked to tell customers the price of items. Odongo would pack the items that customers bought.
At the end of the day they drank chai tea together. They helped grandmother to count the money she earned.
But too soon the holidays were over. The children had to go back to the city. Nyar-Kanyada gave Odongo a cap and Apiyo a sweater. She packed food for their journey.
When their father came to fetch them, they did not want to leave. The children begged Nyar-Kanyada to go with them to the city. She smiled and said, “I am too old for the city. I will be waiting for you to visit me again.”
Odongo and Apiyo both hugged her tightly, and said goodbye.
When Odongo and Apiyo went back to school they told their friends about life in the village. Some children felt that life in the city was good. Others felt that the village was better. But most of all, everyone agreed that Odongo and Apiyo had a wonderful grandmother!
One day Akadeli, Lucy, Acharait and Mary went to pick wild fruits. They held hands to cross the big river.
The girls found a tree full of ripe fruits. They agreed to pick the fruits with their eyes closed.
Lucy, Acharait and Mary did not close their eyes. Only Akadeli closed hers.
When they opened their eyes, only Akadeli had picked unripe fruits.
Lucy, Acharait and Mary laughed at Akadeli. They left for home. Akadeli threw away the unripe fruits. She began picking ripe ones.
Soon, Akadeli filled her basket with ripe fruits. She set off alone, crossing the big river.
Half way across the river, Akadeli's fruits fell into the water. She was angry and began to cry.
Akadeli saw a big fish and grabbed it.
As Akadeli walked home, a hawk snatched the fish. He flew away with it.
The hawk left behind a feather from its tail. Akadeli picked up the feather and continued walking home.
She came across a traditional wedding. Dancers were wearing grass on their heads instead of feathers as was the tradition. They took her feather and gave her a big bull!
Akadeli reached home with her bull. Her parents and relatives were so happy. Lucy, Acharait and Mary wished they had not lied to Akadeli. It was a lucky day for Akadeli!

The elephant arrives at the river. He asks, "How can I get to the other side of the river?" Sara says, "Get in my canoe!" The elephant gets in the canoe. The canoe fills up with water.
The canoe is too small. There isn't enough room.
Sara says, "Hold on! First I'll take the women."
Sara says, "Second, I'll take the men."
Sara says, "Finally, I'll take the animals."
The elephant says, "I'm just going to walk!"

Long time ago, in a Turkana village, people loved to dance edonga, the traditional dance.
Every evening they gathered together and danced edonga. The whole region came to know of this village and its dancers.
People from nearby villages also came to this village to dance.
A stranger heard of the famous village. He sent his messenger to go there before him.
When the messenger arrived, the villagers were afraid. They wondered who the stranger was, and why he had sent his messenger. The villagers prepared food and animals to be slaughtered.
The villagers gathered and waited. They sat the whole day until evening. But the stranger did not arrive.
That night, the villagers danced as usual until midnight. That night there were many dancers. Everybody in the village was excited.
While they were dancing, the stranger arrived. Although he was a stranger, he looked just like the other villagers. They did not notice him at first.
When it was the stranger's turn to dance, he joined the men. But his dancing was strange and different from the others.
People were amused and began to laugh at the stranger. Some dancers fell down laughing. Some sat down, and others knelt laughing.
The stranger did not like people laughing at him. He decided to curse them. He stopped dancing and everyone became a stone in the position they were in. Some were lying down, others standing, others sitting and kneeling. Then the stranger left the village.
Bahati is a forgetful girl.
Today, she is searching for something special. She says, “I’m looking for something, Dad.”
“What is it?” Dad asks.
Bahati can't remember what she is looking for. “It's… something nice,” Bahati replies.“I will know it when I see it.  I looked for it in thekitchen, but it’s not there.”
“It’s not in the cupboard either!” Bahati exclaims. “Where did I put it?”
“I’ll keep searching for it,” Bahati says. “Dad, have you seen it?”
Dad tries to help her.“Are you looking for this candy?” Dad asks.
“No,” Bahati says. “It’s much more valuable than candy.”
“I think I know!” Dad says.“You are looking for a pencil, aren't you?Do you want to draw?”
“Ha ha ha!” Bahati laughs. “I found it! It’s a book! The cat had it all along.”
My name is Kobole.I live in a small village.
I was out picking fruits when I saw something I had never seen before.
There were colourful lines in the sky.
I dropped all the fruit and ran to tell people at home.
People were standing outside surprised.
I said happily, “It is a beautiful sheet hanging from the sky.” “No! I think someone is pouring paint from the sky.” Neno said.
Some people agreed with me. Others thought Neno was right. We began to argue.
A man from a faraway village said, "You are all wrong."
We shouted, “Tell us what it is if we are wrong.”
The stranger said, “It is the rainbow. Have you never seen the rainbow before?”
We asked the stranger, “What is a r-a-i-n-b-o-w?”
Neno asked, “Is it ours? Can we keep it here?” We never got answers to our questions because the man had left.

Father bought brother fancy glasses. Mother bought me a bright blue cap. The baby got sugar candy.
On the way home,  a very strong wind came. It blew my cap away.
My cap got stuck on a branch of a big old tree.
I cried a lot. And I did not eat my dinner.
Later that night,  the moon came up. It looked at my cap in the big old tree.
The moon tried on my cap. It smiled happily. I had to smile too.
After school the next day,  my mother gave me a shiny new red cap. "The moon sent it," she said.
That night,  both the moon and I wore our caps and smiled. We were happy.
Do you think the sun needs a hat?
Guess which cap I am wearing today!
Once upon a time in a big palace,  there lived a king and his beautiful daughter,  the princess.
Elephant lived in a house on one side of the palace. Chameleon lived on the other side.
At this time,  there was a terrible drought across the land. The king had an idea and called his two neighbours to the palace.
The kind said to Elephant and Chameleon,  "I want you to stomp on the ground with your feet until water comes out." The king promised the princess in marriage to the one who succeeded.
Chameleon had no hope since he was very small. Elephant was extremely happy since he was so big and powerful. Elephant went to the field and started stomping on the ground.
A lot of dust came,  but no water. Elephant stomped on the ground until water was almost coming out,  but he was too tired. He gave Chameleon a chance to try.
Chameleon started stomping on the ground. After a short while,  water came out. People could not believe their eyes!
So the King gave the beautiful princess to Chameleon. Elephant went home annoyed.
There was a village near a lake.There lived a young girl. Her name was Atieno.
Atieno's father was a famous fisherman. He had his own little fishing canoe. Atieno enjoyed going fishing with her father.
Atieno loved to watch the boys play football. "Let me play with you," she begged them one day. The boys laughed at her, "Go and play hide and seek with girls. "
Girls said to Atieno, "Your legs are too long." Atieno was sad. Each morning, Atieno danced alone with the sun.The sun became her friend.
One day, the sun did not rise. Cocks did not crow. Birds did not sing. Children did not go to school. Even her father did not go fishing.Atieno was sad. "Where is my friend, the sun? Why is it so dark today?"
Atieno told the other children how sad she was. But they laughed at her, "Perhaps your friend the sun, is dead. Or perhaps it ran away from you."Atieno said, "The sun is my friend. It cannot die."
Atieno was so sad that she ran to the house. She kicked her brother's ball very hard.
Atieno thought, "I will play with this ball until my friend, the sun returns." She picked up the ball and ran out with it.
Atieno put the ball on the ground. She thought, "I can play just like those boys." She kicked the ball hard. It went up and up into the cloudy sky.
Everybody stared up. The ball disappeared into the thick clouds. There was total silence.
Suddenly, the thick clouds cleared. The sun appeared. Life returned to the village once again. Everybody prepared to do what they always did.
Atieno could not believe that the sun was back in the village. But most of all, the sun was back in her life. She told the children, "My friend, the sun is back!"
Once upon a time, the tortoise had no shell.
It was very difficult for her on hot, rainy, and cold days!
She wished she could build herself a house. So, she started collecting materials.
The tortoise moved quite slowly. She was never be able to collect enough tree branches to build a proper house.
She sat down and thought about what to do. After thinking for a long time, she decided to go in search of a house that was already built.
One day, she saw a cave. She peered inside. It looked warm and dry!But the cave belonged to a rabbit and her children.
She climbed up a tree. But, she was chased away by birds chirping and cawing noisily in their nests. The tortoise walked away sadly, sweating in the heat of the sun.
One day, as the tortoise was wandering about, she found a cow in its pen. She was with her calves. "Can I join you, please?" asked Tortoise.“I’m sorry,” said the cow, “but we can’t help you. It's full in here already.”
As the tortoise left the pen, she passed under a tree. Drops of gum from the tree fell on her. The tortoise loved the cool feeling of gum sliding all over her back. Since it was quite hot, she stopped there for a while to rest. Her back got soaked with gum.
As she walked away, she noticed a piece of tree-bark stuck to her back. It was stuck firmly in place.
The tortoise picked up another piece of bark and placed it on her back. Then another piece, and another. She flipped on her back to press them firmly into place.
When she walked in the hot sun, none of the pieces came off.
She jumped into water and splashed around, cool at last.  Best of all, the pieces remained firmly stuck to her back!
Tortoise played in the sand. The pieces of bark remained stuck to her back.
Now the tortoise felt comfortable, no matter what the weather. She was no longer afraid of the heat, rain, or cold. The pieces of bark remained stuck on her back forever.Finally, the tortoise had built her home. She carries it around proudly to this day!
Kadogo and Juma are friends who love running. They run together every day.
One day they were reading maps at school. Juma said, "Let's run across our continent. Let's race, together with Africans from many countries!" "Let's go, we can doit! African unity!" cheered Kadogo.
They decided to carry a unity torch on their journey. They lit the torch and began to run. The race started at the southern tip of our continent, in Cape Town, South Africa.
From South Africa they headed along the west coast. They ran through Namibia, Angola, DRC, Congo and Cameroon. Runners quickly joined them from these countries. The growing group of people rested in Nigeria, in Abuja.
More runners from West Africa joined the friends as they passed through Nigeria.They continued together, following the River Niger.
A sandstorm in Mali made it difficult to run. Juma was the strongest of all of them. He led the way safely, holding the unity torch high.
At Guinea's coast in Conakry the dusty runners washed in the sea. Then they decided to race to Morocco through Senegal and Mauritania. All the way, more people joined them.
At Casablanca, the runners enjoyed playing on the beaches. They made more friends. Next, they set off across North Africa.
They ran through Algeria and Libya, and stopped in Egypt to visit the pyramids. Then they turned and headed east, following the River Nile toEast Africa.
They ran through deserts and national parks. More young people joined them in Kampala, Uganda. The group ran into Kenya, and headed for its coast and the cityof Mombasa.
When they reached the sea, they sat onthe beach and atecoconut rice with fish. Juma said, "Let's take the unity torch to Mount Kilimanjaro, in Tanzania."
But by this time, Juma was very tired. Just as they left Kenya, he fell down. The runners stopped the race. Everyone came tohelp Juma.
Juma passed on the torch to Kadogo. He said, "You can carry the torch to Mount Kilimanjaro. Let'slight a flame for African unity."
After lighting a unity flame high on Kilimanjaro, the group of runners headed into southern Africa. People cheered the runners saying, "You are our heroes.We are together!"
They stopped to swim in Lake Malawi, and rest before going to the next country. Kadogo said to Juma, "We've run from farthest point in southern Africa to the farthest point in North Africa. Now we are in the south again. Our journey is ending."
The unity runners finally carried the torch to Great Zimbabwe, the ancient city of that country. Crowds gathered at this important place, cheering to welcome the tired runners."We did it!" said Kadogo. "What a race!" smiled Juma.
There lived an old man called Hagos. He lived with his three sons.Hagos wanted his sons to have wealth after his death. He prepared three boxes for them.
Hagos went to his neighbour Haile and said, "I want my sons to have wealth. I have prepared three boxes. I want you to give them the boxes after I die."
After Hagos died, Haile called the sons together.He told them, "Your father gave me these boxes before he died. You will each find your name on one of them. Take yours please."
The sons took the boxes and opened them.The first box had gold in it. The second box had soil. The third box had animal dung in it.
The one who found gold was very happy. The other two were not happy. They started quarrelling with him.
"You are brothers, you should not quarrel. Let me take you to a wise old man to advise you," said Haile to the three brothers.
Haile took the brothers to the wise old man. "Good morning, we have come to ask advice about inheritance," said Haile to the old man.
Haile told the wise old man about the three boxes that Hagos had left for his sons."Now they are quarrelling because only one received gold," explained Haile.
The wise old man asserted, "Your father had a reason for giving each of you a particular box."
He continued, "The one who received gold, your father wants you to be a merchant. The one who received soil, your father wants you to be a farmer."
"The one who received animal dung, your father wants you to be a cowboy. Your father wanted you each to have his own profession," the old man concluded.
After they listened to the old man's advice the three brothers agreed. They worked in their professions and lived happily.
Once upon a time, there was a boy called Petros. He was a very clever student. He came first in his class and his parents were proud of him. But Petros wished he had a brother, a sister, or a pet to play with.
One day he asked his mom, "Can I play outside? I have studied all morning and I want to play with my friends now." His mom replied, "All right! Go, but don't be late!"
On the way to the playground, Petros saw something unusual. It was a little dog with white and brown spots. The dog was stuck in a hole and he was scared. "Don't worry, I won't hurt you. I will help you," said Petros.
Petros helped the dog out of the hole. He barked with joy, dancing around the boy and licking him. "You are going to be my dog," said Petros happily as they continued to the playground.
The dog ran far ahead. When Petros' friends saw the dog running towards them, they said, "This dog might be dangerous. It might bite us." They picked up stones and threw them at the little dog. Petros was running and shouting for his friends to stop.
The friends did not hear Petros. The small dog ran as fast as he could to save his life. Then he hid from the boys who were chasing him. They did not find him.
Petros' friends went back to the playground and found Petros crying. "What is wrong?" asked one of them. "You chased my dog!" cried Petros. They were shocked and said, "We didn't know it was your dog. We're sorry. Let's find him."
"It's no use. We will never find my dog," said Petros in a hopeless voice. "Yes, we will find him. Get up Petros, we will find your dog. We must not lose hope," his friends said, consoling him.
Petros and his friends searched for the dog all afternoon until they got tired. Finally, Petros said, "There is one last place where the dog could be. If we don't find him there, I will search no more. Let's go to the river."
When the dog saw the boys coming, he was scared. He tried to cross the river but he was scared of the water. He was about to jump into the river, when he heard Petros calling, "Stop, don't jump!"
The dog turned around, saw Petros and ran to him. Petros hugged the dog and the dog licked Petros's face. "My friend! I thought you were gone forever!" cried Petros.
Back at the playground, Petros gave his friends some advice. "Before you make decisions, think about what could happen as a result. Be careful of hurting others." His friends thought about his words and said, "We are sorry. The dog will be our friend too."
Once upon a time, there lived a man who had plenty of everything – a large fertile farm, with cattle, sheep, and goats. But, as he grew old, he grew sad, because one thing was missing. He did not have a wife.
Standing under a tree one day, he had a brilliant idea.If he couldn't find a wife, perhaps he could make one?
So he set to work to shape a beautiful woman from a strong branch of the tree. When he had finished making the statue, he touched her eyes, and they opened. He blew gently on her, and she came alive.
She was truly the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He knelt before her, and asked her to be his wife.
He gave her a colourful apron, beads, and a head ring, the sign of a married woman. And he built her a house with the mud and grass that used to lie at the foot of her trunk. "Only one thing I beg of you," he said to his wife. "Never tell anyone where you come from."
But before long, the young men from a neighbouring village began talking among themselves. "How can such an old man have such a beautiful young wife?" So they decided to steal her and take her to their own kraal.
The old man was heartbroken. He felt he could not live without her. But then he thought, "Perhaps if I have something of hers, I would not feel so sad?" So he sent his doves to find her, to sing to her, and to bring back something of hers to him.
When they found her, they sang to her in the language of birds. "Tree woman, tree woman. More beautiful than any other. Your husband has sent us. To bring back your apron!"
She gave them her apron, and they flew over the hill, over the river, back to her husband. He held the apron to his face, and was comforted for a little while.
But his longing did not go away. So again he sent his doves to sing to her:Tree woman, tree woman! More beautiful than any otherYour husband has sent us To bring back your head ring! And back they flew with the head ring, the sign of a married woman.
He held the head ring and sighed for his wife, far away in the kraal of other people. He called his doves again. He told them to go to her and sing: Tree woman, tree woman More beautiful than any other Your husband has sent us To bring back your life!
So away they went the third time. They perched on her shoulders. As they sang, each bird pecked out an eye. Immediately she turned again into a statue. Her feet and arms fell away. Then her head. And she fell to the ground.
Her husband slowly rolled her wooden trunk to the river. He stood her up with her roots in the water. Nourished by sun and soil, she grew leaves again.
And when the wind blows, the leaves sigh. Just as a woman does when she longs for her husband.
Many years ago,  the Lizard and the Frog were friends. One day  they decided to look for girlfriends in the city.
The Frog was jealous of  the Lizard's shining and brilliant skin.
He said,  "What did you do to look so beautiful? Look at me,  I am so ugly. What can I do about my skin?"
The Lizard said,  "Listen! Put some water in a pot and put it on the fire. Next you....."
But the Frog said,  "I know already,  I know! Keep quiet,  my friend!" And he left.
Frog arrived home and put some water in a pot.
When the water began to boil,  he threw himself into it.
His skin was burnt and his tail came off!
Instead of being brilliant and beautiful like the Lizard,  he was even more ugly!

One day, mama bought different fruits.
"When can we have some fruit?" we asked. "We will eat the fruit tonight," said mama.
My brother Rahim is greedy. He tasted all the fruit. He ate a lot of it.
"Look at what Rahim did!" shouted my little brother. "Rahim is naughty and selfish," I said.
Mama was angry with Rahim.
We were also angry with Rahim. But Rahim was not sorry.
"Are you going to punish Rahim?" asked little brother.
"Rahim, you will be sorry soon," warned mama.
Rahim started feeling unwell.
"My stomach is painful," whispered Rahim.
Mama knew why Rahim was sick. "The fruit is punishing Rahim," she thought.
Later, Rahim said sorry to us. "I will never be so greedy again," he promised. We believed him.
Every morning when I woke up I hurried to eat my breakfast.
Then I would take my blue blouse and run out of the house to find my friend Muthoni.
Once I found Muthoni,  we would forget everything else.
Muthoni and I would play hide and seek. I hid in big trees,  while Muthoni went behind huts.
We promised each other that we would work hard in school and graduate.
But one day,  Muthoni did not come to school. I stood at the door to our class and waited for her to arrive. But she did not come.
When I returned home that day,  I told my mother about my friend Muthoni.
I continued with school,  but I missed Muthoni very much.
But every day I went to school,  I looked for Muthoni everywhere.
Now I am a lady,  but I still miss my friend Muthoni.
Amara was nine years old. She went to Kerema primary school. Her favorite subjects were English, Science and Social Studies. She wanted to be a lawyer when she grew up. Amara loved animals very much.

Afterwards, Amara's mother apologised for being mean and cruel to Simba. Amara was happy that her mother accepted her dog at last. When Amara is in school her mother feeds Simba. Her mother's friends have learned to be good to their dogs.
Baboon and Crocodile were the best of friends. They played together. They ate together. They did everything together.
But one day,  Crocodile got very sick. He was close to dying. Crocodile went to the nyabezi. "If you want to get better,  you have to eat baboon meat," said the nyabenzi.
When he heard this, Crocodile cried. If he wanted to get better, he had no choice than to eat his friend the baboon.
When Baboon went to see his friend, he got on Crocodile's back. Crocodile took Baboon out to the deepest part of the river.
"What is troubling you, my friend?" asked Baboon.Crocodile said, "The nyabezi told me that if I want to get better I must eat you, my friend."
Baboon replied,  "No, don't eat me. I'm too small!Wait a minute and I'll call my grandfather. He's bigger than me. Eat him and you'll be full."
Crocodile said,  "Where is this grandfather of yours?"Baboon replied,  "He's in the tree on that island." Crocodile said,  "Go and get him so that I may eat him."
Baboon jumped off Crocodile's back and ran straight up the tree. Crocodile waited and waited. But Baboon did not return. And that was the end of their friendship.
Don was a big baboon. He was a bully.
He was the baboon chief.
His followers gave him a special cloth.
“I will wear this on my head,” said Don.
“Everyone follow my orders. Do not question me!” shouted Don.
So, the followers followed their chief. If Don jumped, everyone jumped.
But the band on Don's head was too tight.
He touched his sore head. The baboons all touched their heads.
“This hurts,” said Don.“This hurts,” they copied.
“This is too tight!” “This is too tight,” they copied.
Don fell down, over a cliff. They all copied him.
The baboon chief died. His followers were hurt, but they lived.
The wind roars. It roars past our home.
The wind is powerful. It tears my kite from my hand.
I run after my kite. The wind blows me away from the kite!
The wind becomes a storm. It carries my kite higher and higher.
The tornado swallows me up! I see nothing, I touch nothing.
Where is my kite now? Perhaps it is caught in a tree.
Perhaps my kite is still flying in the sky.
The wind finally dies down. I am still spinning.
When I stop spinning I look around. Where did the wind go?
I cannot see my kite anywhere. I cannot hear the wind anymore.
Perhaps tomorrow I will find my kite.
Now, I must go home, before the wind starts to roar again.
In a village, there was a young boy whose name was Abula. He did not like to read or even to open a book. He was a lazy pupil. He behaved badly.
Abula stole his mother's money to buy sweets. Even when she hid her money, he found it and took it. After eating all his sweets, Abula would play with his friends.
After a while, Abula stopped going to school. He stayed out playing the whole day, only returning home in the evening. Abula's mother noticed this and became worried.
“Our son is not behaving well. I do not think he is attending school. He is also stealing money from me,” said Abula's mother. His father thought about how best to change Abula's behaviour.
He said to his wife, “Next time, hide the money within the pages of a book. He never even opens a book, so the money will be safe there.”
The next day, Abula looked for his mother's money. He searched everywhere but he did not find anything. He decided to go to the nearest market to find some money.
His father saw where Abula was going. “My son, I know why you are going to the market. Now go back inside and look in the books for money,” he said.
Abula was puzzled, but he went and searched in the books. He found the money that his mother had hidden.
The next day, he looked in the books again. But there was nothing hidden there. He went to his father to ask why there was no money in the books.
His father smiled and replied, “My son, do you want to get enough money to buy many sweets?” Abula answered, “Of course, father.”
His father said, “Listen to me carefully. Read your books and attend your classes. You will find rewards in books. Do not give up.” “But father, reading is a difficult activity. Books are boring!” Abula replied.
For a while, Abula's father was quiet. He thought about how to encourage his son. Then he said to Abula, “Let us read together. I will help you to find the wealth in books.”
Long time ago, in the village of Elunyiko, there lived a man called Ndonga and his wife called Namukhaywa. They had six children. All of them were girls.
When Namukhaywa was pregnant with her seventh child, Ndonga warned her, "If you give birth to another girl, I will leave you. But if you give me a baby boy, I will hold a big party for you!"
When it was time to give birth, Namukhaywa went to the traditional midwife. Would the child be a girl or a boy?
It was a boy AND a girl – twins! She called the boy Mukhwana, and the girl she called Mulongo. As she looked at Mukhwana, she was very happy. But as she looked at Mulongo, she felt sad. She felt that there was only one thing she could do.
Namukhaywa left Mulongo in the care of the midwife and took Mukhwana home to her husband.
She proudly showed Ndonga the baby boy. He was very happy and called all the villagers to celebrate the birth of his son.
Mukhwana grew up to be a fine young man. And Mulongo grew up to be a fine young woman.
One day, while minding his father's cattle, Mukhwana saw a very beautiful girl. "This is the girl I want to marry," he said to himself.
But when he asked her to marry him, she sang this song: Mukhwana wefwe, Mukhwana. So yakhupa omunwa, Mukhwana. Nebebula omukhana, Mukhwana. Barulaka khulwanda, Mukhwana. Nebebula omusiani, Mukhwana. Barera mungo muno, Mukhwana. Iyeyi yakwa, Mukhwana. Iyindi yakwa, Mukhwana.
This happened again and again. Mukhwana did not know what to do. He went to his mother, Namukhaywa. "I have found a beautiful girl," he said. "And I want to marry her. But every time I ask her, she sings the same song."
To his surprise, Namukhaywa said, "What the girl is singing about is true. That is your sister. You were born twins. Your father wanted a son, not a daughter. So I left your baby sister with the midwife, and brought you home to your father."
When Mukhwana told his father the story, he saw that he had been wrong. He called Namukhaywa and together they went to the midwife to fetch Mulongo.
When Mulongo arrived home, her father and the village elders slaughtered a goat and performed the traditional ceremony for re-uniting Mulongo and her seven siblings.
A year later, Mulongo was married to the son of the rich king of that village. She brought a lot of wealth and happiness to her family.
Once upon a time, there was a goat called Igodhoobe*. Igodhoobe the goat was the king of farm animals and birds. He lived a good life. One day, Igodhoobe the goat called all the animals and birds to a meeting.*pronounced ee-god-who-buhe
"My friends, I have called you because I had a dream," said the goat. All the animals and birds kept quiet. They listened to their king carefully.
"I dreamed that there was no food or water left in the land. Many of our relatives died!" said the king. When the animals and the birds heard the dream, they were worried. "What shall we do?" asked the cat.
The hen and the duck had an idea. They said, "Let each one of us bring food and put it in the king's store." All the animals agreed with this idea.
The king made a rule. He said, "Get ropes. Tie up anyone who does not bring food to my store. Then carry him to me."
But, soon after this, it was time for a new king to rule over the farm. All the animals and birds met and elected the cat as their new king.
But the goat refused to agree that the cat was king. "I'm the king. There is no other king. I can't obey any other animal," said the goat.
The animals took food to the new king's store. But the goat did not take anything. "When the goat was king, we all obeyed him. Now he does not want to obey our new king. What shall we do?" asked the cow.
All the domestic animals and birds were angry. "He thinks he is different to us," they all muttered.
The dog said, "I helped him when he was king. I did not sleep at night. I was always with him, ready to help."
The sheep said, "I gave him my wool to cover his children."
The pig said, "When he was king, he told his friends that I eat a lot. But I was often in his garden digging and weeding his maize and millet."
The sheep asked, "What did he say? That you eat a lot? Did he think that he will be king forever?" Then the sheep added, "Let him understand that he is not king any more. I don't know why he thinks he is so important."
All the animals laughed and agreed that the goat must take food to the new king. King Cat ordered the goat to come to him.
When the animals went to fetch the goat, he was sitting on a chair with his legs crossed. "I shall not go to the cat. There is no other king except me. When you become a king, you are always a king," said the goat.
"We will tie you with ropes and take you to the new king," said the sheep.
So the cow tied the goat to her tail. She then pulled him to the king. The sheep, the duck, the dog, the pig, and the cock cheered as the cow pulled the goat. They all shouted, "Take this stubborn goat to our new king!"
From that time, every goat refuses to move when it is pulled. It thinks that you are taking it to the king's court.
Have you ever seen a herd of cows in the field? Every now and then you will notice a cow shaking her head. She tries to drive away the flies that pester her. But why do the flies zoom-zoom­zee around Cow's head?
They say it started long, long ago in a far-off country. The country's queen was very rich and had a kind heart. One day she decided to arrange a huge banquet. All the animals were invited. The enormous tables were beautifully laden. Every table groaned under the delicacies, dishes full of meat, freshly baked bread, steaming vegetables and honey-sweet fruit.
The animals smacked their lips when they saw the delicious food. “The largest animal at each table should sit at the head,” the queen said. “It is his or her job to dish out the food.” Cow shared a table with Sheep, Goat, Dog, Goose and Fly. Since Cow was the biggest, she started dishing out the food. Each animal received a big chunk of home-baked bread with grape jam and cheese.
But because Fly was so small, Cow hardly noticed her. “Zoom! Zoom! Zee! What about me? I'd also like something to eat, you see?” Fly grumbled. But Cow pretended not to hear Fly. She tucked into the delicious bread. Poor Fly sat there deprived of everything, watching the other animals eat.
When they had finished the last crumb of bread, Cow started dishing out the meat and vegetables. Each animal received a large plate of food. But because Fly was so small, Cow once again hardly noticed her. “Zoom! Zoom! Zee! What about me? I'd also like something to eat, you see?” Fly grumbled louder than before. Cow rolled her eyes and was annoyed with Fly.
“Hey! Where are your manners?” Cow said. “A bug like you doesn't even belong at the queen's banquet. You can wait until the bigger animals have finished.” The food was finished in two ticks. Poor Fly didn't receive the tiniest morsel. Cow started sharing the fruit. There were delicious water melon, juicy spanspek and red-cheeked apples.
All the animals received food, but Fly had to go without it. “Zoom! Zoom! Zee! What about me? I'd also like something to eat, you see?” Fly complained. Cow laughed and took a bite from her apple. “Do you hear something?” she asked the other animals at the table. “I don't hear anything.” In a jiffy all the food at the table had been finished. The animals were overstuffed. Everyone except Fly. Her tummy growled with hunger.
After the meal it was time to dance and be merry. But Fly was angry. She decided to go home. The queen noticed Fly. “Why are you leaving, Fly?” the queen asked. “Don't you enjoy my banquet?” Fly curtsied before the queen. “I'm sorry, your Majesty,” she said. “I'm sure the food was delicious. But I didn't have a tiny morsel of food.” And she told the queen what had happened. The queen was very angry when she heard what Cow had done.
“From now on you and your friends may pester Cow every day,” the queen said. “From morning till night you may buzz around her ears. It will teach her a lesson. She will never be able to ignore you again. And she'll see that even the tiniest insect is important to me.”
And that is exactly what Fly has been doing until today. She and her friends buzz around Cow's ears from morning till night. And while they are doing it, they sing: “Zoom! Zoom! Zee! Never ever again, Can you ignore us. Say amen!”

In the olden days, Thunder and Lightning lived on earth amongst people.
Thunder was the mother of Lightning.
Lightning was hot tempered and he often got into arguments.
Whenever Lightning was angry he used to go around burning houses and knocking down trees.He made a frightening noise, "Pia-la-la-la, pia-la-la-la!" He damaged farms, and even sometimes killed people.
Whenever Lightning did these things, his mother would call out to him in a very loud voice, "Bumrambo- la-la-la, la-bum!" She tried to make him stop causing damage.
But Lightning did not care about what his mother said.He would cause problems for everyone when he was in a bad temper.
At last, people complained to the king.
So the king ordered that Thunder and her son should leave the village.He sent them to live far away from people's houses.
This did not do much good. When Lightning was angry he still burnt forests, "Pia-la-la-la, pia-la-la-la!" The flames sometimes spread to farms and burned them.
So people complained to the king again.
This time, the king told Lightning and Thunder that they could nolonger live on earth.He sent them to live in the sky, where they could not cause as much damage.
Ever since then, when Lightning is angry, he still manages to burn and destroy, "Pia-la-la-la, pia-lala- la!" And we still hear his mother, Thunder, scolding him, "Bumrambo- la-la-la, la-bum!"

King Leopard was getting old. How will he choose the next king?
King Leopard called animals to the party. He would announce his plan.
After the party, King Leopard spoke. The animals listened.
He said, “A contest will decided the next king.”
One who counts to ten before the spear falls, will be king.
Elephant pushed everyone aside, “I’m the biggest. I should be king.”
Elephant only counted up to four. The spear fell.
Boar pushed everyone saying, “I’m the strongest. I should be king.”
Boar counted up to six and the spear fell. He left.
Everyone said, “Big Elephant and strong Boar failed. Who can win?”
Ape counted, “One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven!” He cried.
King Leopard said, “Ape, you only get one chance.” Ape left.
Some animals started leaving. Then, Little Antelope said, “Let me try.”
King Leopard shouted, “Give Antelope a chance. Let her try.”
Antelope said, “Five and five is ten.”The spear fell down.
The contest showed the smartest animal. Antelope was queen after leopard.
Once upon a time, there was a hardworking farmer. He had a hardworking wife, and two sons
He had enough food because he and his wife worked very hard. He wanted his children to have a good life. He never let them do any work.
After some time, his wife died.
The man still did not want his children to work. He did the field labour and all the housework too.
But as time went on, the man became old and sick. He started to worry about what would become of his children when he died. They would not be able to take care of themselves.
He called his sons. He said, "My inheritance to you is a lot of gold hidden in the fields. So, it's up to you to plough them and find the gold."
He also called his neighbours and said, "I'm going to die soon. My sons do not know how to look after themselves. Please look after them until they can do it for themselves."
After the man died, the neighbours provided his sons with food for some time.
The brothers did not want to be robbed of the gold their father buried. They decided to do the digging themselves.
They dug one field after another, but they did not find any gold.
They sat down and one asked the other, "Do you think our father cheated us?" The other brother said, "No, I think our father was saying that farming is gold. And if we dig the fields, plant, and plough we can become rich."
So, like all the other farmers, they dug up the fields. They grew wheat and became very rich
In a village on the slopes of Mount Kenya in East Africa,  a little girl worked in the fields with her mother. Her name was Wangari.
Wangari loved being outside. In her family's food garden she broke up the soil with her machete. She pressed tiny seeds into the warm earth.
Her favourite time of day was just after sunset. When it got too dark to see the plants,  Wangari knew it was time to go home. She would follow the narrow paths through the fields,  crossing rivers as she went.
Wangari was a clever child and couldn't wait to go to school. But her mother and father wanted her to stay and help them at home. When she was seven years old,  her big brother persuaded her parents to let her go to school.
She liked to learn! Wangari learnt more and more with every book she read. She did so well at school that she was invited to study in the United States of America. Wangari was excited! She wanted to know more about the world.
At the American university Wangari learnt many new things. She studied plants and how they grow. And she remembered how she grew: playing games with her brothers in the shade of the trees in the beautiful Kenyan forests.
The more she learnt,  the more she realised that she loved the people of Kenya. She wanted them to be happy and free. The more she learnt,  the more she remembered her African home.
When she had finished her studies,  she returned to Kenya. But her country had changed. Huge farms stretched across the land. Women had no wood to make cooking fires. The people were poor and the children were hungry.
Wangari knew what to do. She taught the women how to plant trees from seeds. The women sold the trees and used the money to look after their families. The women were very happy. Wangari had helped them to feel powerful and strong.
As time passed,  the new trees grew into forests,  and the rivers started flowing again. Wangari's message spread across Africa. Today,  millions of trees have grown from Wangari's seeds.
Wangari had worked hard. People all over the world took notice,  and gave her a famous prize. It is called the Nobel Peace Prize,  and she was the first African woman ever to receive it.
Wangari died in 2011,  but we can think of her every time we see a beautiful tree.
It is nearly break time at Siyafunda Primary School. The two spaza shop owners at the school are preparing lunch to sell to hungry children.
In Mr Motaung’s shop, the bread is cut and ready for making kotas. He carefully cuts out the soft middle of each quarter loaf. Then he puts polony and chips in the space inside. Motaung puts two spoonfuls of his wife’s homemade atchar in each kota. He likes to boast that his kotas have atchar inside and atchar on top!
In Mr Mkhize’s shop, the chips are nearly ready, but he is still cutting his bread for kotas. He is worried because things are not going well with his shop. “It started well,” thinks Mkhize. “But now I get fewer and fewer customers. At least I’m reducing some of my costs by cutting five kotas from a loaf.”
Jabu and Zodwa are buying lunch. Zodwa buys from Mr Mkhize. Jabu buys from Mr Motaung. He believes that Motaung’s kota has got more chips and atchar than Mkhize’s kota.
The queue at Mr Motaung’s shop is always longer. Zodwa waits for Jabu. Then the friends sit together in the shade to enjoy their kotas.
Zodwa notices something that makes her stare and frown. “What are you staring at?” asks Jabu. “Your kota! It looks bigger than mine,” says Zodwa.
They both look very closely at their kotas. Sure enough, Jabu’s is bigger. “Something is not right here,” says Zodwa. “I wonder if this is the reason Mr Mkhize’s shop is not busy anymore.” Jabu thinks for a while and then he replies, “Well, I heard that some kids saw Mkhize cutting his bread into five pieces for kotas!”
Nomsa overhears Jabu and Zodwa talking and she’s curious. She asks them what’s wrong with cutting the loaf into five pieces for kotas. Zodwa and Jabu reply together, “A kota is a quarter of a loaf!” Nomsa still looks confused, so Zodwa explains, “The loaf must be cut into four equal pieces. Otherwise, they are not quarters.”
Nomsa is cross because she also buys from Mr Mkhize. “So, he is stealing bread from us!” she says in a loud voice. Zodwa decides to go back to Mkhize’s shop to complain. She marches off, holding her kota up in the air. Nomsa hurries behind her. Jabu sighs and gets up to follow his friends.
Mr Mkhize is disappointed when he sees that the children aren’t new customers. “Oh, hello again kids,” he mutters, “how can I help you?” “Mr Mkhize, I asked you for a quarter and I paid you for a quarter. But this is not a quarter,” says Zodwa, pointing at her kota. “I want a quarter kota or my money back,” she adds firmly.
“Is it true Mr Mkhize? You’ve been cheating us!” cries Nomsa. A few children have followed them to the shop and are now listening to the fierce accusations. Mkhize waves his hands wildly. “What are you saying about me?” he protests. “I’m not like that! I want you to get out of my shop now!”
Then Zodwa says quietly, “We will tell everyone what you are doing. It will spread like wildfire throughout the school. You will have to close your shop. No one will come and buy from you!” Mr Mkhize looks at the three children standing in front of him. Then he looks at the growing crowd outside his shop.
“OK,” he says eventually, “I will give you your money back. “And also promise that you will cut each loaf into quarters for your kotas,” speaks up Jabu. Mr Mkhize promises that he will. Then he clears his throat and says loud enough for everyone to hear, “I also promise that I will add more atchar and more chips to my kotas.”
Mr Mkhize did indeed add extra chips and atchaar to his kotas. Soon more children were buying from him, and his shop started doing well. He was even able to hire someone to help him.
Now there is a healthy competition between Mr Mkhize and Mr Motaung, and everyone is happy.
This story is about me, and an Old Age Home.
It is a big building in Bertrams, Johannesburg.The walls are colourful, and it is clean and quiet inside. The people that live there are very old. My mother took us there one day.
This Old Age Home is my happy place! I become happy whenever I see old people and can help them.
One day I went there and I washed some of the old people's hair.
I also served them food.Some of the old people were scary, but it still made me happy to be there.
There was this old angry lady who didn't want anybody to help her. She would start shouting.
There was another old lady, I held her hands and she didn't want to let go. Her hands were soft and warm. She had the same name as my sister, Aisha.
Old people make me happy. They have stories of past times which I will never know.
A long time ago, in the village of Mkosi, there lived a greedy hyena.
In a nearby village, lived a timid tortoise. The hyena and the tortoise were friends.
Hyena heard that across the great western river lived bees that made delicious honey. These bees traveled once a year, and were away from their hives for a whole week. “We must get that honey while the bees are away,” said Hyena to Tortoise.
The tortoise was afraid to go. But he was too timid to refuse. The next morning, the two animals set off for the beehives. The hyena walked very fast but the tortoise dragged behind in fear.
They went up a hill, down into a valley and across the plains. Then they crossed the great western river, and walked further.
Finally, they saw beehives in trees on a hill. The hyena ran to the trees energetically. The tortoise almost fainted because he was so tired and hungry.
When Hyena reached the biggest beehive, he wasted no time. He called to Tortoise, “Quickly, climb up the tree and knock down the hive.”
The tortoise struggled slowly up the tree. He knew he could easily slip and fall. This annoyed the hyena, who started yelling at Tortoise.
When Tortoise touched the beehive, he heard the buzzing of bees. They were still in their hives! The tortoise was startled and fell out of the tree. The big beehive fell too.
The beehive landed on the tortoise. Honey covered him completely so he was hidden! Hyena started to lick up the honey. The bees were not pleased.
The bees stung the hyena on every part of his body. Hyena decided to run for his life but the bees followed him.
The hyena ran down the hill, through the river, across the plains and into the valley. The bees swarmed around him all the way, stinging him.
The tortoise, still under the big beehive, noticed that everything was quiet. The beehive and honey had dried on his back.
Soon the tortoise realised that he no longer needed to crawl into a bush to hide. His hard new shell of honey could protect him.
The hyena was so tired and full of stings that he fainted before he got home. When he woke up, he discovered that the stings had caused patches in his fur.
This is how the tortoise got his hard shell, and the hyena got his patches. Hyena swore that he would never again steal. But the hyena and the tortoise are no longer friends.

Blue skies and calm waters — a perfect day for diving! We setout in a little boat, hoping for a BIG adventure!
When we reached the dive site, we carefully checked all ourequipment and put on our fins and masks.
As soon as we were underwater, we were greeted by a school ofyellowback fusiliers.
There were so many different creatures to see around this large table coral:  oriental sweetlips, parrotfish, batfish, and even abeautifully-patterned nudibranch.				To know more about the creatures marked out in bold lettering, turn to the back section of this book.
This trumpetfish changed colour to try and blend in with a schoolof yellow tang, but you can pick him out easily enough, can’t you?
It’s a good thing we kept a safe distance from this lionfish.The spines on his back can be quite poisonous!
These clownfish carefully guarded their sea anemone home, butfinally agreed to let me take a few pictures.
We saw a honeycomb moray eel having its teeth cleaned by cleanerwrasses, and another pair even offered to give us a scrub!
There were triggerfish and sea urchins. We even saw a coral grouper and a reef octopus playinghide-and-seek.
The octopus won the game. They’re masters of disguise. Pipefish are great at disguise too. Can you spot the two ghostpipefish in this picture?
We came across a couple of whitetip reef sharks resting near thebottom. They’re pretty harmless, so we swam in for a closer look.
We followed this hawksbill turtle for a while as he looked aroundthe reef for a nice sea sponge to lunch on.
As we made our way back to the boat, we were thrilled to see amanta ray ‘flying’ through the water with two remora fish in tow.
And just when we thought this dive couldn’t possibly get anybetter, we sighted a dugong grazing on some sea grass.
What an incredible experience! I can’t wait to go diving again!
Corals are both plants andanimals. Thousands of little algae live inside corals, and give themenergy to grow. They have hard outer skeletons and grow into manydifferent shapes.Plankton is the main source of food for many sea creatures. Theyare a mix of algae, bacteria, tiny animals, and the eggs and larvaeof larger animals that float about with the ocean currents.Feather stars may look like plants, but they’re really animals.They use their feather-like ‘arms’ to catch and eat bits offloating plankton.
Parrotfish have strong teeth that form a parrot-like beak, whichthey use to scrape algae off hard coral. Some species don’t mindeating bits of coral as well, and they later poop out a fine sandthat washes up on land to form beautiful white beaches. Clownfish and sea anemones live together and help each other. The clownfish help the anemones by cleaning their tentacles and luringother fish for the anemone to eat. The anemones, in turn, allow theclownfish to hide among their poisonous tentacles without stingingthem. Cleaner wrasses are small fish that keep bigger fish clean byfeeding on their parasites and dead skin. The bigger fish recognisethe wrasses by their colours and the dance-like way they move.
The reef octopus can hide by changing its colour and texture. Itmakes its home in holes in the reef, or buries  itself in the sand.Ghost pipefish can be found in pairs, floating with their headsdown and hidden among sea grass, corals or feather stars. Like thereef octopus, they can change colour to blend in perfectly.The whitetip reef shark has a thin body, broad head, and whitetips on its dorsal and tail fin. They hunt at night, and sleepthrough most of the day.
The hawksbill turtle has a flat body, a shell with jagged edges,and a sharp, curving mouth that looks like a hawk’s beak. Manta rays are huge fish with wing-like fins on the sides of theirbodies. These large fins help them swim gracefully through the water.On some manta rays, the distance from one wing tip to the other canreach up to 23 feet! The dugong is a vegetarian marine mammal. Its favourite food issea grass, which it is able to graze on with its  specially-shapedsnout. Dugongs are also called sea cows.
Mother and father left their baby with their older children.
The older children played and forgot about the baby.
One day, cranes came across the crying baby.
They lifted the baby in its blanket and flew away.
The mother saw four cranes flying away with her baby.
The cranes looked after the baby.
While the cranes were away, a frog swallowed the baby!
For three flies, the frog returned the baby to its parents.
Long ago, Thunder and Lightning lived on earth among people.
Thunder was the mother of Lightning.
Lightning had a bad temper.
When Lightning was angry, he destroyed people, houses and trees.
When Lightning caused such damage, Thunder made a loud noise.
Lightning did not pay attention to his mother.
At last,  people complained to the king.
The king sent Thunder and Lightning to live far away.
Lightning still burnt forests and crops when he was angry.
So people complained to the king again.
The king sent Thunder and Lightning to live in the sky.
But Lightning still burns and destroys when he is angry.
My village had many problems. We made a long line to fetch water from one tap.
We waited for food donated by others.
We locked our houses early because of thieves.
Many children dropped out of school.
Young girls worked as maids in other villages.
Young boys roamed around the village while others worked on people's farms.
When the wind blew,  waste paper hung on trees and fences.
People were cut by broken glass that was thrown carelessly.
Then one day,  the tap dried up and our containers were empty.
My father walked from house to house asking people to attend a village meeting.
People gathered under a big tree and listened.
My father stood up and said,  "We need to work together to solve our problems."
Eight-year-old Aminu,  sitting on a tree trunk shouted,  "I can help with cleaning up."
One woman said,  "The women can join me to grow food."
Another man stood up and said,  "The men will dig a well."
We all shouted with one voice,  "We must change our lives." From that day we worked together to solve our problems.
Musa lives with his parents in the village of Kagadama, in Nigeria. He is an intelligent boy, but he is stubborn.
Musa is also a bully. He always beats his friends. Whenever he comes across animals he also beats them.
One day on his way back from school, he sees a cat. He picks up the cat and goes home with it.
When his father sees him, he says "Musa stop abusing that cat! Take it back to where you found it."
Musa refuses to return the cat and locks it in a cage.
As he is sleeping in his room that night, Musa has a dream. Musa sees the cat growing bigger and running towards him. Its mouth is open, with sharp teeth. It wants to eat him!
The cat starts to swallow his feet. It eats half way up to Musa's knees. Then he wakes up.
The next day Musa returns the cat to where he found it. From then, he promises to be a good boy.
Once upon a time,  there was a man who had three sons. The youngest son was the cleverest and his father liked him the most. Then the man realised that his two other sons were jealous. So when the father died,  he left all his cattle to his two elder sons. He only left one ox for the youngest son. But the brothers were still jealous of him.
One day they said,  "We've got to slaughter your ox." He was the youngest so he couldn't protest. He said,  "If that must be so,  there's nothing I can do. But please give me the hide." When they slaughtered the ox,  he took the hide. After drying it,  he climbed a tree with it.
As it got darker,  a group of merchants came to sleep under the tree. In the middle of the night,  the young man started beating the hide with a stick. When the stick hit the hide it sounded like thunder. The merchants thought that a storm was coming. They ran off leaving their goods behind.
The young man picked up the goods and took them home to his brothers. They asked,  "Where did you get all these things?"  He said,  "The price of hides is so expensive that I got all this for my one hide."
The brothers quickly slaughtered their cattle. They went to the market and called,  "Hides for sale! Hides for sale!"  The people at the market said,  "We don't want your hides!" They were very angry and said to their brother,  "You fooled us,  so as a punishment,  we're going to burn your hut."
The smart brother said,  "There's nothing I can do,  but please give me the ashes." They burnt his hut. He took the ashes in a bag and went away to a rich man's hut. The rich man gave him permission to sleep in his hut. When he was going to eat,  he said to the rich man,  "Look after this bag,  it has got a lot of valuables."
In the morning he started shouting. The rich man went to ask him what was wrong. "Someone has taken all my valuables and replaced them with ashes!" moaned the young man. The rich man didn't want his reputation to be ruined. So he said,  "I'll fill it up with anything you want." He filled it with wheat,  teff and all sorts of seeds.
The brother went home and said,  "Look,  ashes have become very expensive. See what I managed to buy from selling those ashes." The brothers went and burnt their huts as well. They took the ashes to the market and shouted,  "Ashes for sale! Ashes for sale!"  Everybody said,  "How stupid you are,  who'll buy ashes?"
The brothers were very angry and decided to kill their younger brother. They tied him up and put him in a basket so that they could throw him over a cliff. While they were carrying the basket to the cliff,  they met an old man. He said to them,  "My cattle have run away,  will you bring them back for me?" The brothers put down the basket and ran off.
The young man called from inside the basket to the old man. He asked,  "What's wrong with you?" The young man replied,  "They want me to become a king but I don't want to be one." The old man said,  "If I get into the basket will I become king?" And the young man answered,  "Yes."
The old man let the young man out of the basket and he got inside. After the brothers returned with the cattle,  they picked up the basket and threw it over the cliff. The young brother took the old man's cattle back to his hut. His brothers were amazed that he was still alive,  but all they said was,  "Where did you get these cattle?"
He said,  "There are many cattle at the bottom of the cliffs. If you jump off the cliffs in baskets,  you will find some too." The older brothers got into baskets. The clever brother threw the baskets over the cliffs. He lived happily ever after.
Ayanda decided to run away from home.She went to the forest because she did not know where else to go.
A wolf in the forest chased Ayanda, so she climbed a tree.The wolf tried to bite her, so she climbed higher.
At the top of the tree, Ayanda saw the beautiful sun.She fell in love with the sun, and decided to stay in the forest.
Ayanda climbed the tree every day to talk to the sun.The sun became her family.
One day, Ayanda saw a man under the tree.The man was her father. Ayanda came down from the tree and her father explained why he was there.
He said, "Long before you were born, your mother and I would meet here. It is a special place.""Now I climb this tree to get peace when your mother and I fight," said Ayanda's father.
After a while, Ayanda's mother also came to the forest.She came to make peace with Ayanda's father. This was their peace tree.
Long ago, there was a foolish lazy jackal. He lived with his old father in the Kalahari bush.
One morning Old Jackal woke up to find his son sleeping in the sun. The food was not ready and the goats were still in the kraal! "Young man, you are so lazy! Go and find a wife. I am too old to look after you," said Jackal's father. So Jackal jumped up and took the goats out to graze.
In the bush, he saw something shining on a rock. He went closer and closer to the rock. The closer he got, the more beautiful the shine was. Perhaps this was the wife for him!
"You are beautiful," said Jackal to the shine. "But who are you? Why are you alone?" "I am the sun," the shine answered. "My family left me here when they moved on. They did not want to carry me. I am too hot."
The jackal said, "But you are so beautiful! I will carry you. I will take you home to meet my father." "All right, you can carry me. But do not complain when I get too hot for you," said the sun.
So Jackal put the sun on his back and started the journey home. Before long, the sun was burning Jackal's fur. "Will you please come down from my back? I need to rest," said Jackal. His back was so sore that he could hardly walk. "Just carry on!" said the sun. "I told you not to complain!"
Then Jackal saw a log across the path. He crawled under the log so that the sun would fall off.
But the log also scraped the skin and fur from his back and they were left behind with the sun.
The new fur was a different colour to the fur on the rest of his body. The different colours always reminded Jackal not to be so foolish again.
Long ago Hen and Eagle were friends. One day,  Eagle found Hen under a tree resting with her hopping bags. Hen was standing on one leg.
Eagle asked Hen,  "Where is your other leg?"
Hen told Eagle,  "The shopkeeper cut off my leg and gave me these groceries in return."
Eagle asked Hen whether he could do the same. He also wanted a bag of groceries. Hen agreed.
Eagle went to the shopkeeper and asked her to cut off one of his legs in exchange for groceries. The shopkeeper accepted.
The eagle hopped on one leg all the way home. But he was happy with the things the shopkeeper gave him.
When Eagle reached home,  he found Hen with both her legs.
Eagle was furious and chased Hen. But he never caught her. Instead,  Eagle always looks out for Hen's children. Whenever he catches one,  he eats it.
Hello! My name is Nanu. I am waiting with my mother for a taxi. We are going home.
Here I am standing in line. My mother sings me a song. "Come Mr Taxi can't you see? We are waiting,  Nanu and me!"
The lady next to me is taking her chickens home. They will lay eggs for her to eat.
These men are coming back from work. They smile at me. I hear them sing,  "Hey little Nanu,  don't you worry. Taxi's coming in a hurry."
A lady walks past. She is a very smart lady. Aren't her shoes beautiful? They go "click,  click,  clickclick,  click,  click" when she walks.

This lady has beautiful earrings. I think she bought them in town today. When I grow up I will buy many earrings for me and my mother.
My mother is getting tired now. I sing her a song,  "Please Mr Taxi,  won't you come,  we are waiting,  me and mum."
Wait! I can hear the taxi! Here it comes!
This is our big red taxi. It has come to take me and my mother home. I am very happy!
Goodbye!
There was a man who had two wives. The wives gave birth to two daughters, Adie and Adhoch. The step sisters loved each other very much.
Adie was hard working, neat, kind and well behaved. Adhoch, on the other hand, was lazy, unkind and untidy.
Teachers loved Adie. She got many presents for her hard work. Adhoch did not receive any. Her mother was jealous of Adie.
Adie's mother became sick and died. Adie's stepmother did not love her as her mother did.
Adhoch's mother made Adie do all the work. She did not have time to get ready for school. Adhoch studied and played when Adie was busy working.
Adie still did well in school. She passed her exams and received more presents. This made Adhoch's mother very angry.
One day, Adhoch's mother asked Adie to go with her to the river to fetch water. When they got there, she told Adie to go deeper into the river to fetch clean water. Adie was swept to the opposite side of the river.
Mother went back home. Adhoch asked where her sister was. Her mother said, "Adie is at the river with her friends. She will come home later."
When night fell, Adhoch went to look for her step sister at the river. She called her name, "Adie! Where are you?" Adhoch heard, "I am on the other side of the river. Mother abandoned me."
Adhoch walked across the river calling her sister. "Adie! Where are you?" She heard the same reply, "I am on the other side of the river. Mother abandoned me."
Adhoch got deep into the river. She was swept across to the other side in the same way as Adie.
Adhoch's mother was sad. She lost Adhoch because she was jealous of Adie. She had to do all the work by herself.
One million years ago, a soccer gem was formed.When it was discovered, people fought to possess this powerful jewel.
During the first soccer world war the gem was lost. No one knew what happened to it.Many years passed. The soccer gem would only be found when the greatest soccer star was born.
Not long ago, there was a boy named David. He was from a poor family.
Before David's father died, he gave the soccer gem to his son.At first, the boy didn't know the power of the jewel.
He was a teenager when he first used the gem to play soccer.David hadn't gone to school. But with the gem's power, he won every single match he played with his friends.
He realised that he could make money for his family from playing soccer. He would open a shop for his mother, and send his brother and sisters to school.
David became the best professional soccer player that anyone had seen.It was even said that he was from another world!
The soccer star who will never be forgotten!

Soon granny came back from her walk."Look what I found in the park."
"It can sway, it can bounce.It can spin, it can dangle.Ha-ha, hee-hee," said Granny with a giggle.
Oh Granny! Thank you so much!You have found my dear yo-yo!
"Yo-yo? What a funny name!What a funny toy!I want to play with it,It gives me so much joy!"
Giggle, giggle, giggling away,Granny played, with my little toy.For the rest of the day!
They closed the schools, and sent us home.
We cannot play with other children.
I miss being with my friends.
I miss going to school.
Mother is worried about Uncle.He is sick in hospital.

Ostrich and Lioness were great friends. Both of them had young ones.
Unlike the Lioness, the Ostrich fed her chicks well.
The Lioness' cubs had little food to eat.
The Lioness looked at the Ostrich's chicks and thought, “They are beautiful! I wish they were mine.”
One day, when the Ostrich was away, the Lioness took the chicks away to her home.
The Ostrich returned and found the cubs in her home instead.  “Where are my children?” she cried.
The Ostrich ran to the Lioness' hut and saw her chicks with Lioness.
The Lioness refused to let the Ostrich take her chicks. She said, “They are mine now. You can have the cubs.”
The Ostrich was angry and upset. “What can I do to get back my children?” she wondered to herself.
Then she thought, “I know what to do. I will call all the animals for a meeting.”
The animals gathered together.
Elephant asked the Ostrich and Lioness to speak.
Most of the animals were afraid to blame the Lioness.
Finally, Squirrel stood up and said, “Children that look like birds, belong to the Ostrich. Those with tails, belong to the Lioness.”
Then Squirrel disappeared into a hole. All the animals cheered.
Lioness was very annoyed. She went home with her cubs.
Once upon a time in a big palace, there lived a king and his beautiful daughter, the princess.
Elephant lived in a house on one side of the palace. Chameleon lived on the other side.
At this time, there was a terrible drought across the land. The king had an idea and called his two neighbours to the palace.
The kind said to Elephant and Chameleon, “I want you to stomp on the ground with your feet until water comes out.” The king promised the princess in marriage to the one who succeeded.
Chameleon had no hope since he was very small. Elephant was extremely happy since he was so big and powerful. Elephant went to the field and started stomping on the ground.
A lot of dust came, but no water. Elephant stomped on the ground until water was almost coming out, but he was too tired. He gave Chameleon a chance to try.
Chameleon started stomping on the ground. After a short while, water came out. People could not believe their eyes!
So the King gave the beautiful princess to Chameleon. Elephant went home annoyed.

Elephant and Hare were good friends.
They found grass and water for their animals.
They liked to play football.
Elephant scored more goals. Hare was not happy.
Hare asked Elephant, "What makes you a good player?" "My big legs."
Hare and Elephant ran a race. Hare won.
Elephant asked Hare, "What makes you a good runner?" "My thin legs."
Elephant asked, "How can I get thin legs?" "I will show you how."
Hare said, "Stand in the fire." Elephant did. He cried, "I am burning!"
Hare told Elephant, "This is the only way your legs can become thin."
Elephant moved out of the fire. He lay down.
For many days, Elephant was not able to stand.
When he was better, he walked home to his family.
Hare was very sorry. He asked Elephant to forgive him.
Adun was very beautiful. All the men in her village wanted to marry her. But Adun refused them all.
One market day,  a man borrowed legs from another man,  and arms from another,  and a body from a third man. Then this man joined all the parts together. He put his head on top and went to the market.
This man wanted Adun and was determined to marry her. Adun was pleased by his appearance. She wanted to be with him. The man came from a far town,  and Adun decided to return with him.
As Adun and the man journeyed to his place,  the owner of the legs took the legs back. Then the owner of the arms took his arms back. And finally the owner of the body took that back.
Only the head was left,  and the head went on. Adun was scared but she did not run away. They arrived at the house of the head.
The following morning,  before the head went to his farm,  he spoke to Tortoise. "If Adun tries to escape,  blow this horn to tell me," said the head.
After the head left,  Adun packed her things. Then she began to run away.
Seeing her,  Tortoise blew the horn,  "Head,  head,  Adun is about to run away," puffed Tortoise.
The head went up to Adun and said,  "Where do you think you are going?" Adun went back to the head's house.
Eventually Adun consulted a diviner about what to do. The diviner advised,  "Go and buy some bean cakes. Soak them in palm oil and put them in Tortoise's horn."
Adun followed the diviner's instructions. She put the oily cakes into the horn.
The following day,  she took her things and began to run away again. When Tortoise took the horn to blow it,  the delicious bean cakes fell into his mouth.
Tortoise ate,  ate and ate. And Adun ran away.
Have you ever seen a herd of cows in the field? Every now and then you will notice a cow shaking her head. She tries to drive away the flies that pester her. But why do the flies zoom-zoom-zee around Cow's head?
They say it started long, long ago in a far-off country. The country's queen was very rich and had a kind heart. One day she decided to arrange a huge banquet. All the animals were invited. The enormous tables were beautifully laden. Every table groaned under the delicacies, dishes full of meat, freshly baked bread, steaming vegetables and honey-sweet fruit.
The animals smacked their lips when they saw the delicious food. "The largest animal at each table should sit at the head," the queen said. "It is his or her job to dish out the food." Cow shared a table with Sheep, Goat, Dog, Goose and Fly. Since Cow was the biggest, she started dishing out the food. Each animal received a big chunk of home-baked bread with grape jam and cheese.
But because Fly was so small, Cow hardly noticed her. "Zoom! Zoom! Zee! What about me? I'd also like something to eat, you see?" Fly grumbled. But Cow pretended not to hear Fly. She tucked into the delicious bread. Poor Fly sat there deprived of everything, watching the other animals eat.
When they had finished the last crumb of bread, Cow started dishing out the meat and vegetables. Each animal received a large plate of food. But because Fly was so small, Cow once again hardly noticed her. "Zoom! Zoom! Zee! What about me? I'd also like something to eat, you see?" Fly grumbled louder than before. Cow rolled her eyes and was annoyed with Fly.
"Hey! Where are your manners?" Cow said. "A bug like you doesn't even belong at the queen's banquet. You can wait until the bigger animals have finished." The food was finished in two ticks. Poor Fly didn't receive the tiniest morsel. Cow started sharing the fruit. There were delicious water melon, juicy spanspek and red-cheeked apples.
All the animals received food, but Fly had to go without. "Zoom! Zoom! Zee! What about me? I'd also like something to eat, you see?" Fly complained. Cow laughed and took a bite from her apple. "Do you hear something?" she asked the other animals at the table. "I don't hear anything." In a jiffy all the food at the table had been finished. The animals were overstuffed. Everyone except Fly. Her tummy growled with hunger.
After the meal, it was time to dance and be merry. But Fly was angry. She decided to go home. The queen noticed Fly. "Why are you leaving, Fly?" the queen asked. "Don't you enjoy my banquet?" Fly curtsied before the queen. "I'm sorry, your Majesty," she said. "I'm sure the food was delicious. But I didn't have a tiny morsel of food." And she told the queen what had happened. The queen was very angry when she heard what Cow had done.
"From now on you and your friends may pester Cow every day," the queen said. "From morning till night you may buzz around her ears. It will teach her a lesson. She will never be able to ignore you again. And she'll see that even the tiniest insect is important to me."
And that is exactly what Fly has been doing until today. She and her friends buzz around Cow's ears from morning till night. And while they are doing it,  they sing: "Zoom! Zoom! Zee! Never ever again, can you ignore us. Say never!"
It is nearly break time at Siyafunda Primary School. The two spaza shop owners at the school are preparing lunch to sell to hungry children.
In Mr Motaung’s shop, the bread is cut and ready for making kotas. He carefully cuts out the soft middle of each quarter loaf. Then he puts polony and chips in the space inside. Motaung puts two spoonfuls of his wife’s homemade atchar in each kota. He likes to boast that his kotas have atchar inside and atchar on top!
In Mr Mkhize’s shop, the chips are nearly ready, but he is still cutting his bread for kotas. He is worried because things are not going well with his shop. “It started well,” thinks Mkhize. “But now I get fewer and fewer customers. At least I’m reducing some of my costs by cutting five kotas from a loaf.”
Jabu and Zodwa are buying lunch. Zodwa buys from Mr Mkhize. Jabu buys from Mr Motaung. He believes that Motaung’s kota has got more chips and atchar than Mkhize’s kota.
The queue at Mr Motaung’s shop is always longer. Zodwa waits for Jabu. Then the friends sit together in the shade to enjoy their kotas.
Zodwa notices something that makes her stare and frown. “What are you staring at?” asks Jabu. “Your kota! It looks bigger than mine,” says Zodwa.
They both look very closely at their kotas. Sure enough, Jabu’s is bigger. “Something is not right here,” says Zodwa. “I wonder if this is the reason Mr Mkhize’s shop is not busy anymore.” Jabu thinks for a while and then he replies, “Well, I heard that some kids saw Mkhize cutting his bread into five pieces for kotas!”
Nomsa overhears Jabu and Zodwa talking and she’s curious. She asks them what’s wrong with cutting the loaf into five pieces for kotas. Zodwa and Jabu reply together, “A kota is a quarter of a loaf!” Nomsa still looks confused, so Zodwa explains, “The loaf must be cut into four equal pieces. Otherwise, they are not quarters.”
Nomsa is cross because she also buys from Mr Mkhize. “So, he is stealing bread from us!” she says in a loud voice. Zodwa decides to go back to Mkhize’s shop to complain. She marches off, holding her kota up in the air. Nomsa hurries behind her. Jabu sighs and gets up to follow his friends.
Mr Mkhize is disappointed when he sees that the children aren’t new customers. “Oh, hello again kids,” he mutters, “how can I help you?” “Mr Mkhize, I asked you for a quarter and I paid you for a quarter. But this is not a quarter,” says Zodwa, pointing at her kota. “I want a quarter kota or my money back,” she adds firmly.
“Is it true Mr Mkhize? You’ve been cheating us!” cries Nomsa. A few children have followed them to the shop and are now listening to the fierce accusations. Mkhize waves his hands wildly. “What are you saying about me?” he protests. “I’m not like that! I want you to get out of my shop now!”
Then Zodwa says quietly, “We will tell everyone what you are doing. It will spread like wildfire throughout the school. You will have to close your shop. No one will come and buy from you!” Mr Mkhize looks at the three children standing in front of him. Then he looks at the growing crowd outside his shop.
“OK,” he says eventually, “I will give you your money back. “And also promise that you will cut each loaf into quarters for your kotas,” speaks up Jabu. Mr Mkhize promises that he will. Then he clears his throat and says loud enough for everyone to hear, “I also promise that I will add more atchar and more chips to my kotas.”
Mr Mkhize did indeed add extra chips and atchaar to his kotas. Soon more children were buying from him, and his shop started doing well. He was even able to hire someone to help him.
Now there is a healthy competition between Mr Mkhize and Mr Motaung, and everyone is happy.
“I can’t lift you up, Shanu!” says Ammi. “You are too big!”
“You can’t walk to school alone, Shanu!” says Abbu. “You are too small!”
“You can’t sleep in the baby’s cot, Shanu!” says Dadu. “You are too big!”
“You can’t carry the baby to the park, Shanu!” says Dadi. “You are too small!”
Shanu is puzzled. Too big! Too small! How can she be too big andtoo small all at once?
Too big to wear her old pink frock.Too small to make dosas at the stove.
Too big to climb up on Dadu’s back?Too smallto carry the baby on hers?
“What am I the right size for?” Shanu wonders.
Ammi smiles and says, “Why, you are just big enough to go to big school.”
“And you are just small enough for me to carry you on my shoulders,” says Abbu.
“You are just big enough to take me for my morning walks,” says Dadu.
“And you are just small enough for me to tell stories to,” says Dadi.
“And you will always, always be the perfect size...for this!" all say, and give her a warm, wonderful hug.
This is Cat.This is Dog.
Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village.
Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone.
Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, "Is this your egg?"
But the bird says, "No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."
Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, "Is this your egg?"
But the owl says, "No, that is not my egg. Ask the goose.  Maybe it is her egg."
Cat and Dog walk to the goose. They ask the goose, "Is this your egg?"
But the goose says, "No, that is not my egg. Ask the two ducks. Maybe it is their egg."
Cat and Dog walk to the two ducks. They ask the two ducks, "Is this your egg?"
But the two ducks say, "No, that is not our egg." Then the egg breaks.
There is a lizard in the egg. A baby lizard.
The baby lizard says, "Where is my mother? Where is my father? Where are my mother and father?" Cat and Dog bring the baby lizard to his mother and father.
Bye bye Cat. Bye bye Dog. Bye bye baby lizard.
My mother planted.She planted a small garden.She planted a small garden of peas.
My father planted. He planted a small garden.  He planted a small garden of flowers.

The small garden of peas yielded sacks of peas. The small garden of flowers yielded sacks of flowers.
There was a young beautiful mule called Wardit.
A handsome horse said, “I must marry Wardit.”
The horse said, “Let us go together to the river.”
The horse asked Wardit to be his wife. Wardit agreed.
The horse asked Wardit, “Who are your father and mother?”
Wardit said, “My mother lives in the king’s palace.”
“My sister lives in the Church compound. Don’t you know her?”
She added, “My beautiful aunt lives with the village headman.”
Then an old donkey walked by. It was Wardit’s father.
Wardit did not greet her father or look at him.
The old donkey asked, “What is the matter, my girl?"
The horse asked Wardit, “Who is this stupid donkey?”
Wardit said, “I don’t know him.”
The horse kicked the old donkey.
The old donkey was heart-broken. He cried and died.
Because Wardit did not respect her father, she cannot have children.
Don was a big baboon. He was a bully.
He was the baboon chief.
His followers gave him a special cloth.
"I will wear this on my head," said Don.
"Everyone follow my orders. Do not question me!" shouted Don.
So,  the followers followed their chief. If Don jumped,  everyone jumped.
But the band on Don's head was too tight.
He touched his sore head. The baboons touched their heads.
"This hurts," said Don. "This hurts," they copied.
"This is too tight!" "This is too tight," they copied.
Don fell down,  over a cliff. They all copied him.
The baboon chief died. His followers were hurt,  but they lived.
The drum has always been an important musical instrument in our community. We love drums!We have drums of different sizes: big, medium-sized and small.
We play drums using beaters, or with our fingers.We play drums for various reasons. We play drums with songs and dances, for feasts and in bad times.
Drums enrich songs and make people want to dance. Drums make ceremonies colourful.We play drums during ceremonies for marriage and child naming. We play drums when celebrating a new harvest or a twin birth.
We sound drums to announce grief and call people when death occurs.
We sound drums to call people to clean wells, clear roads, or to build a hut for a needy old person.We sound drums to call people when cattle are stolen in our village.
We sound drums to gather people for meetings at our chief's palace.
Drums call people to go to church for prayers on Sundays, and other prayer days.We also play drums to enrich songs when singing in churches.
The big drum sounds, "An a bul mba, an a bul mba, an a bul mba-mba-mbamba bul."The small drums sing in their high pitches, "Tindiri, tindiri tindiri ti."Together they chorus, "Tindiri mba, tindiri mba, tindiri mba-mba-mbamba, tindiri ti!"
Muniafu lived with his grandparents,  his aunt,  an uncle,  a hen,  a goat,  a sheep and a pig. The hen stayed in a small cage. The goat,  sheep and pig were each tied on the side of the wall. The grandparents were still well,  and the aunt and uncle helped with the work.
This changed few years later. Muniafu's grandparents aged and could not hear or see well. His aunt became sickly and could not help clean the house. His uncle slept all the time and did not help to feed the animals.
The animals made so much noise because they were hungry. The house was so dirty because the aunt did not clean it. Muniafu was tired all the time because he went out every day to look for food for them all.
Muniafu could not cope with the situation anymore. He went to ask his elderly grandparents for a solution. He was unhappy because his grandparents did not hear him. His sick aunt said,  "All I want is to be able to sleep at night and wake up in the morning."
His lazy uncle said,  "Sell the animals and buy alcohol for your grandparents. They will sleep and won't bother you." Muniafu was angry. He said,  "Uncle,  you know that I cannot sell the animals. They are the only wealth I have."
One night Muniafu lay awake. He remembered a wise man who was believed to have solutions to all problems. Muniafu took his animals and visited the wise man. He kept a rope on the goat,  sheep and pig and carried the hen.
Muniafu arrived at the wise man's home,  tired and hungry. After explaining his problem to the wise man,  the wise man said,  "I will help you but you must do as I say." Muniafu replied,  "I will do anything to solve my problem."
The wise man said,  "Leave the animals here and go back to your house." Muniafu said,  "But I have lived with my animals for a long time. They are the only wealth I have."
The wise man said,  "I told you I would help you but you must do as I say." Muniafu needed a solution to his problem so much that he left his animals and returned home.
His house was too quiet and empty. Everybody missed the animals. Muniafu's grandparents complained because they had no milk from the goat. The uncle said,  "We are so poor,  everyone is laughing at us."
Muniafu could not cope with the complaints anymore. Besides,  he missed his animals. He returned to the wise man to ask for advice. "Life is very different without my animals in the house. My relatives are complaining so much."
The wise man said,  "I will help you but you must do as I tell you. Go home and take your grandparents out of the house." Muniafu said,  "How can I do that? They are my grandparents and they depend on me."
In the end,  Muniafu went home and did as he was told. He did not have any peace of mind. His grandparents had nowhere to go. They wandered around,  trying not to bump into things. They felt the heat during the day and the cold at night.
His sick aunt cried,  "Don't throw me out!" His lazy uncle cried,  "Don't throw me out either!"
Muniafu could not take it anymore. He returned to the wise man confused and angry. He cried saying,  "This is too much for one person. Give me a better solution."
The wise man said,  "Here,  take your animals home and return your grandparents in the house."  Muniafu did as he was told. His aunt said,  "I will clean the house." His uncle stopped being lazy and helped Muniafu with work. They were all happy once more.

Tenzin and Tashi were two young Tibetan monks. They lived in a small monastery on a beautiful green hill. Here, it was lovely when it rained.When Tashi looked out of the window late one morning, the rain was coming down hard. Rivulets were forming where the water had made paths on the muddy road. Tashi couldn’t think of a better way to spend the afternoon than sailing paper boats.Tashi and Tenzin set about making many paper boats. As soon as it stopped raining, the boys ran outside. They sailed the paper boats they had made – some big, some small. The boats floated nicely along the path. The two young monks were happy.
As they trotted back home, they saw Gen Lobsang. Genla lived in the monastery and told the children the most wonderful stories. “Genla,” shouted Tenzin. “Can you tell us a story about why boats float?” Gen Lobsang thought for a minute and said, “I don’t know why boats – or ships, for that matter – float. But I am curious to find out.”Genla: A polite way of addressing the teacher in Tibetan
Genla and the children decided to go and ask Miss Sonam, the science teacher, if she knew why boats float. Tenzin and Tashi gently pulled Gen Lobsang from his chair. They held his hands to help him walk. When they reached her room, Miss Sonam was reading a book. “Tashi delek,” said Genla, Tashi and Tenzin. “Tashi delek,” she replied.“We have a question for you,” said Genla. Tashi delek: A common Tibetan greeting; tashi means ‘good fortune’ and delek means ‘well being’.
“Yes, can you tell us what makes boats float on water, Miss?” Tenzin asked.“I can,” said Miss Sonam. “Or maybe we can find out together?”Before they knew it, Miss Sonam was giving instructions. “Tenzin, please bring a plastic basin from the kitchen.”“Tashi, please fetch a small bucket of water.”“Genla, hold this apple. Please don’t eat it.”
Miss Sonam asked Tashi to fill the tub to the brim. “Now, Genla,” she said, “dip the apple in the tub, please. Enough to cover it completely in water.”
Genla gently dropped the fruit into the tub and pushed it down with his little finger. Some water spilled. Tashi and Tenzin shrieked, “The water is overflowing!”Genla let go of the apple, and it rose up.Miss Sonam was smiling. “What happened here?” she asked.
“Genla pushed the apple into the water,” said Tenzin. “Water spilled,” said Tashi. “The apple’s floating,” said Genla.“Correct answers, all of you!” said Miss Sonam. “Now, can you tell me how much water spilled, Tenzin? Was it about half a cup? One cup?”
Tenzin looked at the water on the table and on the floor. He said, “Maybe one cup.”“That sounds right,” said Miss Sonam. Genla and Tashi nodded in agreement. “Now, take the apple out. Tashi, fill up the tub again. Here, Tenzin. Will you drop this spoon into the water?”Tenzin did. The spoon sank to the bottom.“Too heavy,” said Genla.“Not as heavy as a ship in the sea,” said Tenzin.“Very little water spilled this time, not even a quarter of a cup!” said Tashi, a little sad. “Again, you’re all correct,” said Miss Sonam.
Then she asked: “Do you see? After Genla dropped the apple into the water, the apple pushed some water away before it could float.”“Is that the water that spilled?” asked Tenzin.“Yes. So the apple could float because it pushed away more water than its own weight. That means, the apple is lighter than the water it pushed away.”“What about the spoon then?” Genla said.“Well, the spoon also pushed some water away. But much less. Certainly less than its own weight. So it sank.”
“What about large ships in the sea, on which there are many people?” asked Tenzin.  “...and many spoons that sink?” added Tashi. “The spoons won’t make a ship sink, Tashi. The ship is big enough to push away a lot of water. Again, like the apple, more water than its own weight. You don’t notice it because  in the ocean, there is so much water. The ship is still lighter than the amount of water that it pushes away.” They were all quiet for a bit. “I think I understand,” said Tenzin, slowly.
“Can we sail some boats now?” asked Tashi.“It’s time for my tea,” said Genla. Miss Sonam smiled. “Yes, enjoy yourselves!” she said, and gave the boys colour paper to make boats.
Tenzin and Tashi made more colourful boats and set them down in the water. “I don’t see any water spilling now,” said Tashi. “No, silly. The water doesn’t always spill. It just gets pushed away,” replied Tenzin. “I think the boats just make some space for themselves in the stream,” said Genla. They watched the blue and yellow boats, red and green boats, and white boats sailing. Like prayer flags floating in the stream.
What is Gravity?What would happen if Tenzin dropped a football from the top of a tree? Would it fall to the ground or rise towards the sky? That’s right, it would fall because of a force called gravity. Did you know that everything gets pulled towards the earth by that force?
What is Buoyancy?What would happen if Tashi dropped a football into a bucket of water? Would gravity pull the football to the bottom of the bucket? Yes, but in water, there is an upward force that opposes gravity. It is called buoyancy. As gravity tries to pull the football down, buoyancy tries to push it up. In the case of the football, buoyancy is stronger than gravity. So it floats. What would happen if he drops a brick into the bucket? Why?
What is Displacement?When you drop an object into water, it tries to make space for itself by pushing some water aside. In other words, the object displaces water to make space for itself. Bigger objects, like a basketball, displace more water than smaller ones, like a cricket ball. A long time ago, a Greek scientist named Archimedes discovered that when the weight of the water displaced by an object is more than the weight of the object, it floats. That is why apples float in water. Can you guess why other objects sink?
What is Density?Every object around us is made of tiny particles that can’t be seen with the naked eye. Density is how closely these particles are packed in an object. The weight of Tashi’s small glass marble may be the same as Miss Sonam’s apple. But why is the apple bigger? Because there is more space between the particles in the apple. In the marble, the particles are much closer to each other. An apple is less dense than a marble. Generally, dense objects sink in water. Here’s a game you can play with your friends: Pick four or five objects. Guess which ones will float and which will sink. Then drop them into a bucket or tub of water to check. Have fun!

Many years ago, Sun and Water were great friends. Both lived on earth together.
Sun used to visit Water very often, but Water never went to visit Sun.
At last Sun asked Water why he never came to visit. Water replied that Sun's house was too small. "If I come with my family we will drive you out," he said.
Then Water said, "If you wish me to visit you, build a very large compound. My people are very many, and take up a lot of room." Sun promised to build a very big compound.
Sun returned home to his wife, Moon, who greeted him with a broad smile. Sun told Moon what he had promised Water.
The next day he started building a huge compound in which to entertain his friend.
As soon as the compound was completed, he asked Water to come and visit them.
When Water arrived, he asked Sun whether it would be safe for him to enter."Yes, come in, my friend," Sun answered.
Water began to flow in. He was accompanied by crocodiles, fish, frogs, snakes, snails, flukes, turtles, and all the water animals.
Very soon Water was knee-deep. He asked Sun if it was still safe."Yes," Sun again answered. So more of water's people  came in.
Water reached the level of the top of a person's head. He asked Sun, "Can more of my people come in?" Sun and Moon both answered, "Yes." Water flowed on, until Sun and Moon had to perch themselves on the top of the roof.
Water's people continued to rush in. Very soon they reached the top of the roof. Sun and Moon were forced to go up into the sky. They have remained in the sky ever since.
A long time ago,  there was a greedy Hyena.
There was also Tortoise. Hyena and Tortoise were friends.
Hyena told Tortoise,  "Let us search for honey."
Hyena ran fast. Tortoise followed slowly. He was afraid.
They crossed a river. They got wet.
Then they saw beehives. Hyena ran to the hives.
Hyena told Tortoise,  "Climb up and get the beehive."
Tortoise climbed slowly. Hyena was angry. He shouted at Tortoise.
Tortoise touched the beehive. Bees swarmed in the air.
Tortoise fell. The beehive fell on him. Hyena licked the honey.
The bees stung Hyena. He ran. The bees followed him.
Hyena ran into the river. The bees still followed him.

There lived two co-wives. They shared the same hut with their husband.
For a long time, neither wife had a child. Then, the first wife became pregnant. She gave birth at a time when the husband was not at home.
The second wife felt jealous towards the first wife and her baby. She began to think of ways of killing her co-wife so that she could have the husband alone.
During that time, people did not cook food. They ate it raw.
The second wife said, "I will cook the food so that I poison my co-wife."She believed that cooked food could kill a person.
She cooked food for her co-wife for many days. However, instead of dying, the first wife became healthier and healthier because of cooked food.
When the husband returned home, he found a new baby, the first wife healthier and the food being cooked.
The husband was amazed by the cooking of food and he asked, "Who taught you to cook!"The second wife whispered to the husband and said, "I am cooking so that I poison my co-wife."
"I am jealous of her for having had a baby while I have not. I feel you will chase me away."
The husband was angry and warned her, "Stop being evil minded."
The husband gathered his wives and made peace between them.
They all agreed to cook food because it made them healthier.That is how the cooking of food began!
I had never worn shoes before. When I saw children wearing nice shoes, I would look at them with longing.
My mother would say, "You will have many pairs in the future, just wait!" Sometimes I did not believe her. "When is the future?" I asked her one day.
Time passed and it was nearly Christmas. Everybody was busy going to the market and coming back with bags of new things. "Mother, are we going to the market?" I asked her.
The day before Christmas, my mother woke me up earlier than usual. She asked me to fetch the big shopping basket she always carried to the market.
At the open-air market there, were many parents with their children. They were buying new clothes and stocking up on food.
We went straight to where there were many different types of shoes. My eyes were wide with amazement. I gaped at row after row of neatly arranged shoes.
After trying on many pairs, I settled for black lace-up shoes. At home that night, I couldn't sleep. I was so excited thinking of how I would wear my new shoes and show off to every child in the village.
After a while, I got out of bed and put on the shoes. I walked slowly around the room and then put the shoes back into the box. I lay down again, but I couldn't sleep.
I got up and tried on the shoes a second time. I strutted around the room for a while and then put them back.
I lay down once more and tried to sleep. But I got up a third time. I put on the shoes and jumped around the room. Then I felt tired. I decided to get back into bed.
The following morning, I was woken by my mother. "What is this I see?" she asked.
I was wearing my new shoes in bed!
One day, mama bought different fruits.
“When can we have some fruit?” we asked.“We will eat the fruit tonight,” said mama.
My brother Rahim is greedy. He tasted all the fruit.He ate a lot of it.
“Look at what Rahim did!” shouted my little brother. “Rahim is naughty and selfish,” I said.
Mama was angry with Rahim.
We were also angry with Rahim.But Rahim was not sorry.
“Are you going to punish Rahim?” asked little brother.
“Rahim, you will be sorry soon,” warned mama.
Rahim started feeling unwell.
“My stomach is painful,” whispered Rahim.
Mama knew why Rahim was sick.“The fruit is punishing Rahim,” she thought.
Later, Rahim said sorry to us. “I will never be so greedy again,” he promised. We believed him.
Akoro is a young man married to Chichi. They live in Kanam village in Turkana County. Akoro has a banana garden which yields a good harvest.
One morning before the sun got hot, Akoro set out with a crate of bananas on his head. He walked confidently to Kilindo market, only a kilometre away from his home.
On the way, men and women of his age stared at him in surprise. Others even laughed out loud shouting, “Akoro is definitely bewitched. How can he do such a job? Men from our community do not sell bananas!” But Akoro never minded. He was a determined and hardworking man who was ready to do any job.
As soon as Akoro reached the market, he arranged the bananas on a stand and stood beside them waiting for customers. He wondered, “Will anyone stop to buy my bananas?”
Few minutes later, a woman dressed in a purple dress stopped next to Akoro's banana stand. “How much is a kilo of bananas?” the woman asked. “Fifty shillings, madam,” Akoro replied respectfully.
The woman said, “Please pack for me a kilo and a half.” The woman continued, “You must reduce the price.” Akoro answered, “No problem madam, I will reduce by ten shillings. You are my first customer.” Akoro handed over the bananas to the woman.
Akoro began enjoying his business. The beautiful ripe bananas and his sweet words made every passerby want to taste the bananas.
At mid day, Akoro was already tired standing. He brought a stool and sat down to continue selling the bananas. A woman in a dark blue dress came and bought a large amount of bananas. Those who had laughed at Akoro, started wondering about Akoro's flourishing banana business.
At about three in the afternoon, Akoro made his final sales. He gave two bananas to the gentlemen who had stayed with him all the time. They had entertained him throughout the day. Akoro sold the last bananas to a lady who was on her way from work.
Late in the evening, Akoro walked home with his empty crate on his head. As he walked, he sang a joyful song feeling proud of himself. He thought, “Hard work and determination are key things in life.”
Close home, Akoro stopped by the first kiosk and bought maize flour, cooking oil, tea, sugar and bread for his family. He then went home a very happy man. He was full of plans of how to expand the banana business.

Once upon a time, in the village of Mphahlele, there was a young man who lived with his parents.
This young man was very respectful to his parents and to all the other people in the village. His name was Thabo Maloba.
Mondays are a busy day in the village as the children get ready for school after the weekend.One day, on his way to school, Thabo met a boy called Sparks. They chatted along the way and became friends.
Sparks was always fighting, bullying others and bunking school. He was a bad person who gambled and enjoyed the company of other bad people. Slowly but surely Sparks influenced Thabo. Thabo did not want to be seen as uncool and he started behaving as badly as Sparks.
Thabo became a bully and disrespected his parents and people he used to respect. He became a drunkard and was unable to look after himself.
Thabo became reckless and got sexually transmitted infections. He became so thin that Sparks made jokes and didn't want to be his friend any more. Thabo's parents encouraged him to visit a local clinic to get medication. After taking medication he became better.
Thabo reflected on his life. He realised that he had befriended an enemy. He started working at school and apologised to his parents and teachers.
Sparks was disappointed by Thabo's good behaviour. But he was embarrassed by his own behaviour and decided to change and became a better person.
There once lived a king in the southern part of Okugbe Island. This king had not known pain in his life. Not even for a minute.
One morning he was imagining what pain would be like. His head was bowed, "There are so many poor people in my land. How can I feel their pain?" he asked himself.
Day and night, he wished he could experience pain just once. Then one night, he dreamed and heard a voice. "I have heard your wishes. You will experience pain," said the voice.
The voice continued, "Build seven large boats that can contain all your wealth and family. Then sail away to the northern part of Okugbe Island." The king was very happy.
Soon, the seven boats were built and ready to sail. The king loaded them with his wealth.
The day before the king and his family left, he held a feast. Everyone attended. Leopards, snakes, rabbits, snails, birds and even ants came to the feast.
The king addressed the people, "My family and I are going away to the other part of Okugbe Island. We want to feel the pain that other people feel."
People whispered amongst themselves. The elders did not believe him. But who could question the king? So everyone drank and feasted.
The next day, the king and his family sailed away.For the first two days, the boats rolled through the waters. The sky was clear, the sea was calm and the trip was a happy one.
On the third day, the sea became rough. The sky became cloudy. A great storm came upon them. The boats were overturned. The king was helpless as his wealth and family were lost to the sea.
The king alone survived. But he was now a kingfisher bird. Kingfisher flew to the shore. He still hoped to get his family and wealth back from the sea.
Kingfisher dived into the sea many times. He was not able to rescue his family or even part of his wealth. "If only I had known, I would have been happy with my life," he cried silently.

Coffee is a plant which has fruit. The fruit are berries. Inside the berries are seeds. The seeds are coffee beans.
There are legends about the discovery of coffee. One of them is the legend of Kaldi in Ethiopia.
Kaldi was a young Ethiopian shepherd.
One day his goats ate red berries off the coffee plant and Kaldi noticed that they started jumping around.
Kaldi was eager to know whether the berries gave the goats energy. He chewed the fruit. The taste was extremely bitter!
After a while, Kaldi felt alert and full of energy.
He picked some of the coffee fruit and took it home.
He gave some fruit to his wife.
His wife chewed the berries and felt the same effects that Kaldi had felt.
Kaldi and his wife thought that it was a gift from God.
Days later, Kaldi took some of the fruit and leaves of the coffee plant to a nearby monastery.
Kaldi told the whole story to the monks, and then left the monastery.
The monks secretly followed Kaldi to check whether what he had told them was true.
The monks saw that everything Kaldi told them was true. The goats were in a playful mood.
Back at monastery, the monks told the other monks to boil the coffee fruit.
The monks drank the boiled fruit and found it terribly bitter! They thought that it was a devil's drink.
They threw the remains of the fruit onto a fire. Suddenly, a nice aroma came from the fire.
A noble idea of roasting, then boiling the seeds came to their minds.
After they had drunk this flavourful beverage, they stayed alert and felt energetic.
Since then, people have drunk brewed coffee to stay awake.
Coffee drinking started in Ethiopia and spread across the world!
Long time ago, Cassava and Palm lived in a village called Koowa. They were very good friends. They visited each other everyday. They were farmers. They worked very hard ontheir farms.
In a certain year, there was no rain. The crops did not grow well.  All the plants dried up. People did not have any food to eat.Cassava and Palm decided to travel to another village to look for work.
On their way, they met a woman. “Good afternoon,” they greeted her.She responded and asked,“Where are you going?”“We are going to the nextvillage to look for work,”said Palm.
“What work can you do?” the woman asked. The friends responded, “We can provide food for your family and animals.”The woman asked, “What do you need to provide the food?” “Give us land, water and good care,” they replied.
The woman took them home with her.
One afternoon, Palm tree and Cassava had an argument. Cassava said he was more important than Palm.Palm said he was more important than Cassava.
The woman heard them from her room. She came out and asked “Why are you fighting?”
Cassava spoke first. “I am more important than Palm tree. I provide tubers for your fufu, gari, boiled cassava and cassava dough.”
“My stems are used for planting. My leaves and peels feed your animals. What does Palm tree do?” asked Cassava.
Palm tree laughed, shook his head and said, “Woman, do you remember the palm soup you enjoy so much? I provide it.”
“I provide the palm oil for preparing kpokpoi and the palm kernel oil for frying fish and meat. How would you prepare stews and gravies without oil?”
“In addition, my fronds provide shade for your huts. You cool your heart with my sweet, rich, foamy palm wine after your hard day's work.”
“Above all, the brooms that are used to sweep the rooms and compounds come from me,” concluded Palm.
“Hmmm!” sighed the woman. “Alright friends, I have heard you. I will settle this problem.”
“Both of you are very important to me. The two of you together make a delicious meal, fufu and palm-nut soup!” said the woman.
The woman prepared palm nut soup with fufu from cassavas. She invited her friends to eat with her. They enjoyed the meal very much.Since then, Cassava and Palm tree have remained good friends.

One day, my big sister  Zinhle had this idea. "I am going to make masks for those people in the community who don't have masks!" she said. "That's a good idea! Let's tell Mama and Baba when they get home!" I said.
When Mama and Baba arrived home, we told them about Zinhle's idea. "That's a good idea, my child!" Baba said, and Mama agreed. "I will ask our church members to give us cloth to make the masks. Let's ask Gogo to help with sewing."
The next day, the church ladies dropped off colourful cloth and elastic at our house.Zinhle left some cloth and elastic in a bag outside Gogo's door, with a note asking Gogo to help.
Zinhle started stitching masks and Wandile and I watched her. Zinhle is very good at stitching. She stitched many masks. Wandile and I counted the masks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, then, 100!
Zinhle and Gogo made enough masks for everyone in the community! We helped them!Mama and Baba were so proud.
The next day, Baba and Mama were not working. They decided to give out the masks to anyone who needed a mask. Zinhle carried Mama's hand sanitiser and sprayed people's hands. "Remember to wash your mask every day," said Mama.
Now when Zinhle goes to get water, everyone is wearing masks. Everyone looks and feels safer.
Later, Mama asked, "Children, what do we do after we touch anything?""We wash our hands with soap and water!" Wandile said. "Or use sanitiser," I added.Mama smiled, "And what do we wear when we go out?" We all shouted, "Our masks!"
1. Wash your hands with water.2. Use soap to wash your hands.3. Wash for 20 seconds or slowly count from 1 to 20.4. Rinse your hands with water.5. Dry your hands with clean towel or tissue.6. Now your hands are clean!

When Rohan woke up, he began to play with Jimmy, his dog.“There’s something you should do first!” said Riya, his big sister. “BRUSH YOUR TEETH!”WOOF!
“I don’t want to brush my teeth! Jimmy doesn’t brush his teeth!”“Animals take care of their teeth too, but in other ways! We must brush our teeth to keep germs away!”“Germs?”“Germs are very tiny creatures that you cannot see. If you don’t brush properly, they stay in your mouth and hurt you!”“Ouch!”“YES! That’s why we must take good care of our teeth by brushing twice a day - morning and night!”“But brushing is no fun!”“I’ll tell you a secret, Rohan! Psst…”  Rohan smiled.
Mummy called out, “It’s breakfast time!” “There’s something we should do first!” said Riya. “WASH OUR HANDS!”WOOF!
“But Jimmy never washes his hands!”Riya laughed, “He doesn’t use his hands or paws to eat like we do! We must wash our hands with soap to get rid of germs.”“Are germs on our hands too?”“Germs are EVERYWHERE!”WOOF!“Aaaah-chhhooo!” Riya covered her mouth with her hands as she sneezed.“Don't do that! My teacher says that we should sneeze into our sleeve, not our hands!" said Rohan.“Why?”“Because when we sneeze into our hands, germs stick to them. If we don’t wash our hands, we spread germs and make others sick!”
“Here comes Germy!” Riya shouted, chasing Rohan and waving herdirty hands.  “EEEEEEEK!”WOOF!
Later Riya showed Rohan the proper way to wash hands. “Wet your hands and turn off the tap. Then rub in some soap on the palms, the back of the hands and between the fingers. Scrub hands for twenty seconds! Now, it’s time to rinse off and dry!”“But that’s a long time!”“Remember my secret?”Rohan smiled.
When they came back home after playing, Riya nudged Rohan, “There’s something we should do first!”Mummy teased, “Play some more?”“TAKE A BATH!”“Mummy, don’t you know that germs are everywhere? We can’t see them, but they stick to our skin and clothes!”“That’s why we must bathe every day…” “…to get rid of them!”
"Start by getting yourself wet,” said Mummy. “Then apply soap all over!” Riya and Rohan giggled as Mummy’s ticklish fingers soaped them up.“Then it’s time to rinse off!”“And dry with a clean towel!”“SUPERCLEAN!”WOOF! “It’s Jimmy’s turn next!”
“Do you want to listen to a story?” asked Papa.
“There’s something we should do first!” reminded Riya. “Tidy UP!”Rohan yawned. “Do we have to?”“Remember you couldn’t find your ball the other day? Putting things away in the proper place makes it easy to find them later!”“And keeps our house neat!” “You both are so smart!” said Papa proudly. “Bedtime!”“Papa! There’s something we should do first!” said Riya, pulling Rohan along.“Make the germs disappear with our magic secret!”Rohan nodded.
A few minutes later, Mummy and Papa heard a familiar tune. “So that’s your secret!” said Papa. “Humming a song to make brushing fun!”“And while washing our hands too!”“That’s a great idea!” said Mummy.WOOF!Rohan and Riya enjoy taking care of themselves. Do you? They make up a game with the germs and guess who wins?
Germs say, yucky, mucky and dirty is FUN!I say, I brush and wash and I know I have won!Germs say, never bathe, it’s a waste of time!I say, smelling nice with soap is so fine.Naughty germ says don’t pick up your things, The house looks better that way.I say, I tidy up because I like my thingsThat is a good way to end my day!And I feel better in every wayI feel better in every way! I FEEL BETTER IN EVERY WAY!!!!!Now make up your secret song and hum it when you have to do boring things!
My name is Sam. Last year, I ranked last in my class.My friends laughed at me.
Our teacher said, “Sam why don’t you think about why you came last in the class.”
I thought hard. Why did I come in last?I decided to observe the other students and see what they did.Aha!They read books. They take notes. They study!
I told my mother “Mom, I would like to do better in class.”“You can do better, Sam," she said.
That evening, I grabbed my books and studied. My sister also helped me with my work.
Mother said, “Read  books, do your homework, and ask your teachers questions so that they can help you,”
The more I studied, the more my reading skills improved. I continued working hard with my friends, Matata and Jeni.
I asked teachers when I had questions and they were happy to help.
One day, we had a test in the class. When the results were out, I was no longer the last.“Hurrrayyy!”
I was the happiest boy in the class.“So… I can do it,” I told myself.I decided to work harder than ever before!
At the end of the term, the teacher read out the results.The third in rank was Matata. The second was Jeni.Guess who was first?
“The first is … Sam!”
The teacher gave me books and a bag as a prize. “Sam, do you have anything to tell your friends?” she asked. “Yes!” I said. “You can do better too if you want. I was the last. Now, I’m the first. It’s all because I worked hard and had help from my friends.”
When I went home, my mother saw my happy face and immediately knew I had good news. “Sam, you are all smiles,” she said. “Do you have something to tell me?"“Yes, I am first in my class! Look at my nice new bag. Look at the books! From now on, I’ll always work hard.”
There is a boy named Rodney. He lives with his family. His mother and father are Jamima and Mike. His sisters are Suzy and Lola. Rodney is the last born child.
Rodney loves playing chess. He loves it so much that whenever he plays chess, he does not talk.
One day, when Rodney was at school playing chess, he realised that the game could be about his family.
Mike is the King. Jamima is the queen, which is why she has power. Suzy and Lola are the knights and bishops. Rodney is the pawn because he is younger.
After realising this, Rodney ran home to tell his family.
They all laughed at him at first. But later they understood. Rodney explained their roles and why he is a pawn.
Rodney told his mom that she is the queen, and his father a king. His sisters are knights and bishops.
Rodney is a pawn because he likes adventure! He can become anything he wants, even if he has to make some sacrifices.

There once lived a king in the southern part of Okugbe Island. This king had not known pain in his life. Not even for a minute.
One morning he was imagining what pain would be like. His head was bowed, “There are so many poor people in my land. How can I feel their pain?” he asked himself.
Day and night, he wished he could experience pain just once. Then one night, he dreamed and heard a voice. “I have heard your wishes. You will experience pain,” said the voice.
The voice continued, “Build seven large boats that can contain all your wealth and family. Then sail away to the northern part of Okugbe Island.” The king was very happy.
Soon, the seven boats were built and ready to sail. The king loaded them with his wealth.
The day before the king and his family left, he held a feast. Everyone attended. Leopards, snakes, rabbits, snails, birds and even ants came to the feast.
The king addressed the people, “My family and I are going away to the other part of Okugbe Island. We want to feel the pain that other people feel.”
People whispered amongst themselves. The elders did not believe him. But who could question the king? So everyone drank and feasted.
The next day, the king and his family sailed away. For the first two days, the boats rolled through the waters. The sky was clear, the sea was calm and the trip was a happy one.
On the third day, the sea became rough. The sky became cloudy. A great storm came upon them.The boats were overturned. The king was helpless as his wealth and family were lost to the sea.
The king alone survived. But he was now a kingfisher bird.Kingfisher flew to the shore. He still hoped to get his family and wealth back from the sea.
Kingfisher dived into the sea many times. He was not able to rescue his family or even part of his wealth.“If only I had known, I would have been happy with my life,” he cried silently.
It is hot sunny Saturday morning on the farm. Maya, Duksie and Doobie are helping Mama K in her vegetable garden. The children work all morning. They dig compost into the soil. They weed and water. Then they harvest what is ripe and ready. Today each of the children will take home freshly picked strawberries, spinach and carrots.
Mama K always gives the children a treat for helping her. Sometimes its cake or chocolate, or she buys longsweets that look like snakes. Sometimes it's apples, pears or oranges. Mama K has only one rule. “Share it fair!” The children know they must share the treats equally, so they all get the same amount.
Today Mama K has baked a round strawberry cake with pink icing and berries from her garden. The childrenwait on the grass for their treat. “Here you go!” smiles Mama K. “But remember the rule. Everyone must get the same. Share it fair! Don't fight!”
Maya has the first turn to share the cake. She uses the knife to trace lines in the icing. The others watch her. She does not cut the cake yet. The others must first agree if her way is fair. “I think I will make two cuts down like this. Now we have three slices, all the same!” Maya shows them.
“No way!” says Duksie, “the one in the middle is much too big!” Doobie also shakes his head. Maya laughs and shrugs and tells Duksie to try.
“Here! Pass me the knife, I'll do it. Easy peasy!” chants Duksie. First she rubs out Maya's pattern in the icing and licks her fingers.
Then she makes one cut across and one down. “Look, I made my three slices!” “That's not fair!” shout Mayaand Doobie together.
“Share it fair! The pieces must be the same size and shape,” adds Doobie. “Why don't you try Doobie, SmartyPants?” smirks Duksie. “I bet you can't do it!”
“I wish the cake was a square or a rectangle, and then it would be easy!” says Doobie thoughtfully. “Or, if there were four of us to share the round cake that would also be easy,” says Maya.
And then! A picture comes into Doobie's head. He sees the sparkling silver badge at the front of his father's big red truck. On Sundays he helps his dad to wash the truck, and to polish the shiny badge. “I've got it! I've got it!I know how to do it,” yells Doobie.
“You are full of surprises, Doobie,” says Duksie sweetly. “How did you work it out?” Maya asks. Doobie smiles to himself. For now it his secret. Later, he will tell his dad.
First he uses a knife to smooth Duksie's lines in the icing. Then he traces three lines on the cake. It looksjust like the badge on his dad's truck, with three equal parts.
Just then Mama K comes out of her house. She is carrying a tray with three glasses of cold strawberry juice. “Look Mama K! Doobie found the way to cut the cake into three equal pieces,” Maya tells her. “Well done Doobie,three equal slices! You shared fairly, I'm proud of you all. Now cut the cake and drink your juice. It's time to go home. I will give you plates to take your pieces of cake.”
Maya cuts along Doobie's lines to make three equal slices. Just for fun, the children stack the slices on top of each other to check that they are the same size. Yes they are!
Doobie's dad arrives to pick up the children, and Doobie runs off to meet him. He can't wait to tell his dad how the badge on the truck helped him to solve a very tricky problem!
Wayan lived in a small village by the sea.The people there believed that when you died, you returned to the sea. The sea is a special place where the ancestors live.
Wayan learned to fish just as everything was changing for the fishermen. There were fewer fish, and they were always small. Sometimes, the boats came back empty, even though they had been at sea all day.
One day, while Wayan was fishing, a storm blew over. He was swept into the waves. A turtle saved him. "I am Bintang. I will help you, climb onto my back," said the turtle."Maybe you can help me. My grandfather is very sick and no one knows what to do."
Finally, the thing came out. It was a plastic straw! The straw had stuck down grandfather's throat. Grandfather began to breathe more easily. Bintang said to Wayan, "I will take you to the others."They went to Turtle Hospital. "What happened to these turtles?" asked Wayan.
Wayan promised that he would do his best to help. Bintang carried him back to the shore, and then swam away. Wayan realised that the villagers needed to clean up the sea and beaches. He ran to the elders to tell them about the turtles.
People agreed to a ban on plastic straws, plastic bottles and plastic bags. They agreed to throw their trash into trash bins only, and to stop burning and burying plastic. They decided to stop fishing until the sea was clean.
Eventually, the sea and beaches returned to the way they were before Wayan was born.The water was clean and full of life. People were no longer sick from eating sick fish.Wayan learned that when the sea is polluted, we all suffer. When the sea is healthy, we can all be happy.
Once upon a time, there was a long dry spell. The animals ate all the grass in the country. Only the imbowa plants on the big trees survived.
One day Goat saw Hyena pass by with a knife. Goat asked for the knife so that she could cut imbowa plants to eat.
Hyena gave the knife to Goat. She cut down the climbing plant, and ate until she was full. Goat forgot all about the knife she had used.
When Hyena returned to ask for the knife, Goat was at a loss. She could not remember where she had dropped it.
Goat scratched here and there in search of the knife. Up to today Goat is still looking for that knife.
Hyena told Goat, "Since you have lost my knife, which was the source of my livelihood, I will eat you. Then I will eat your offspring!"
From that time, Hyena has never spared Goat.
Meanwhile, Goat continues to search for Hyena's knife.

"Where?" Dad climbed out the window as he heard that.The curtains all fell down as he pulled."There!" Mom jumped on the table shouting. The plates in it fell down and broke.
﻿"Catch the mouse," Mithun looked at the cat and shouted.The cat saw the mouse, then ran away and crawled under the bed."Rat!" Mithun ran after the cat shouting.
"I will chase away that rat," said the mother boldly.He took a broom and stabbed here and there."You're a rat," Dad shouted. Mom saw the rat and he too hid under the cot.
"I know how to get rid of this rat!" Grandma jumped down from the sofa. He rolled up a newspaper and stabbed it here and there.
"Rat!" Said Dad. He climbed a little further up the window."Left with you!"Grandma looked at the mouse. He too ran and hid under the bed.
"Damn!" Said Dad. He could not climb above it.Slowly descended from the window. He hid under the bed without catching the mouse's eye!
“Rat! Rat! ” That everyone shouted together.Papa woke up to that noise.She sat up in bed and rubbed her eyes gently.Um, of course, yes, I know this, why it's something known in advance.
It had two eyes, four legs, and a long tail."Rat!" Papa clapped his hands happily.Papa looked at the rat and the rat started to run. Papa also ran backwards!
Climb on the sofa, jump out the window, jump on the table, roll on the pillows ...
... slipped between the curtains, stumbled on the plates, and ran out the door!

My name is Kobole. I live in a small village.
One day, I was out picking fruits. I saw something I had never seen before.
There were colourful lines in the sky.
I dropped all the fruit and ran to tell people at home.
People were standing outside surprised.
I said happily, "It is a beautiful sheet hanging from the sky." "No! I think someone is pouring paint from the sky," Neno said.
Some people agreed with me. Others thought Neno was right. We began to argue.
A man from a faraway village said, "You are all wrong."
We shouted, "Tell us then what it is if we are wrong."
The stranger said, "It is the rainbow. Have you never seen the rainbow before?"
We asked the stranger, "Rainbow? What is a r-a-i-n-b-o-w?"
Neno asked, "Is it ours? Can we keep it here?" We never got answers to our questions because the man had left.

There was a shepherd who had no grass to feed his pig, sheep and goat and no grains for his hen. He had no barn to keep them warm.
He decided to take them where they could get food and shelter.
The shepherd said, "I could sell them for a quarter each." But the man was negotiating for a lower price.
The man said, "I only want the goat." But the shepherd said, "These animals are friends. I want all of them to be together."
The shepherd sold the sheep, the goat and the pig for a quarter each. He gave the hen for free. He was sad as he headed home.
He realised they weren't just animals. They were also his friends. So he went back to return the money and take his friends home.
"They are mine now," the man said. "I won't give them back." But the shepherd kept begging.
"I realised they are not just animals but also my friends," said the shepherd. The man asked, "Why did you sell them in the first place?"
A neighbour heard the argument and said, "Make a barn, provide grass and grains. Then you can get your animals back."
The shepherd loved his animals. He gave back the money and took home his friends to a perfect barn and plenty of grass and grains.

There was only one bus in Ebei's village. It was big and blue. It was very noisy.
“Tomorrow we will go to town,” said Ebei's mother. “We will buy your school uniform.”
Ebei was very excited. They would travel in the big blue bus. He could not sleep that night.
When his mother came to wake him, Ebei was already dressed.
Ebei and his mother walked to the bus stop. They waited for the big blue bus. But the bus did not come.
Other people arrived at the bus stop. They complained because the bus was late. “Where is the bus?” they asked.
Ebei was worried. “We will not be able to go to town,” he thought. “I will not be able to get my uniform.”
Some people gave up and went home. Ebei cried. He did not want to go. “We will wait a bit longer,” said his mother.
Suddenly, they heard a noise. They saw dust in the air. The bus was coming!
But this bus was not blue. It was not big. It was red and small. The people did not want to get in this bus.
“Get in! Get in!” shouted the driver. “We are very late today,” he called.
Ebei and his mother got in first. Soon everyone else got in the small red bus.
Ebei looked out the window. He saw more people at the bus stop.
Even more people were running to catch the bus. But they were too late. The red bus was full. It left for town.
“Where is the big blue bus?” asked Ebei's mother. “It broke down,” replied the driver. “We are fixing it. It will come tomorrow.”
Ebei did not care about the colour of the bus. He did not care about the size. This bus was going to town!

Koria the Crow wished to be beautiful. She envied the parrot and the peacock.Koria loved the peacock’s colourful tail. Each time she spotted it, she couldn't pull her eyes away.
﻿One day, Koria was searching for food. A sweet aroma floated in the air. She tracked down the delicious smell. People of all ages were in the middle of a celebration. Some were eating curry goat and ugali*. Others were dancing.*Ugali : Kind of porridge in Africa
Koria stayed there and watched with fascination. She was especially interested in two girls. One had a kitenge wrapped on, and another wore a pair of shining earrings. ‘Ooh! Look at that pair of earrings," Koria thought to herself.  "They make this girl look even more beautiful."
Each time the girl danced, her earrings jangled, giving out a sweet tinkle. Koria wanted those earrings! She wished for them to fall off the girl's ears so she could pick them up.
Koria waited on a tree branch. All she wanted was to be more beautiful than the parrot and the peacock. All she needed were those earrings!Some people spotted Koria and tried to chase her away.
They thought she was after their food. Koria flew away in fear. She felt so sad.But she would not give up!
In the morning, Koria went to the market. She went to thejewellery seller and asked, "How much are your shiny earrings?"“How will you pay me? You’re a crow!” said the seller,swatting Koria away.
Koria thought of another solution.‘I’ll visit the jewellery maker. He will help me become beautiful."Koria said, “Mr. Jeweller, I have an offer to make. I’ll go outand collect silver and copper items, then bring them to you.You’ll get a lot of material to make jewellery. In exchange,you’ll give me just one pair of earrings. What do you say, is ita deal?”The jeweller agreed.
Koria worked hard and collected many silver and copper scraps from every place she could think of. She was now tired and hungry.‘Mmmmm… A sweet aroma! Let me search for that cannedmeat."
Koria found the meat and had her fill. Energized, she flew back to the jeweller’s, carrying her items. But his office was locked! “Aagh! Has the jeweller left?” She panicked.
She stared at the padlock for a long time. Her joy at the prospect of being beautiful evaporated. She was close to tears.The parrot sitting on a nearby tree branch saw Koria and came down to meet her.
“What’s wrong, Koria?”“I had the chance to be beautiful. But I stopped to eat instead of coming back here quickly. Now it’s too late!”
The next day, Koria reached the jeweller’s early in the morning.
When he finally arrived, he took the bag of copper and silver from Koria. He said nothing as he started working with them. Soon, he had made beautiful earrings from the scraps.He handed the earrings to Koria.Koria was overjoyed thinking of how beautiful she would soon be!
She asked the jeweller to help her put them on.“You must first get your ears pierced,” he answered.Koria could not imagine who to ask. Finally, she decided to go to the parrot and the peacock for help. "Beautiful birds might know where to find a beauty shop," she thought to herself.
“No, we do not know where you can pierce your ears. They’re too small,” said the peacock and the parrot.Koria didn’t believe them. She flew away angrily to seek someone else’s help. “I must get my ears pierced. If only I could do it on my own!”Koria flapped her wings and flew to the village.
There, she went looking for one of the girls she saw at thecelebration. She spotted one and called out to her.“Kroo! Kroo! Kroo!”The girl did not understand her and chased her away.
Koria was chased away wherever she went. Soon, she was exhausted and starving. “It’s afternoon. I must search for food. I need to be strong if I have to find someone to help me. I WILL be beautiful. No one can stop me.”﻿She flew and flew until it was dusk.
Then she noticed something else.“My feathers are shining on my right side,” she said. Then she flew in another direction. “My feathers are shining on my left side!"
"I can shine without my earrings!" Koria realized. "My feathers are BEAUTIFUL!"
Koria smiled and decided to go find a delicious dinner.“Koria!” a voice called out. It was the peacock.“Your earrings are beautiful.”“Thank you, peacock," Koria answered. "But look at my shiny feathers. Aren't they even lovelier?”
Blue skies and calm waters — a perfect day for diving! We setout in a little boat, hoping for a BIG adventure!
When we reached the dive site, we carefully checked all ourequipment and put on our fins and masks.
As soon as we were underwater, we were greeted by a school ofyellowback fusiliers.
There were so many different creatures to see around this large table coral:  oriental sweetlips, parrotfish, batfish, and even abeautifully-patterned nudibranch.				To know more about the creatures marked out in bold lettering, turn to the back section of this book.
This trumpetfish changed colour to try and blend in with a schoolof yellow tang, but you can pick him out easily enough, can’t you?
It’s a good thing we kept a safe distance from this lionfish.The spines on his back can be quite poisonous!
These clownfish carefully guarded their sea anemone home, butfinally agreed to let me take a few pictures.
We saw a honeycomb moray eel having its teeth cleaned by cleanerwrasses, and another pair even offered to give us a scrub!
There were triggerfish and sea urchins. We even saw a coral grouper and a reef octopus playinghide-and-seek.
The octopus won the game. They’re masters of disguise. Pipefish are great at disguise too. Can you spot the two ghostpipefish in this picture?
We came across a couple of whitetip reef sharks resting near thebottom. They’re pretty harmless, so we swam in for a closer look.
We followed this hawksbill turtle for a while as he looked aroundthe reef for a nice sea sponge to lunch on.
As we made our way back to the boat, we were thrilled to see amanta ray ‘flying’ through the water with two remora fish in tow.
And just when we thought this dive couldn’t possibly get anybetter, we sighted a dugong grazing on some sea grass.
What an incredible experience! I can’t wait to go diving again!
Corals are both plants andanimals. Thousands of little algae live inside corals, and give themenergy to grow. They have hard outer skeletons and grow into manydifferent shapes.Plankton is the main source of food for many sea creatures. Theyare a mix of algae, bacteria, tiny animals, and the eggs and larvaeof larger animals that float about with the ocean currents.Feather stars may look like plants, but they’re really animals.They use their feather-like ‘arms’ to catch and eat bits offloating plankton.
Parrotfish have strong teeth that form a parrot-like beak, whichthey use to scrape algae off hard coral. Some species don’t mindeating bits of coral as well, and they later poop out a fine sandthat washes up on land to form beautiful white beaches. Clownfish and sea anemones live together and help each other. The clownfish help the anemones by cleaning their tentacles and luringother fish for the anemone to eat. The anemones, in turn, allow theclownfish to hide among their poisonous tentacles without stingingthem. Cleaner wrasses are small fish that keep bigger fish clean byfeeding on their parasites and dead skin. The bigger fish recognisethe wrasses by their colours and the dance-like way they move.
The reef octopus can hide by changing its colour and texture. Itmakes its home in holes in the reef, or buries  itself in the sand.Ghost pipefish can be found in pairs, floating with their headsdown and hidden among sea grass, corals or feather stars. Like thereef octopus, they can change colour to blend in perfectly.The whitetip reef shark has a thin body, broad head, and whitetips on its dorsal and tail fin. They hunt at night, and sleepthrough most of the day.
The hawksbill turtle has a flat body, a shell with jagged edges,and a sharp, curving mouth that looks like a hawk’s beak. Manta rays are huge fish with wing-like fins on the sides of theirbodies. These large fins help them swim gracefully through the water.On some manta rays, the distance from one wing tip to the other canreach up to 23 feet! The dugong is a vegetarian marine mammal. Its favourite food issea grass, which it is able to graze on with its  specially-shapedsnout. Dugongs are also called sea cows.
Once upon time they were a farmer who had three little sheep. the sheep liked the farmer and the farmer liked them. The farmer named the sheep he called them Rocky the big brother, Jeff second   and Anna third.

Anna said "don't tell me you are you scared" then Rocky replied "off course i'm scared that's Mr eater the one who tried to kill me when i was just a baby" Rocky was very scared that he faint Anna and Jeff lough at there big brother. Mr fox said what a surprised to see my meal is ready "oh oh"said Jeff and Anna then Anna said "who is your meal" Mr eater said "thanks (imaginary)mother for the three little sheep i will keep them safe  in my tummy.
Then Mr eater lough "hahahahahahahahahaha............! but Anna said "today is your end Mr eater" then Anna jumped and kicked Mr eater in the face Mr eater died and the two big brother cheered for there little sister Anna.     THE END.

Kadogo and Juma are friends who love running. They run together every day.
One day they were reading maps at school. Juma said, "Let's run across our continent. Let's race, together with Africans from many countries!" "Let's go, we can do it! African unity!" cheered Kadogo.
They decided to carry a unity torch on their journey. They lit the torch and began to run.The race started at the southern tip of our continent, in Cape Town, South Africa.
From South Africa they headed along the west coast. They ran through Namibia, Angola, DRC, Congo and Cameroon. Runners quickly joined them from these countries.The growing group of people rested in Nigeria, in Abuja.
More runners from West Africa joined the friends as they passed through Nigeria. They continued together, following the River Niger.
A sandstorm in Mali made it difficult to run. Juma was the strongest of all of them. He led the way safely, holding the unity torch high.
At Guinea's coast in Conakry the dusty runners washed in the sea. Then they decided to race to Morocco through Senegal and Mauritania.All the way, more people joined them.
At Casablanca, the runners enjoyed playing on the beaches. They made more friends.Next, they set off across North Africa.
They ran through Algeria and Libya, and stopped in Egypt to visit the pyramids. Then they turned and headed east,  following the River Nile to East Africa.
They ran through deserts and national parks. More young people joined them in Kampala, Uganda. The group ran into Kenya, and headed for its coast and the city of Mombasa.
When they reached the sea, they sat on the beach and ate coconut rice with fish. Juma said, "Let's take the unity torch to Mount Kilimanjaro, in Tanzania."
But by this time, Juma was very tired. Just as they left Kenya, he fell down. The runners stopped the race. Everyone came to help Juma.
Juma passed on the torch to Kadogo. He said, "You can carry the torch to Mount Kilimanjaro. Let's light a flame for African unity."
After lighting a unity flame high on Kilimanjaro, the group of runners headed into southern Africa.People cheered the runners saying, "You are our heroes. We are together!"
They stopped to swim in Lake Malawi, and rest before going to the next country. Kadogo said to Juma, "We've run from farthest point in southern Africa to the farthest point in North Africa. Now we are in the south again. Our journey is ending."
The unity runners finally carried the torch to Great Zimbabwe, the ancient city of that country. Crowds gathered at this important place, cheering to welcome the tired runners."We did it!" said Kadogo. "What a race!" smiled Juma.
Fire,  Water,  Truth and Lies were friends.
But Lies was not happy and wanted to destroy their friendship.
One day Lies said,  "Why don't we all go and look for free land. Then each one of us can have a kingdom?" They agreed and started walking.
Lies went to Water and said,  "Fire is our worst enemy. She burns everything. We need to find a kingdom without her around."
Water said,  "What should we do?" Lies replied,  "Obviously we'll have to kill her. You are the only one with the power to do that. When she is sitting down,  splash on her and destroy her!"
Water said,  "If I do that I'll spill on the earth and won't be able to become one again." But Lies said,  "No problem,  I'll put some stones down,  so you won't spill away. I will collect you again." Lies put down stones to collect Water.
When the unsuspecting Fire sat down,  Water poured all over her. This way,  Lies got rid of Fire and they went on their way.
After some time,  Lies said to Water,  "Look,  why don't you sit at the top of this cliff to enjoy the scenery?"
When Water sat down,  Lies sneaked up and pulled the stones from under her. She spilled away,  and that was the end of her.
Now,  Lies had to get rid of Truth. When they came to a big mountain,  Lies told Truth to wait at the bottom of the mountain.
He pushed down a big stone to crush Truth.
When the stone crashed down,  diamonds and gold and all sorts of valuable things fell out. Truth managed to crawl out from the broken stone.
Lies came down to look at the body of Truth. Instead,  he saw all the valuable things. He asked,  "Where did these come from?"
Truth said,  "When the stone landed on me,  this is what came out." Lies wanted these valuable things too. He said,  "I'll go down to the bottom of the mountain. You go up and push down another big stone."
So,  Truth went up and pushed down a big stone.
The stone landed on Lies' head and crushed him to death.
In a village there was a disagreement among people of different occupations. Everyone thought their work was the most important!
The teacher said that he had the most important occupation. “Without teachers you could not go to school and learn.”
The builder said that he had the most important occupation. “Without builders you would not have schools to learn in or houses to sleep in.”
The carpenter said that he had the most important occupation. “Without carpenters you would have no furniture for your houses and schools.”
The doctor claimed that he had the most important occupation. “Without doctors and nurses you could get sick and die.”
The farmer said that she had the most important occupation. “Without farmers you would not have food to eat.”
The student argued that students had the most important work. “Without students, there would be no teachers, builders, doctors, farmers, or carpenters.”
Eventually everyone agreed that all the occupations are important. We need teachers, builders, doctors, farmers, and carpenters. But everyone has to be a student first!
“We have milk, eggs,bread  and vegetables in the fridge,” says Ma.“I’ll cook dinner!” says Pa.“Pa, can you make fried rice?” asks Tara. “Fried rice,” Madhav echoes.
As soon as Tara, Madhav, Ma and Pa enter the house, they know that something is wrong. Very wrong."Chee! What’s that smell?” cries Tara.“A MONSTER!” yells Madhav.
It is hot, dark and stinky. The whole house smells!Where is the smell coming from?
Ma opens the fridge. Everyone covers their noses and mouths.“Hmm, it’s warm inside and the light is off,” says Ma, sticking her arm into the fridge. “What happened?” asks Tara. "The fridge stopped working some time ago," Pa explains. "Without the cold air, everything spoiled,” says Ma, glumly.“Has the milk gone bad?” asks Tara.“Yes, can you smell how sour it is?” asks Ma.“Milk needs to be kept cold to stay fresh,” says Pa.
“Has the bread gone bad?” asks Tara.“Yes, do you see that green stuff? That’s mould,” says Pa, “It grows on the bread.”“Fuzzy,” says Madhav, curiously.“Don’t touch it,” says Pa. “You’ll fall sick if you eat it.”
“Have the vegetables gone bad too?” asks Tara, sadly.“Yes, they’re rotten,” says Ma. “We can’t eat them.”
Invisible MonstersTara and Madhav thought there was an invisible monster in their house. While there was no monster to be found, they were right about there being something invisible!When food goes ‘bad’—meaning it cannot be eaten by human beings—it’s because something invisible has begun to eat the food. These invisible beings are called microbes.Microbes aren’t totally invisible: they’re just very, very, very tiny (tinier than the tiniest insect you’ve ever seen). You need a machine called a microscope to be able to see them. They look something like this.
Once upon a time in a village, there lived a boy named Thabo.
Thabo was friends with a girl called Lerato. They were neighbours.
One day, they went to get water.
When they were near to the spring, they saw a cow lying there. They sat down and talked about how they could play with it.
Then Thabo started to imitate the cow. "Muuu, muuu, muuuuuuu!" he said in a clear, loud voice.
Until the cow turned to look at them. Suddenly, Lerato got a fright. Thabo realised that she was scared.
Thabo said, "Let's go to this cow and hit it. It will run away and then we can get water.""Thabo, I'm afraid!" said Lerato trembling.
Thabo went first. Lerato went slowly. They tried to hit the cow, but it didn't move.
Thabo said, "Lerato, you can stay here. I will fetch the water."Lerato agreed.
Thabo scooped the water into the first bucket.
Thabo shouted, "Joo, jooo, jooooo!"Lerato burst out laughing, she could not stop.
The cow said, "Mmuuu, mmuuu, muuuuuu!"
When at last Lerato stopped laughing, she ran home as quickly as she could. When she arrived, she found Ma Mathabo sweeping outside.
She said, "Ma Ma Ma, the co co cow has taken Thabo!" Lerato was panting.
Ma Mathabo dropped her broom and ran. What do you think happened next?
Akai had no shoes. Other children her age     had shoes.
"It is difficult to play without shoes," said Akai  to her mother.
"Akai,  I think it is time for you to have shoes," said mother. .
Mother woke up Akai   early the next morning.   .
Akai and her mother went to the market. .
They went into a shoe shop. Mother bought shoes for Akai.
At night,  Akai thought about her new shoes. .
Akai put on her new shoes. .
Akai thought about how she would show off her shoes. .
Akai wore her new shoes again. She danced around the room.
"Akai,  you must not wear shoes in bed," said mother. .
Akai was so happy to have shoes for the first time.
Tarik was a Grade 4 student at Elementary School. His school was in Menz district in the province of North Shoa, Ethiopia.
Tarik had a dog called Buchie. Where Buchie was, Tarik was there too. When Tarik's mom gave Tarik food, he shared it with Buchie.
Tarik and Bedilu were in the same class. They were shepherds when they were not at school. One Saturday morning, Tarik and Bedilu were taking their flock to the common grazing land.
They also carried their school books to study for examinations. Bedilu said, “Let's play kisara for few minutes to relax our minds.” Tarik replied, “No, we should start studying!”
“We will study soon. Please play!” Bedilu begged. In the end, the boys played kisara. (Kisara is a game where players take turns throwing flat stones or coins into a small hole, standing about a meter away.)
Without noticing, they played the game for about two hours. When they looked, they couldn't see their sheep anywhere. They ran everywhere searching for the sheep.
From a distance, they saw a wolf chasing their sheep! Then they saw that the wolf had killed Tarik's sheep. He began crying. He knew that his father would punish him severely.
When Bedilu took his sheep home, Tarik didn't go home. He decided to spend the night in the big tree not far from his house. He slept on a low branch and Buchie slept below him on the ground.
At midnight, Tarik was woken by a loud scream of hyenas. He got such a fright that he fell off the branch, down to the ground.
Tarik heard sounds of animals near him but it was too dark to see them. He began sweating, thinking that it must be hyenas.
Suddenly, lightning flashed light across the sky. Tarik was able to see around him. There was Buchie standing guard and protecting him from two snarling hyenas.
Buchie saved Tarik, what a friend he was indeed! The boy scrambled back up into the tree, taking Buchie with him. Together they would wait for morning and then go home to face Tarik's father.
There lived a set of twin brothers called Elephant and Hippo. One day, Fate came and gave them two choices. "Choose blindness or leprosy," Fate ordered. Hippo wanted to be clever. He quickly chose leprosy so as to keep using his eyes. Elephant chose blindness.
Hippo became an angry boy because of the leprosy. Blindness gave Elephant patience. Elephant needed help but Hippo treated him badly. Then Elephant found a magical Stick, which helped him to move around. They whispered secrets to each other. Stick helped Elephant to fight enemies.
Because Hippo lost his fingers and toes he also needed help. Elephant was kind to him. When food was served, Hippo needed Elephant to cut the food and place it on his fingerless palms. Hippo was very unhappy.
One morning, their mother served hot yams. Because they were hungry, the boys did not wait for the yams to cool.Hippo put his palms together and they looked like a plate. He asked, "Put my share here for me."
The yam was so hot that it burned their palms. Hippo moved his hands up and down, to cool his palms. The yam fell on the sand.Elephant moved his own yam from one hand to the other without it falling. Hippo was annoyed.
"Help me pick up my yam, please," Hippo asked Elephant. "You know I cannot see it," Elephant replied."Give me your hand, I will show you," Hippo said.Elephant found the yam, and blew the sand off it. He gave it to Hippo.
In the evening, their mother gave them pounded yam, and four pieces of meat. Elephant quickly touched the meat and counted the pieces with his fingers. Hippo did not notice Elephant counting the meat.
Hippo tried to steal a piece of meat but he dropped it. When it was time to share the meat, Elephant asked, "Were there not four pieces of meat?" "There were three," Hippo lied. "There were four," Elephant insisted. "Are you really blind?" Hippo asked.
One day, they were hungry but their mother was away. "Let us go and play to forget our hunger," suggested Hippo. Elephant agreed, so Hippo said, "Let us swim in the river." He knew Elephant could not swim. He planned to kill his brother!Elephant and Stick followed Hippo.
On the way, Hippo went into the forest. He picked up a heavy stone and put it under his arm. He grunted as he picked up the stone. He was still grunting as they walked to the river. "Why is he grunting like that?" Elephant asked Stick.
When they reached the river, Hippo said, "I will jump in first and help you to swim." He moved away from Elephant. He lifted the stone and threw it into the river. "That sound is too small for the size of Hippo," Stick whispered in Elephant's ear.
Elephant asked Stick to find out more. He started swinging Stick round and round. Stick hit Hippo very hard. "Ayei!" Hippo cried and jumped into the river. The magical Stick turned Hippo into a water animal. He turned Elephant into a land animal and became Elephant's trunk.

When the last school bell rang, all the children laughed and screamed with joy.                                                    All, except Akku. Akku was ANGRY!
"Akku! Akku! Look at the pretty sunflowers!" said Appa, as they rode   through a field."Oh no! They’re TOO YELLOW! They’re making my eyes hurt!" said Akku.
Akku! Akku! Look! Look at all the monkeys!" said Appa, pointing at the roof of their house.                              "oh no!" said Akku. Go AWAY!
"Here, drink some buttermilk," said Appa. "It’ll cool you down.""NO!" said Akku. "I DON’T WANT ANY!""Try a sip, at least?""OKAY! FINE!" said Akku, and tried a sip.It wasn’t all that bad.She had another sip.  And another.In no time, the glass was empty.
"Would you like a vada?" asked Appa.  "NO" said Akku."Just one little bite?""Okay, FINE!" said Akku, and took a bite. It  was quite good.She took another bite.And another.In no time, the plate was empty.
"Good girl," said Appa. "Now will you tell me why you’re so angry?"    "NO!" said Akku."Was it something I did?""NO!""Was it something Amma did?""NO!""Did something happened in school today?"     "MAYBE!"        "Oho."
"Would you like to draw it?" asked Appa. "Here’s a nice sheet of paper and some crayons."                                                                                                                                     "Okay, FINE!" said Akku.
Akku drew a brick… "This is the BRICK that I tripped over this morning," said Akku.                   "You’re right. That is a  brick!" said Appa.
And Akku drew a boy…"This is Bikku, The BOY who laughed at me when I fell down!" said Akku.                 "You’re right," said Appa. "He shouldn’t have laughed at you."
And Akku drew an idli…    "This is my idli," said Akku. "It fell out of my lunch box when I tripped over the BRICK!"
And Akku drew a crow…                                              "This is the CROW that flew off with my idli," said Akku.                              "The crow must have been very hungry," said Appa.
And Akku drew her teacher…"This is my teacher, Amala Miss," said Akku."She helped me up when I fell down. And then she hugged me.""That’s nice of her," said Appa."And then she patted my back and said, you would be fine. I DON’T like to be hugged and patted."Are you alright now?" I’m okay now."     "That’s good."
"See how well you draw, Akku?" said Appa."You’re a real artist! Will you draw something for Amma too?""Okay!" said Akku, and      started drawing some more. "This is a little white mouse… and this is a boat…and this is a coconut tree…"
"And this is a sunflower…and this is your cycle, Appa… and this is a dog…and this is a frog…"In no time, Akku had forgotten all about the BRICK that made her trip and fall. And about the BOY who laughed at her. And about the IDLI-CROW.And Akku even forgot about being ANGRY.
10 Things to Do If You Feel ANGRY like Akku:1. Laugh loudly and jump around with your arms in the air!2. Slowly – very, very slowly – breathe in, and breathe out!3. Drink some water! Or buttermilk!4. Eat a piece of fruit! Or a vada!5. Tell a grown-up about how you’re feeling!6. Write about how you’re feeling!7. Draw it out! Paint it!8. Play with a pile of clay!9. Make up a song about your anger! Sing it aloud!10. Do the happy dance!

I wake up at night feeling thirsty. I want to get some water. I start looking for my slippers under the bed.
Oh my God! There is a tiger under my bed.
Now what should I do?
Should I call Ma? What if the tiger roars?
Should I just go back to sleep? But I am not sleepy any more.
Then someone turns on the light. Ma is standing at the door.
“What happened dear?Did you call me?” asks Ma.
I point towards the tiger. Ma bends and pulls the tiger out from under the bed!
Hey, this is no tiger. This is my thick yellow and black sweater. Its buttons shine like a tiger's eyes.
I got scared for nothing!Ma gets me some water.
Now I will sleep. And dream about real tigers in a jungle!
Once upon a time, there was a rooster and a hare. They were good friends.
One night, Hare visited Rooster and his family. They enjoyed supper together.
When it was bedtime, Rooster and his family soon fell asleep. Hare could not see their heads.
Rooster and his family slept very well. Hare was not able to sleep the whole night.
In the morning, Hare wanted to know Rooster's secret. "Where do you put your heads at night?" he asked.
Rooster decided to play a joke on Hare. He said, "At bedtime, we chop off our heads. Without heads, we sleep very well."
"Then in the morning, we put our heads back on," explained Rooster.
Hare went home and told his family about the rooster's secret. The Hare family decided to try it themselves. What do you think happened?
Let me tell you about the palm tree.
This tree lives when everything else is dry.
The shade from a palm tree is always cool.
We eat fruit from the palm tree.
We use palm leaves to thatch our houses.
We make brooms and mats from palm leaves.
We use palm tree seeds for fuel.
Do you see why the palm tree is important?
It's not easy being a tiger.Yes, tigers are beautiful and fierce.
But tigers are also big and heavy.This makes it difficult for them to hunt for food.
Out of every twenty times a tiger hunts,it eats only once.
When a tiger moves through the forest,KHAU! KHAU! KHAK!The langur calls, just like an old man coughing!KHAU! KHAU! KHAK!
AWOOOO! HAWOOOO!The barking deer calls, like a scared dog!AWOOOO! HAWOOOO!
OOW! OOW! OOW!The spotted deer calls, like a little bird!OOW! OOW! OOW!
The whole forest knows the tiger is here!AHUUUN? AHUUUN?The tiger wonders, where has everyone gone?

This is my brother.
This is my sister.
This is my grandmother.
This is my grandfather.
This is my uncle.
This is my aunt.

Once upon a time, there was a man who had three sons. The youngest son was the cleverest and his father liked him the most. Then the man realised that his two other sons were jealous. So when the father died, he left all his cattle to his two elder sons. He only left one ox for the youngest son. But the brothers were still jealous of him.
One day they said, “We've got to slaughter your ox.” He was the youngest so he couldn't protest. He said, “If that must be so, there's nothing I can do. But please give me the hide.” When they slaughtered the ox, he took the hide. After drying it, he climbed a tree with it.
As it got darker, a group of merchants came to sleep under the tree. In the middle of the night, the young man started beating the hide with a stick. When the stick hit the hide it sounded like thunder. The merchants thought that a storm was coming. They ran off leaving their goods behind.
The young man picked up the goods and took them home to his brothers. They asked, “Where did you get all these things?” He said, “The price of hides is so expensive that I got all this for my one hide.”
The brothers quickly slaughtered their cattle. They went to the market and called, “Hides for sale! Hides for sale!” The people at the market said, “We don't want your hides!” They were very angry and said to their brother, “You fooled us, so as a punishment, we're going to burn your hut.”
The smart brother said, “There's nothing I can do, but please give methe ashes.” They burnt his hut. He took the ashes in a bag and went away to a rich man's hut. The rich man gave him permission to sleep in his hut. When he was going to eat, he said to the rich man, “Look after this bag, it has got a lot of valuables.”
In the morning he started shouting. The rich man went to ask him what was wrong. “Someone has taken all my valuables and replaced them with ashes!” moaned the young man. The rich man didn't want his reputation to be ruined. So he said, “I'll fill it up with anything you want.” He filled it with wheat, teff and all sorts of seeds.
The brother went home and said, “Look, ashes have become very expensive. See what I managed to buy from selling those ashes.” The brothers went and burnt their huts as well. They took the ashes to the market and shouted, “Ashes for sale! Ashes for sale!” Everybody said, “How stupid you are, who'll buy ashes?”
The brothers were very angry and decided to kill their younger brother. They tied him up and put him in a basket so that they could throw him over a cliff. While they were carrying the basket to the cliff, they met an old man. He said to them, “My cattle have run away, will you bring them back for me?” The brothers put down the basket and ran off.
The young man called from inside the basket to the old man. He asked, “What's wrong with you?” The young man replied, “They want me to become a king but I don't want to be one.” The old man said, “If I get into the basket will I become king?” And the young man answered, “Yes.”
The old man let the young man out of the basket and he got inside. After the brothers returned with the cattle, they picked up the basket and threw it over the cliff. The young brother took the old man's cattle back to his hut. His brothers were amazed that he was still alive, but all they said was, “Where did you get these cattle?”
He said, “There are many cattle at the bottom of the cliffs. If you jump off the cliffs in baskets, you will find some too.” The older brothers got into baskets. The clever brother threw the baskets over the cliffs. He lived happily ever after.
My imagination is like a key that opens every door!
In my imagination, my umbrella has two handles so I can hold it with my sister.
In my imagination, there are superhero bees.
Super bees, who fly around in water just as easily...
...as they can fly in the air!
In my imagination, flowers grow in boots and sing.
In my imagination, every child has ice cream for supper...
...and then falls asleep as flowers sing to a purple moon.
In a far away town, there was a smart and expensive shoe shop. This is the town in which I was born.
Many people came to this shoe shop, but few could afford to buy the fancy footwear. One day, a rich man with big feet visited the shop.
He put his money on the shop counter. Then, with his hands in his pockets, he walked up and down looking at the shoes.
As he came closer, I held my breath and froze.He stretched out his hands and grabbed me.He sat down and put me on his feet.
He had huge feet, and the smell nearly suffocated me! I was packed into a box.We drove home, and he put me in a cupboard.
He wore me every day.I made him smart and he walked with confidence. I had a hard life. He was always lazy about washing his feet.
In return, sometimes I pinched him, making him limp.Eventually, I became old and broken, with scars and cracks.He put me outside, next to the rubbish bin.
Someone picked me up for recycling, and took me to a leather workshop.At the workshop I was made into a shiny new wallet!I began a new life.
Long ago in a town called Sunland lived a girl with very long legs. Aku was her name.
Aku wondered about a lot of things.Sometimes Aku's father, Ataa Ankra, a fisherman let her go to the river with him to fish in his canoe. While Aku fished with her father, she wondered why the sun always looked at her from the sky.Sometimes Aku helped her mother, A'anua to cook. Aku wondered why palm oil looked red in calabash but yellow in yam pottage.
And Aku wondered why Oti, her brother, and the other boys would not let her play football with them. Once, Aku asked the boys why. They only laughed and told her to go and play with the girls.The girls too would not play with Aku. "Your legs are too long," they always said.Aku was left lonely. She had no one to share her many thoughts with.
But Aku soon became friends with the sun.She looked forward to seeing the sun every morning when she woke up. The cocks crowed to announce sunrise. Aku loved to dance in the early morning sun, her shadow dancing with her. The tweeting of birds made the cock crow music sweeter.The sun filled Aku with happiness. The sun made Aku smile a lot.
But one day, the sun did not rise. Aku waited for the cocks to crow. They did not. The birds too did not tweet.And without the sun in Sunland, people could not go about their daily activities. Farmers could not go to tend their crops. And the sky was grey and sad. Ataa Ankra could not go fishing. Children too could not prepare for school. And women could not go to the market to haggle over the prices of soap and kerosene.Aku missed all these. She missed the cock crows and bird tweets too. And she missed the sunrise more.
Everyone wanted to know where the sun went. "Maybe the sun is dead," some people said. "The sun has travelled," said others.Aku disagreed, "No, the sun is not dead. And the sun has not travelled. Or it would have first told me."Some people chuckled at what Aku said. She continued anyway, "I tell the truth. The sun is my friend. The sun is not dead. It is only –". But no one would hear anymore. Everyone forgot about the sun. They laughed hard at Aku. The children laughed too.The children's laughter pained Aku the most.
Sad like the sky, Aku hastened into her house.On the way, she accidentally kicked her brother's football. The ball rolled into the kitchen. There was a calabash of palm oil in a corner of the kitchen. The ball hit the calabash. The calabash toppled.The palm oil in it spilled. The palm oil soiled the ball.
Oti came into the house with one of his friends to fetch his ball. He saw the toppled calabash, the spilled palm oil. He saw his soiled ball too.Before he could run out to tell A'nua what Aku had done, Aku picked up the ball and ran off. The boys followed Aku. They all met A'anua outside the house. A'anua saw Aku holding the ball. Before she could call Aku and scold her, Aku ran past her.Oti, A'anua and all the people of Sunland watched Aku run away. They wondered what she would do with a soiled ball.
Aku stopped when she got to the middle of the town square. She put the ball on the ground.With a mighty swing of her hands and a swift pull of one long leg behind the other, Aku kicked the ball. The ball turned round on the ground, spinning towards the edge of the town square. It hit the roots of the palm tree at one end of the town square.
Then the ball shot into the sad sky. With mouths opened wide, the people of Sunland gazed after the flying ball. The ball flew beyond the clouds, beyond the gaze of the eyes.Everything was still. All was quiet.Suddenly, the sky cleared. The clouds became white, round and fluffy. Then a big ball came from behind the clouds. The ball was bright. And it was red and yellow like palm oil. The ball was the sun. Aku's sun.Everything stirred. The quietness left.
Soon, everyone was rushing home to prepare for their daily activities. Ataa Ankra looked for his fish bucket.Farmers took their hoes. Children bathed and dressed, ready to go to school. Women tied monies at the ends of their cover cloths. They carried their basins and baskets and hurried to the market.
The sun returned to Sunland. Aku made it. A new day began...
I can run withit.
I can jump withit.
I can dance withit.
I can swim withit.
I can skip withit.
I can kick withit.
I can escape withit.
But I can neverfly with it.
When mother was younger,  we visited her friends.
She took me to the market to buy vegetables.
She took my brother to town.
She taught me the names of plants.
When mother grew older,  her back bent.
She stayed home more and talked to our neighbour's children.
She fell sick more often.
She walked with difficulty.
Her grandchildren went to visit her during holiday time.
Neighbours brought her milk from the shop.
When mother was younger,  she was stronger.
Now,  mother is older,  she is weaker.
Long ago, there were two friends, Mouth and Hand. They lived like brothers in one village each with his wife.
Afterwards, Mouth lost his wife.He borrowed from his friend, Hand, what he needed to bury her.
When Mouth returned home, he discovered that  Hand's machete was missing. He went to Hand to explain and to ask for forgiveness. Hand did not listen to his explanation. He wanted Mouth to return the exact machete he had borrowed from him.
Mouth did not know what to do. He decided to return to the grave to see if he had forgotten the machete there. He checked everywhere, but did not find it.In the end, he decided to dig up the grave. He was surprised when he did not find his wife's body in the grave.
Sad and worried, Mouth returned home. When he was near, he saw a dog carrying the machete he was looking for. He also heard his wife's voice saying, "This is your Helper."Mouth took the machete and returned it to Hand. He stayed with the dog.
The dog lived with Mouth hunting for him. One day, Mouth stopped calling him 'dog' and instead called him 'Helper'.They lived happily for a long time until friendship between Mouth and Hand was restored.
Later, Hand wanted to eat meat, but he did not have a hunting dog to help him. He went to his friend Mouth to ask for his dog.Mouth did not hesitate to give him Helper. He warned Hand not call him dog, but Helper.
Hand went with Helper everywhere he wanted. Everything he wanted done, Helper did it.He sent Helper to the forest to hunt. Hand was very happy with Helper's work.
One day when they were in the forest, Helper got lost. Hand called him, "Helper! Helper! Where are you?"He got tired calling and angrily, he said, "This dog is so stupid." At that moment, Helper appeared and said, "You called me, dog! I'm going away." And left.
Hand returned home without Helper. He went to his friend Mouth to inform him that Helper was lost. Mouth was not happy. He told Hand to bring his Helper back but Hand was unable to do so.Since that day, hand has been mouth's helper.
A poor farmer had an old ox that didn't like to work. The ox didn't want to plough the farmer's field. He wanted to stay at home and eat grass, drink water and rest.
The farmer had a donkey, too. The donkey and the ox were friends. At the end of the day, the ox and the donkey talked to each other. “I'm so tired,” the ox said. “I worked hard all day. The plough is big and heavy. The farmer never lets me rest.”
The donkey thought, “The ox is lazy. He doesn't like to work.” He cried, “Do you think your plough is heavy? Believe me, my friend, it is light! I carried a sack of grain on my back today. It was heavier than your plough, I am sure.”
The next day, the two animals met again. “I had a bad day today,” the ox said. “My master's field is far away, and it was full of stones. I worked hard all day. I didn't have any rest.”
“You worked hard?” asked the donkey. “Today I travelled many kilometres to the market in the town. I'm sure I worked harder than you.”
The next day, the ox came home late again. “Oh, my friend,” he said to the donkey. “Today was a very bad day for me.” But the donkey didn't want to listen to the ox any more.
He said, “You're always tired. When the farmer comes, lie down and say, 'Moo! Moo!' He will think that you are ill. He will let you rest.” The ox liked the donkey's idea. “Thank you, dear donkey, that's a very good idea,” he said.
The next morning, the ox lay down and closed his eyes. “Moo! Moo!” he said. The farmer looked at him. “My poor old ox is sick,” he said.“ But I must plough my field. Who will help me? Perhaps the donkey! He can pull the plough today.”
The farmer tied the plough to the donkey, and began to hit him with his whip. “Go on! Faster! Pull!” he called out to the donkey. The donkey worked hard all day, and in the evening he was very tired.
The donkey slowly walked home. The ox said, “Dear donkey, I had a lovely day today. I ate some grass, drank some water and I rested. I want to rest again tomorrow. Give me another idea.”
The donkey thought, “His work is much worse than mine. I don't want to do it again tomorrow.” The donkey said, “Be careful. The farmer said 'My ox is always tired and now he is sick. If he is not better tomorrow, I will kill him, and we can eat the meat.'”
The ox was very frightened. He cried, “Really? Did he say that? Then I will work tomorrow. I feel quite better now. I'm not tired at all!”
Once upon a time, there was a boy called Jallo. Jallo was very disobedient to his parents. People knew that this child behaved badly.
One day Jallo and his mother went to visit their relatives in the village.Before they left to return home, their relatives gave them a gift.
They took Jallo and his mother to the village's fruit trees, and invited them to take all the fruit that they liked.Except from the mango tree.
In the garden, Jallo saw a very big mango tree with many ripe mangoes.
Jallo was amazed to see so many ripe mangoes. He decided to pick one.
Although Jallo had been asked not to eat from the mango tree, he did not listen.He said, "Whatever happens, let it happen, I want to eat this mango."
Jallo's mother warned him again. But he refused to obey her.
On eating the mango, his stomach suddenly started rumbling.
Jallo felt unwell. He started crying. His head started to swell.
Then, a mango tree grew out of his head! Jallo became a mango tree.
Since that time, whenever someone touches the branches of that mango tree, it sings a song.The tree sings, "Whoever doesn't obey the elders, will regret. I made Jallo an example."
There was a rich cunning man called Madola. He hired people who worked hard but he did not pay them their wages.
Dande was 11 years old. He went to Madola for work so he could buy medicine for his grandmother. Madola hired Dande to graze his animals.
At the end of the month,  Dande went for his pay. The cunning Madola said,  "Go home and come back tomorrow for your pay."
Dande arrived early at Madola's home expecting to be paid. Madola said,  "Why! Are you a student? Why so early? Is this a school?"
Madola took Dande away from other workers. He said,  "I will pay you only if you bring me a gourd of honey."
Dande thought,  "I need the money for grandmother's medicine." He ran to the forest and placed two gourds beneath a bee-hive to fill up.
While Dande wondered how to punish Madola,  a small black poisonous snake entered one of the gourds unnoticed. Afterwards,  Dande sealed the gourds and left.
Dande gave Madola one gourd expecting his pay. After tasting,  Madola said,  "Bring me another gourd and I will pay you." Dande ran for it.
Dande brought the second gourd. He gave it to Madola saying,  "Here is another gourd of sweet honey like the last one. Pay me now."
Madola took the gourd but said in a cunning way,  "There is no pay today. Wait for the end of the year." Dande was angry.
Madola wanted to eat the honey. He put his finger in the gourd and was bitten. He cried,  "I'm bitten! Help!" The snake disappeared unnoticed.
All the workers ran away not knowing what had happened to their employer. A short while later,  an ambulance arrived to take Madola to hospital.

I am Ndela Pittins I grew up  at  a small  village  in South Africa .We live in a simple home raised by our loving mother.I have a playful  little brother called Eden
Growing up,it had always been mom, Eden and I . We had lost our father some years back . But we were always happy.Our mother did her best to give us a good life .
After  dad died , my mum took care of everything.She worked very hard  day and night .She is my Queen , role model and  my  best friend . When ever i needed advise i would talk to my mum .She gave the best advice ever.Not to forget her fingerlicking food she  cooked  that made me crave for more.My mother  is an enterpreneur, who owns her restaurant called La Amore .La Amore was small but very famous in the village , hopefully someday it will be very famous in South Africa.That's her biggest dream.
While growing up in South Africa , i had many friends from different races .Yet we always joyfully played together .Priya was Indian, Robert  was European, Lee hadbeen Korean,Tiana mixed race and others were my race, black.That kind of black that shines .Like my colour. We are all unique in our own ways .That's the lovieliest feeling ever.
All that mattered and still matters is love.As children we were always happy and full of life.Children jumped here and there . Laughters   could be vividly heard  which made this a homely and peaceful place to live in .
Sometimes,I miss my father.Mum doesn't like  talking about him but i imagine us  together.I think she's more hurt than Eden and I .She just doesn't have any other choice but to be strong for the both of us .My parents loved each other .They had great memories together.
My mother says that a persons beauty is from the inside not just outside.She also encourages me and my brother to study hard , and work hard because there is nothing for free in life.We should also be careful of strangers , she insists .Education is important for all children of the world .It empowers us and helps in building a better future.
Inspired by her ,I wanted to fulfill my dream of becoming Miss South Africa . I  had to study hard very hard at  school.I  even took part in different pageants and beauty competitions .I  failed many times  over and over again.But my family hadbeen always very supportive of me.My brother , Eden would always cheer up for me on the front row alongside  my mom .This gave me hope to get back up again and again.
She encouraged me to take part in many beauty contests  . I failed many times and felt very disappointed in myself .But kept going until oneday  i reached top ten in the Regional competition of Miss Beauty contest , whereby i won first place at the end of the competition .I saw my mom's tears of joy and found myself crying .
Two years later, i  took part in the Miss World competition , whereby i was crowned Miss World for  South Africa   2012  in Paris, France.When my name hadbeen  called out loud and i , almost collapsed out of joy . That had been my moment  .My mom was so proud of me and Eden out of nowhere came to the stage and hugged me so tight which he got kicked for but i told everyone out loud  .''Excuse me , ladies and gentlemen that's my crazy brother .''And they all laughed out loud .My mom welcomed me happily when i returned home .And Eden came and gave me a hug .So proud of my  younger brother  who became a successful business man..
Hard work really pays off.I learned that beauty should be for impact .And i  am so proud of the woman i have become.In my village the stories of the brave Ndela are narrated every now and then .Every girl now now wants to be Miss beauty.I had made my mother so proud , hopefully father would be even more proud smiling in heaven.
But the real beauty is not in being beautiful .Kindness ,  love , humility ,unity , compassion , sympathy for each other , good manners , and hard work .That's the kind of beauty we all need for within us lies beauty.
I started a charity to help refugees in the world called ONE  WORLD hoping the world would be a better place for all humankind, full of beautiful people from within and never runs out of laughter, where peace and love always prevails no more wars , just the love  .Only love .
My mom finally expanded her restaurant all over South Africa.She owns ten branches now and has become successful.Eden is helping mum out and i do what i can. And she has  now moved in a bigger house .Well as for me , its my graduation day  .I am so excited for my MBA at The  university  of Cape Town.Hooray ! that's my story of a little girl who was encouraged to dream big.
Refiloe shooed her chickens out of the tent. "Run away you silly things." she said, "I don't want you to be eaten at Palesa's wedding!"
Refiloe's mother was very proud of her house, and wanted it to be perfect for the wedding. She cleaned and washed and scrubbed and scoured and polished everything in sight. When she had finished, there was not a single speck of dust anywhere. The chickens poked their heads inside the front door. "Out!" shouted Refiloe's mother, "out you scruffy things with your dirty feet and beaks!"
Refiloe put the first chicken into the bucket of water. It clucked at the top of its voice and flapped its wings like crazy. "Hold still you silly thing," Refiloe shouted, "this won't take long!" When Refiloe wiped the chicken's nose and eyes it suddenly went limp and flopped over the side of the bucket.
"This is no time to sleep," said Refiloe. She gave it a good shake to get all the water out. "If you are not going to wake up now, I'll have to put you somewhere to dry nicely," she said. She laid the chicken out on the grass to dry. The chicken lay completely still.
Refiloe washed each and every one of her chickens. Each and every one of them went limp and floppy before she was finished with it. She put all those eight chickens in a row on the grass to dry. Not one of them moved a single feather. "I'll leave them to sleep a little," Refiloe thought to herself, and off she went to check on the moroho.
Mme Ngwe and Mme Pedi were Refiloe's aunts. They did not like each other at all. The aunts had been preparing for months for Palesa's wedding, but they would not even think about riding together in the same taxi.
Mme Ngwe spotted Refiloe's chickens laid out to dry. "What a nice little snack for me to take home!" she said to herself. She took off her chale and carefully wrapped all those chickens up in it. Not a single chicken moved. "Perfect!" she smiled, "now I shall put them somewhere where Mme Pedi will not ever find them," and she put the bundle around the corner among the pumpkin vines.
The next day the sun rose in good time for the wedding. Refiloe was up first and went to see her chickens. She saw that they were no longer lying on the grass. "They must be nicely dry by now. I'm sure they have gone to look for their breakfast," she said.
It was only when the groom's father was halfway through his speech that things started to change on that roof.
The first chicken spread its wings and flew onto Mme Ngwe's bosom. Mme Pedi next to her started giggling. Another chicken flew up onto Mme Ngwe's new duku. The people at the next table tried not to laugh. The lady next to Mme Ngwe put her head down onto the table, "Ai, aai, aaaaii, he, he, heeeeeeee!" she cackled. All the other chickens decided to join the first two. You couldn't see Mme Ngwe for all those chickens!
The guests screamed with laughter. The men had to hold onto their bellies. The women rolled around in their chairs. The boys and girls were hanging onto each other. The grandmothers could hardly breathe for laughing. The grandfathers stamped their walking sticks. Then the two aunts looked at each other and started giggling. Mme Pedi opened her mouth wide with laughter. Mme Ngwe threw back her head and laughed until all her chins shook. Refiloe couldn't believe it!
All the guests agreed that it was the best wedding entertainment ever known in Malealea. "Oh you are so lucky!" Refiloe said to her chickens as she put them into their coop for the night, "Mme says that she will never put you in the supper pot." "But look how dirty you are again," she told them, "I think I'll have to give you another wash tomorrow!"

Fati was a little girl who ran like the wind.She loved to laugh, and always tried hard to do as she was told.
Today was Sports Day at school. Fati played football and  ran in three races.
After school, she walked home with her good friend Hawa.  Hawa said, "Fati, you are a fast runner!"
Fati arrived home and found her mother preparing food. She said, "Mother, good evening." Fati's mother replied, "Good evening. How are you?"
Fati said, "We had Sports Day at school today. I ran very fast.I am hot, tired and very hungry."
Mother laughed and said, "My dear little Fati, you were born with fast legs!""I will make okro soup and dinner will be ready soon."
Mother put some palm oil in a big cooking pot and put it on the fire. When the oil was hot, she added onions and garlic and stirred until they were soft. Then she put in pepper, tomatoes and some water. Finally, she added six pieces of steamed cow meat.
Mother said, "Fati, please help me to stir the soup." Fati said, "Yes, Mother."
Fati stirred the soup once. She said, "This soup smells delicious."
Fati stirred the soup twice. She said, "This soup smells really delicious."
Fati stirred the soup three times. She said, "This soup smells truly delicious!"
Fati looked at her mother. Mother was not looking her way. She was cutting green leaves for the soup.
Fati took one piece of meat from the pot and ate it. "Mmm," she said.
Again, Fati looked at her mother. Her mother was not looking her way. She was cutting eggs for the soup.
Fati quickly took a second piece of meat from the pot and ate it. "Mmm. Mmm," she said.
Once more, Fati looked at her mother. Her mother was not looking her way. She was cutting green okro for the soup.
Fati very quickly took a third piece of meat from the pot and ate that too. "Mmm. Mmm. Mmm!" said Fati.
Mother came to the fire with the green leaves, eggs and okro. Fati was still holding the big wooden spoon.
Mother smiled and said, "Thank you for helping to stir the soup, Fati." Fati did not know what to say.
Mother put the green leaves, eggs and okro in the soup.She took the spoon from Fati and started to stir the soup.
Mother looked into the pot. She could see the soup bubbling on the hot fire. Mother looked for the six pieces of meat in the pot. "One, two, three." Mother saw three pieces of meat and no more. Mother said nothing. Fati said nothing.
When Mother served the soup, Fati did not get any meat. Fati said, "Mother, I am sorry. I will not do that again." She never did. And that was the end of that.

Fana loves animals. She has a cat, two hens, a goat and a dove. She spends time with these animals, feeding them, and playing with them.
One day, Fana was playing in the school yard with her friends when she saw children throwing stones at doves. “Why are they hurting the doves?” She asked herself.
She stopped playing and ran towards the children throwing stones. At first her friends didn't understand what was happening, then theyfollowed her. “Stop throwing stones,” shouted Fana.
The other children ran away. Fana caught the two injured doves. She saw wounds on their wings. She decided to take the two doves home to look after them.
She fed the doves. In the evening she told her family what she saw and did during the day, and how she saved the doves.
In the morning Fana and her parents went to the clinic and got medicine for the doves. After a few days, the doves' wounds healed. Fana felt very happy.
Fana always tells her friends, “I love animals. Animals are useful to us and they are our friends. We must protect and preserve them.”
"I have a very big problem," cried Chief Short and Round.
"I have lost my spring horn," said Chief Short and Round.
"I will find your spring horn," said Little Jojo. "I will look at Tata Rectangle's house."
Little Jojo and Tata Rectangle looked everywhere but they could not find the spring horn.
"Go and see if Mama Triangle has the spring horn," said Tata Rectangle.
Little Jojo stopped at his house to pour a glass of cold water.
Jojo visited Dudu Diamond and asked if she would go with him.
"It’s not far but I will pack some food to take with," said Dudu.
Dudu and Jojo stopped to eat and rest at the bottom of the triangle mountain.
When they were half way up the mountain, they saw a strange spider web.
Jojo and Dudu arrived at Mama Triangle’s house.
"The chief did not leave his spring horn here," said Mama Triangle.
Mama Triangle knew where they could find the spring horn.
It was evening when they arrived at Chief Short and Round’s house.
Mama Triangle pointed at the chief. "You are wearing your spring horn on your head."
Chief Short and Round gave Little Jojo the spring horn to blow.  They were happy.

'Wov! What a lovely raincoat!' Mannu danced happily holding the shining red raincoat that his parents had bought for him.'Mamma, may I wear the raincoat now?' Manu asked his mother.Mamma said, 'No, my child. You can wear it when it rains. It should start raining soon. But as of now I don't see any signs of the rain.'
But, Monday was a bright sunny day, full of golden sunshine.Mannu looked out of the window every now and then and asked his mother,'Mamma, will it rain today?'Mamma  peeped out of the window and said, ' I don't think it will rain today. You cannot wear the raincoat today. People will laugh at you, if you do.'
On Tuesday also Mannu kept looking at the sky. And the raincoat was kept right next to him, ready to be used. But the sky was a nice blue and as bright as it was on Monday.Mannu was disappointed,'Mamma, when will I be able to use the raincoat?''There is just a single cloud in the sky today, and that too a white one. I don't think you will get a chance to wear the raincoat today.'Mamma said.
Wednesday again was a very hot sunny day.Mannu was getting worried, 'Mamma, why is it not raining yet?'He tried to put the raincoat on at home. But had to immediately take it off because he felt too hot in it.Mamma, in her eagerness to comfort him said, 'I think it will rain soon, probably by afternoon.'
On Thursday, there was the school picnic. Mannu was eager to show off the raincoat to his school buddies.'Mamma, shall I carry the raincoat to the picnic. What if it rains there?' Mannu asked.'Don't, my pet. It will not rain today. See those white clouds? And they are also so far away.' Mamma tried to comfort him.
And... at last  on Friday, the sky looked quite dark with black clouds. Mannu kept the raincoat ready at hand.'Mamma, it will rain today, right mamma?' Mannu asked excitedly. The peacock also seemed to think so and started dancing. The tortoise came out of it's hiding and looked up at the sky hoping perhaps to feel cooler after the hot summer.'I think so. Today the sky is full of black clouds.' Mamma smiled at Mannu's excitement and was happy for him.
On the Saturday morning there was a loud thunder.  And also lightening.'Mamma, it that not lightening? Now it will surely rain, right Mamma?' asked Manu.He ran out on the lawns and saw that a frog and a tortoise also had come out of their hiding.
And.. tip...tap...tip...tap... came down the raindrops!Mannu, loved the rains...raincoat or no raincoat.'Oh, it is raining; it is raining.' Thus shouting  Mannu ran out of the house and started  jumping and dancing in the rain. And he had the company of the frog who also seemed to be  waiting for the rains.
'Wait Mannu, wait.' Mamma ran after him with his raincoat in her hand. 'You forgot your raincoat!'But Mannu was very happy getting drenched in rains. The raincoat which he was holding close to himself all this time was all forgotten.
Once upon a time, there was a crocodile living at a river with her young ones.
The crocodile taught her young ones not to trust humans. This is because humans have brains.
One day a certain man crossed the river.
The man met the crocodile in the middle of the river and she attacked him.
Just as the crocodile was about to kill him, she remembered her father's words. He always told her that people have brains.
The man promised the crocodile that he could bring her human brains. So the crocodile released him.
The crocodile and her young ones are still waiting on the riverbank to receive those brains.
Crocodiles are angry to this day because they never received the brains that were promised to them.
Once upon a time, Pa Nase the spider felt very hungry. He decided to go in search of food. He visited his friend's place where he usually got help. But his friend was not at home.
Hungry Pa Nase thought of an idea for getting food. He remembered the store where the village women usually kept food.
He sneaked into the store and stole some fish and bananas.
On his way out, the little children noticed his unusual movements. They called on one of the women. The women rushed at Pa Nase.
With loaded pockets, Pa Nase was very afraid and wanted to run. The women caught him and decided to punish him.
"Let us grind him on the village stone," Yalol, one of the women suggested.
Pa Nase laughed out loud and said, "My grandfather lives in this rock. Grinding me on it is like sending me home. Thank you!" The women decided not to grind him.
"Let us throw him in the fire," said Yangbet. Again, Pa Nase laughed and said, "My grandmother, who loved me so much, is the owner of all fires. Throwing me into fire is like sending me home. Thank you!" The women felt disappointed.
"Let us fill a basket with fruit, put him inside and throw it into the river" Yabana suggested. At this, Pa Nase cried, "You have finally killed me!" The women were happy. They filled a basket with fruit, put him inside and threw it into the river.
Once in the middle of the river, Pa Nase celebrated. He took some fruit and ate as he laughed at the women.
The women felt tricked and tried to hook Pa Nase. But the fast flowing river did not allow them to catch him.
Pa Nase forgot that there was fishing net down the river. He was caught in the net and got trapped. Nobody came to help him.

Once upon a time,  a man and a woman had seven foolish sons. The boys lost the family cattle,  they broke the plough,  and everyone cheated them at the market.
Their mother prayed,  "Oh God,  why did you send me all these foolish children? Please,  send me one more son,  and let him be wise."
In time the woman gave birth to another boy. The child was tiny. "We'll call him Sinziro," his mother said.
Although Sinziro grew,  he remained very small. But he was also extremely clever. His mother and father loved him very much. His brothers were jealous. "Why do our parents love you more than us?" they asked Sinziro. "Look at yourself! You are the size of a rat."
An enemy lived near the family's house. One day,  Sinziro's brothers said to each other,  "We are hungry,  but our enemy has many fat cows and bulls. Let's go tonight and steal two of his bulls. We'll take our father's donkey to carry the meat home." They did not see Sinziro because he was behind his father's stool.
That night,  Sinziro's brothers took the donkey and went to their enemy's compound. They did not see Sinziro running after them.
When they reached their enemy's compound,  the gate was shut. The brothers could not get inside."I wish that Sinziro was here instead of at home," said one of the brothers. "He's clever. He could get into this compound." They did not see Sinziro because he was hiding.
"I'm not at home,  brothers. I'm here," Sinziro called. "And I know what to do. Stay here. I'll go inside the compound,  and open the door. I'll drive the bulls out to you." "But how can you go into the compound?" the third brother asked. "The door is locked."
Sinziro laughed and said,  "Look,  there's a door for me. "His brothers looked. There was a small space in the gate. It was only big enough for a cat,  but it was big enough for Sinziro.
Sinziro ran through it easily. He climbed up to the door and opened it. Then he began to drive two fat bulls out of the compound. "Go on,  my beautiful bulls! Go out!" he shouted.
The brothers' enemy was asleep in his house,  but his dogs were awake. They heard Sinziro,  and began to bark. Their master woke up too. "What's going on?" he called.
The man came out of his house. Sinziro quickly hid so that the man could not see him. Then he pretended to be the man's servant. "Don't worry,  sir,  our two big bulls were lost,  but I am bringing them back now," he said. The owner was angry. "Don't make so much noise," he said. "We are trying to sleep." He went back into his house,  and shut the door.
Quietly,  Sinziro drove the two bulls out of the compound. His brothers were very happy. "What beautiful fat bulls!" they said. "Let's kill them and eat them now." "No!" said Sinziro. "Our enemy will hear us. He will come out again and catch us. We must take the bulls far away,  across the river."
Sinziro and his brothers drove the bulls away from the enemy's house. When they came to the river,  the seven foolish brothers looked at the water and shook their heads. "We can't cross this river," they said to each other. "Perhaps it's deep. We can't swim. Where is Sinziro? He will know how to cross it."
Sinziro was sitting on one of the bulls' horns. "I am here,  brothers," he said. "I know what to do. Give me a rope." His brothers gave him a rope. Sinziro tied one end of the rope to the tree. Then he swam across the river,  and tied the other end to another tree. He called out to his brothers,  "Hold the rope,  and walk across the river. You will be safe."
So,  one by one,  his brothers held the rope and crossed the river,  while the bulls swam in front of them. "We are far away from our enemy now," said Sinziro. "We can kill the bulls." The brothers killed the bulls. They divided the meat into seven parts for each of them.
"Where's my share?" Sinziro asked. The brothers laughed. "Your share?" they said. "But you are too small. You can't eat this meat. No,  Sinziro,  there's no meat for you." Sinziro was very angry. "I'll punish my brothers for this," he thought. Then he said to them,  "If you won't give me any meat,  at least give me the bladder of one of the bulls."
His brothers threw the bladder to Sinziro and got ready to leave. He took the bladder,  and ran ahead of his brothers. He climbed a tree near where they would pass. Sinziro tied up the bladder on one side,  and blew into it until it was like a ball. Then he took a stick and he began to beat the bladder.
As he was making a noise with the stick and bladder,  Sinziro shouted,  "Please,  don't beat me,  sir! I didn't steal your bulls. It was my brothers. Look,  they are coming. They have killed your bulls and cut up the meat!" The brothers were very frightened. "Our enemy has followed us," they cried. "He will punish us!" At once,  they ran away.
Sinziro came down from the tree. He was smiling. "Now all the meat is for me," he said.
For the very first time, Maaloo is collecting vegetables from the garden. He has collected red tomatoes, fresh brinjals and green lady's fingers.
Dadi says, “Well done, Maaloo! Go and get some potatoes too.”
Maaloo looked at all the trees, creepers and plants. Not a single potato could he see.
“Dadi, the potatoes aren’t ready yet,” said Maaloo, putting the empty basket down. “No Maaloo, there are plenty of potatoes. Look carefully,” said Dadi.
Maaloo went into the garden once more. Kaaloo followed him. Maaloo was looking for potatoes when he heard, “Woof! Woof!”
“Kaaloo! Stop, Kaaloo!” yelled Maaloo, running behind him. “Don’t spoil the garden.” Maaloo saw that Kaaloo was digging away and what do you think was coming out of the mud?Big fat potatoes!
“Well done, Kaaloo. You found the potatoes!” laughed Maaloo, filling his basket with potatoes.

One day Akadeli, Lucy, Acharait and Mary went to the forest far from home to pick wild fruits. They held hands to cross the big river near the forest.
They found a tree full of ripe fruits. The girls agreed to climb up the tree and to pick the fruits with their eyes closed.
Lucy, Acharait and Mary did not close their eyes. Only Akadeli closed hers as she picked the fruits.
When they opened their eyes, only Akadeli had picked unripe fruits.
Lucy, Acharait and Mary laughed at Akadeli and left for home. Akadeli threw away the unripe fruits and began picking ripe ones.
Soon, Akadeli filled her basket with ripe fruits. She set off alone, crossing the big river.
Half way across the river, Akadeli's basket fell and was carried away. She was angry and began to cry.
Before Akadeli got out of the water, she saw a big fish and grabbed it.
As Akadeli carried the fish home, a hawk snatched it and flew away with it.
Akadeli saw that the hawk had left behind a feather from its tail. Although she was disappointed, she picked up the feather and continued walking home.
She came across a traditional wedding. People dancing were wearing grass on their heads instead of feathers as was the tradition. They took her feather and gave her a big bull!
Akadeli reached home with her bull. Her parents and relatives were so happy.Lucy, Acharait and Mary wished they had not lied to Akadeli. It was a lucky day for Akadeli!

Once upon a time, there was a boy called Petros. He was a very clever student. He came first in his class and his parents were proud of him. But Petros wished he had a brother, a sister, or a pet to play with.
One day he asked his mom, "Can I play outside? I have studied all morning and I want to play with my friends now." His mom replied, "All right! Go, but don't be late!"
On the way to the playground, Petros saw something unusual. It was a little dog with white and brown spots. The dog was stuck in a hole and he was scared. "Don't worry, I won't hurt you. I will help you," said Petros.
Petros helped the dog out of the hole. He barked with joy, dancing around the boy and licking him. "You are going to be my dog," said Petros happily as they continued to the playground.
The dog ran far ahead. When Petros' friends saw the dog running towards them, they said, "This dog might be dangerous. It might bite us." They picked up stones and threw them at the little dog. Petros was running and shouting for his friends to stop.
The friends did not hear Petros. The small dog ran as fast as he could to save his life. Then he hid from the boys who were chasing him. They did not find him.
Petros' friends went back to the playground and found Petros crying. "What is wrong?" asked one of them. "You chased my dog!" cried Petros. They were shocked and said, "We didn't know it was your dog. We're sorry. Let's find him."
"It's no use. We will never find my dog," said Petros in a hopeless voice. "Yes, we will find him. Get up Petros, we will find your dog. We must not lose hope," his friends said, consoling him.
Petros and his friends searched for the dog all afternoon until they got tired. Finally, Petros said, "There is one last place where the dog could be. If we don't find him there, I will search no more. Let's go to the river."
When the dog saw the boys coming, he was scared. He tried to cross the river but he was scared of the water. He was about to jump into the river, when he heard Petros calling, "Stop, don't jump!"
The dog turned around, saw Petros and ran to him. Petros hugged the dog and the dog licked Petros's face. "My friend! I thought you were gone forever!" cried Petros.
Back at the playground, Petros gave his friends some advice. "Before you make decisions, think about what could happen as a result. Be careful of hurting others." His friends thought about his words and said, "We are sorry. The dog will be our friend too."

Once upon a time, there was a very rich man called Mpunzi. He had a wife and one daughter called Nosisa. Mpunzi wanted a son, but he and his wife could not have any more children. Mpunzi blamed his wife for not giving him a son. He bullied his wife and treated her like a child.
One day, Mpunzi was very angry and he hit his wife with a stick. She ran away back to her family. She left with a sad heart because Mpunzi did not let her take Nosisa with her. Mpunzi bullied his daughter in the same way he bullied his wife. Nosisa lived a very sad life.
Mpunzi decided to marry another wife. He hoped that the new wife would give him a baby boy. Nosisa's life became even more difficult when her father married again. Mpunzi scolded her all the time and made her serve the new wife. Nosisa worked like a slave.
Mpunzi loved his new wife very much. He treated her like a queen. She sat inside her hut all day and gave orders to Nosisa and the servants. Nosisa woke up early every day to make tea for her stepmother. She cleaned her hut and cooked for her.  Her stepmother always complained that her food was cold, her tea was weak, and her hut was not clean.
One day, Mpunzi became very angry at Nosisa. He scolded her and hit her with a stick. Nosisa stayed at the river and cried the whole afternoon. Suddenly, she heard a voice coming out of the river. The voice was coming from a big fish. Nosisa was so shocked she almost ran away, but the fish said, "Please don't run away my daughter, I am your mother. I have changed myself into a fish so that your father does not know it's me."
"What is the matter?" asked the fish. Nosisa told the fish everything about her sad life. "Don't worry my girl. I will bring you food every day," said the fish. The fish gave fresh vegetables to Nosisa. She had a feast. When she looked up the fish was gone. That day Nosisa went home smiling. She would not have to go to bed without food as usual.
Every day, Nosisa woke up as usual and did her chores around the house. At midday, she went to the river. She called out every time, and every time the fish would appear with delicious food. Nosisa became happier and happier. She could talk to the fish about anything. She started to regain her health. Her skin was glowing and she was a happy child.
Nosisa visited the fish every day until her stepmother became suspicious. Nosisa had gained weight. "Something is going on at the river, I must find out what it is," thought the stepmother. One afternoon she followed Nosisa to the river and saw her talking to the fish, and getting delicious food. Nosisa's secret was out. "I have to do something about this fish," said the stepmother.
In the evening, Mpunzi came back from the fields. He found his new wife crying in her hut. "What is wrong my lovely wife," asked Mpunzi. "I went to a traditional doctor," said the wife. "He told me that the only way for me to give you a son is to eat the biggest fish that lives in this nearby river," she said. "Will you catch the fish for me tonight?" pleaded the woman. "I will do anything for you my beautiful wife," said Mpunzi.
Mpunzi set off to the river before it was too dark. He took his servants to help him find the biggest fish in that river. They searched and searched and eventually Mpunzi caught the biggest fish. He put it in a bag and went home with it. When he got to the house, there was a good hot fire ready to cook the fish. "I will make the best meal ever for us," said the woman to Mpunzi. "You are the bravest and strongest man I know." Mpunzi was very pleased with himself.
That night Mpunzi and his wife went to bed happy after their delicious meal. They left the bones on the table for Nosisa to clean in the morning. When Nosisa brought coffee into their hut in the morning they were still sleeping. "This is very strange," she thought to herself. "My father usually wakes up very early in the morning to go to the fields. I wonder why he is still sleeping."
"Anyway, now I can run to the river for a nice breakfast," she thought. Nosisa ran to the river. When she got there she called out to the fish, and she called again and again. The fish never came. Nosisa started to cry. She did not know what had happened to the fish. While she was crying a bird came to sit next to her and told her what had happened. She cried harder thinking that her mother had been caught and eaten.
The bird told her to collect the fish bones from the table and throw them back into the river. If she did that the fish would come back to life. The bird also told her to let her father and stepmother sleep and wake them up only at midday. Nosisa did as she was told. She ran back home and walked quietly into her father's hut. They were still fast asleep. She took the bones, put them inside a bag and threw them back into the river.
Nosisa ran back home and just before midday she woke her father and stepmother. She could hardly recognise them. They looked old and grey and frail. They were too old to scold her. They were too weak to hit her. They were too tired to look after the homestead. So, Nosisa took over the homestead and her father's wealth. She called all the servants and told them what had happened. They prepared a feast and there was peace at the homestead from that day on.
It was evening. Cows, goats and sheep were returning to their sheds. The farmer made sure they all returned home safely.
The clever Rabbit was awake inside his hutch. He was thinking, “I want to explore the outside world.” The other rabbits were dozing.
The door to their hutch opened. The farmer came in. It was meal time for the rabbits.
The food smelled nice. All the other rabbits were awake now. They hopped closer to the farmer.
The clever Rabbit watched the farmer walk out the hutch. “Aha! Now I know how I can sneak out. Tomorrow I must get out of here.”
“I’ll hop into the basket when the farmer brings in food,” the clever Rabbit thought. The other rabbits quickly finished their meal and fell asleep.
In the morning, the farmer brought in food for the rabbits. “Today is the day,” the clever Rabbit thought to himself. “I must get out of this hutch.”As soon as the farmer put the basket down, the clever Rabbit quickly jumped in. No one saw him. After the farmer had fed the other rabbits, he carried the basket outside.
The cleverRabbit was finally free! He sang to himself. He walked around like a king. Suddenly, a dog came up to the clever Rabbit and started barking at him.The clever Rabbit hadn’t thought of this danger.
The dog chased the clever Rabbit, who ran and ran and ran.
The clever Rabbit just managed to outrun the dog.
The clever Rabbit was now in the forest. He found some tender, sweet grass to eat. Food had never tasted so good back in the hutch. Full, he dozed off.
The clever Rabbit was awakened by the loud roaring of a lion. “Ngrrrrr! Ngrrrr!” The sound was terribly scary.
The lion was hungry. He chased the clever Rabbit. The clever Rabbit ran for his life. “Will I escape alive?” he wondered. The clever Rabbit ran all night long.
When it was daybreak, the clever Rabbit couldn't believe his eyes. He was back at the farmer's house!
The door to the hutch was open. He saw the farmer feeding the other rabbits.
The clever Rabbit snuck in behind the farmer.
He was starving. He ate till he was full again. “I know better now. The outside world is sweet, but also bitter,” he told himself.
From that day on, the clever Rabbit learned more and more about his world inside the farm. He even advised other rabbits on their issues!

Once upon a time, there was a man called Byantaka who had a cow. Each day Byantaka grazed his cow. He also gave the cow water to drink. But Byantaka only had a very small pot for water.
So he went at his neighbour's home to borrow a bigger pot for water. His neighbour agreed to lend Byantaka his biggest clay pot saying, "My neighbour's problem is my problem."
After a few days, Byantaka went to apotter's place and bought a small pot. He took it home. He put the small pot inside the big pot that he had borrowed from his neighbour.
Then he put the big pot, with the small pot inside it,on his head. He carried the big pot to the neighbour who loaned him the pot.
Byantaka told him, "I am returning your pot, it has reproduced." The neighbour was amazed that his pot had produced another pot. He praised Byantaka saying, "Your home is blessed."
After a while, Byantaka went back to his neighbour to borrow the pot again. He did not have good intentions.
The owner of the big pot waited in vain for Byantaka to return his pot. Eventually he went to Byantaka's home and said, "I have come for my pot."
Byantaka told his neighbour, "My friend, our pot died. I was just on my way to tell you the bad news."
His neighbour clapped his hands together in surprise. His face began to swell with anger. He shouted at Byantaka, "I have never heard of a pot dying!"
Byantaka replied, "My friend you should accept these things. Everything that produces must die. I was also very sorry about the big pot's death."
His neighbour was very angry and he went to court to report Byantaka. The judge listened to explanations from both of them. He found the owner of the pot was in the wrong.
"When Byantaka told you that the pot had reproduced, you accepted. When he says that every living thing which reproduces must die, he is correct." That is how the judge judged the case.
Byantaka's neighbour went home walking like a snail. Byantaka had got the big pot with his cleverness.
I wonder ifthere's another me somewhere in the world.
Who looks thesame.
And talks thesame.
And even has mycurls.
Someone with myeyes my ears.
Who even has mylaugh.
Who can do what Ican do.
And can't do whatI can't.
I've looked andlooked everywhere to find another me. I went down to the park and looked behindthe trees.
I looked around,up and down.
At every singleface.
I couldn't find anotherme in any single place.
There's only oneme in the world! I'm special, oh it's true!
But not just me,don't you see? There's only one of you!
There once lived a man with a lot of livestock. He kept goats, camels, cows and donkeys. The man was married to a beautiful woman.
For a long time, the man and his wife did not have a baby. Then the woman gave birth to a beautiful girl. They named the baby Muurui. The man was happy and proud.
The woman was very busy. She left her baby alone in the hut and went to milk cows. The baby's gourd of milk was also in the hut.
When the baby was alone in the hut, she would wake up. She would drink all of the milk, and begin to cry. Her mother would run home to nurse her.
The woman always found the gourd empty. This was surprising! Who drank the milk?
The woman shared this problem with her husband. He decided to find out what happened to the milk.
The man hid in the hut when his wife went out. To his surprise, the baby got up and drank the milk!  It was unbelievable.
The man told his wife what he saw and they decided to leave. They went at night, when the baby was asleep. They left their home.
And so, the magic baby was abandoned by her parents. They left her a goat, a cow and a camel. When Muurui awoke, she found the compound was quiet. She was all alone.
She felt angry. She killed the goat and the camel. Then she decided to hide inside the cow's stomach.
While Muurui's cow was grazing, a man passed by and saw it. He said, "I will slaughter this cow for beef." He speared the cow.
As this man was skinning the cow, he heard a voice say,  "Do not harm me, I am in the cow's stomach!"
Muurui then grabbed the man's head. He got such a fright that he ran away. He left the cow.
When the man got home,  he slaughtered a fat ram. He cooked the meat and took it to the magic baby.
Muurui ate and was happy. The magic baby disappeared into the night.
Shanti and Arun were good friends. They had so much fun together.They shared secrets in class. They ran races on the way home.She was always cheerful.
One day, Shanti came into the classroom slowly. Her head was bent. She looked sad. “Did someone scold you?” asked Arun.Shanti shook her head. She sat down and did not look up. She did not answer ‘Present!’ when Sona Miss called her name. Sona Miss called again, louder this time, “Shanti Kumar!” Shanti raised her hand.
“Do you have a sore throat?” her teacher asked her. Shanti shook her head.Her cheeks were red and it looked like she had a fever.“Are you feeling okay?” Sona Miss asked.Shanti nodded, still not daring to look up.
“Why does Shanti look so sad?”“Is your little brother okay?”“Is your puppy okay?”“Is your grandmother okay?”Shanti kept nodding her head to each of her friends. But she did not look up.
Arun wanted to make her smile. He had an idea! He took out something from his bag.As he ran to show it to Shanti, it slipped out of his hands. Shanti saw something flying towards her and she grabbed it.
It was a BIG, green, rubber frog!Shanti's eyes flew open. Then she opened her mouth to laugh.THEN Arun and her friends saw why she had not smiled or talked all day!Four of her front teeth had gone missing!
There was a time when all the animals lived together as friends. One day they decided to have a meeting to elect a king.
Rooster wanted to be king. So he lied to the other animals. He told them, “The red comb on my head is fire! Don't touch the comb on my head!”
The other animals believed Rooster. They decided to elect Rooster as their king. The animals hoped that Rooster's fire would help them in cold weather.
Then came a day when it rained. And rained. And rained. It was cold. Everything was wet and cold.
“Where can we get fire to warm our bodies?” Rabbit asked the other animals.
“We can get fire from the comb on Rooster's head,” replied Monkey. “Rooster is our king because he has fire on his head,” said Monkey.
The animals agreed with Monkey. They sent Fox to collect fire from king Rooster.
Fox found Rooster in a deep sleep. So he decided to take fire without asking Rooster.
Fox collected some dry grass. He put the grass next to the comb on Rooster's head. Nothing happened. The grass did not catch fire.
“Wake up king Rooster!” yelled Fox. “We need fire now.”
But Rooster could not give fire to Fox.
Fox was angry. He went back to the other animals. He told them the truth about the comb on Rooster's head. From that day, no one was afraid of Rooster. And foxes eat roosters and their families.
Ostrich and Lioness were great friends. Both of them had young ones.
Unlike the Lioness, the Ostrich fed her chicks well.
The Lioness' cubs had little food to eat.
The Lioness looked at the Ostrich's chicks and thought, “They are beautiful! I wish they were mine.”
One day, when the Ostrich was away, the Lioness took the chicks away to her home.
The Ostrich returned and found the cubs in her home instead.  “Where are my children?” she cried.
The Ostrich ran to the Lioness' hut and saw her chicks with Lioness.
The Lioness refused to let the Ostrich take her chicks. She said, “They are mine now. You can have the cubs.”
The Ostrich was angry and upset. “What can I do to get back my children?” she wondered to herself.
Then she thought, “I know what to do. I will call all the animals for a meeting.”
The animals gathered together.
Elephant asked the Ostrich and Lioness to speak.
Most of the animals were afraid to blame the Lioness.
Finally, Squirrel stood up and said, “Children that look like birds, belong to the Ostrich. Those with tails, belong to the Lioness.”
Then Squirrel disappeared into a hole. All the animals cheered.
Lioness was very annoyed. She went home with her cubs.
Long, long ago, the Sky God, Nyame, kept all stories locked in a wooden box, high in the sky. People down on earth had no stories to tell and they were very sad. They asked Anansi the clever Spider to help them.
Anansi spun a long thread, and climbed up his sticky thread all the way to heaven. “Can I have the stories, please?” he asked the Sky God. But Nyame laughed at Anansi and said, “Oh, these are very expensive stories. You wouldn't be able to pay for them, little spider.”
“How much do the stories cost?” asked Anansi. “You'll have to bring me three rare and fierce animals,” Nyame answered, “A leopard with sharp teeth like spears, a hornet that stings people, and a snake that swallows people whole.” He laughed and laughed. He thought his stories were quite safe.
So Anansi climbed slowly back down his sticky thread to the earth. He thought and he thought, and he came up with a plan. He dug a deep hole, covered it with branches and dirt so it was hidden, and he went home for supper. In the morning, sure enough, a leopard had fallen into his pit. He was furiously scratching at the side of the pit, but he couldn't get out.
“Oh let me help you, my dear friend!” said Anansi. “Just lie down on these sticks and I'll pull you out.” Anansi wound his sticky web round the leopard and the sticks, and pulled him up to heaven to show the Sky God. But Nyame just laughed and said, “Where are the other two?”
So Anansi went back down to earth to get the second creature. He thought and he thought and he came up with a plan. He took a gourd full of water and went to the tree where the hornets lived. He poured out some of the water all over their nest. Then he cut a leaf from a banana tree and held it over his head, and he poured the rest of the water all over himself.
He called out to the hornets, “Hey hornets! Come see! It is raining! Quick ­get inside my gourd and it will keep all of you dry.” Hornets don't like to get wet, so they all flew into Anansi's gourd.
Then Anansi quickly spun a web across the opening so the hornets couldn't get out no matter how much they buzzed. He carried them up to heaven and showed them to the Sky God. But Nyame just said, “Where's the last one?” (He wasn't laughing so much anymore.).
So Anansi went down to earth again. He thought and thought and he thought, but he couldn't come up with a plan. So he asked his wife, who had a very good idea. Together they found a good long thick branch and some strong vines. When they got near the stream where the snake lived, they began to argue. “The branch is longer!” “No, it isn't!” “Yes it is!”
Soon the snake came out and asked what the argument was. “I was arguing with my wife,” said Anansi. “She says this stick is longer than you are. But I don't agree.” “Of course I'm longer than that stick!” said the snake. “I'm very long! I'm a huge snake! Just put your stick next to me and measure!”
So Anansi did that, and he tied the snake to the stick with his vine to keep him straight. When he was all tied up, Anansi took the snake up to heaven.
Nyame had to admit that Anansi had paid his price. So he went to his wooden box, opened the lid, and gave all the stories to Anansi. Anansi carried the stories triumphantly down to earth. He shared them with his wife, and with all the other animals and people. Stories are for telling, not for keeping in wooden boxes.
Long ago, Ugali and Fish lived together in a village. They grew to become close friends.
One day, Fish asked Ugali to accompany him to the lake for a swim.Together, they headed for the lake.
When they arrived on the shore of the lake, Fish said to Ugali, "Let me jump in first." He dived into the lake.
After swimming for a while, Fish said to Ugali, "Now, it is your turn to swim."Ugali answered, "I cannot swim. If I dive in like you, I will drown and dissolve."
Fish persuaded Ugali saying, "Please try. You won't dissolve and if you drown, I'll rescue you." So, Ugali agreed to try.Ugali was unable to float. He called Fish, "Please, come and rescue me," but Fish did not rescue him.
Man heard Fish complaining about not being able to rescue Ugali. Man asked, "What is the problem?"Fish explained, "This stupid Ugali dived into the water and now he is drowning." Man rescued Ugali.
When Ugali came out of the water, he said, "Fish is not a good friend. He persuaded me to swim and yet I don't know how to do so."Man said, "Let me resolve this problem." He sliced up Ugali and Fish and enjoyed eating them together. And that was the end of their conflict.

In a village, there was a young boy whose name was Abula. He did not like to read or even to open a book. He was a lazy pupil. He behaved badly.
Abula stole his mother's money to buy sweets. Even when she hid her money, he found it and took it. After eating all his sweets, Abula would play with his friends.
After a while, Abula stopped going to school. He stayed out playing the whole day, only returning home in the evening. Abula's mother noticed this and became worried.
“Our son is not behaving well. I do not think he is attending school. He is also stealing money from me,” said Abula's mother. His father thought about how best to change Abula's behaviour.
He said to his wife, “Next time, hide the money within the pages of a book. He never even opens a book, so the money will be safe there.”
The next day, Abula looked for his mother's money. He searched everywhere but he did not find anything. He decided to go to the nearest market to find some money.
His father saw where Abula was going. “My son, I know why you are going to the market. Now go back inside and look in the books for money,” he said.
Abula was puzzled, but he went and searched in the books. He found the money that his mother had hidden.
The next day, he looked in the books again. But there was nothing hidden there. He went to his father to ask why there was no money in the books.
His father smiled and replied, “My son, do you want to get enough money to buy many sweets?” Abula answered, “Of course, father.”
His father said, “Listen to me carefully. Read your books and attend your classes. You will find rewards in books. Do not give up.” “But father, reading is a difficult activity. Books are boring!” Abula replied.
For a while, Abula's father was quiet. He thought about how to encourage his son. Then he said to Abula, “Let us read together. I will help you to find the wealth in books.”
Today,we will climb up a ladder together. It is a rather unusual ladder. Inthis ladder, the distance between the rungs gets bigger and BIGGER and BIGGER as you climb up the steps, growing 10 times at each step. Sometimes we will climb one step at a time and at other times we will skip many steps at one go.Thefunny thing is that we are not even sure which the last step is orwhether the steps go on forever. Let the exciting journey begin!
Step0: 1 metreWhatdo a five year old boy, a cricket bat and a newborn baby elephanthave in common? All of them have a height of about 1 metre (or 1m forshort)! It would be awkward to say that the ceiling of a room is 3baby elephants high. So we make the sensible choice of saying thatthe height of the ceiling is 3 metres.
Step1: 10 metresNowthat you have a feel for the size of one metre, we are ready to climbto the next step of our ladder, at 10 metres. A three storey buildingor a mango tree is roughly 10 metres high. A cricket pitch is abouttwice that length. Canyou think of other objects that are about 10 m long or high?
Step2: 100 metresHaveyou noticed that with every step we add a zero to the right of thenumber we had before and the step number matches the number ofzeroes? Keep track of that as we climb along. Ifyou have run the 100m race on school sports day, or watched sprintersdo it on TV, you know exactly how far that is. Now imagine if the100m track stood up! That would be about the height of two GolGumbaz*-es. *TheGol Gumbaz in Bijapur, Karnataka, is the tomb of Mohammed Adil Shah.When it was built in 1656, it had the largest dome in the world. Itheld the record until 1881!
Step3: 1000 metresThousandmetres has a special name - it is called 1 kilometre or 1 km. Youwould cover this distance if you ran the 100 metre race 10 times -phew!  You would need to climb about 9 km to reach the top of MountEverest.
Step6: 10,00,000 metres Nowlet's skip 2 steps and go to step 6, which has six zeroes to theright of 1.Thedistance from the northern tip of India in Kashmir to the southerntip at Kanyakumari is about 4 times this distance, or 4 times10,00,000 m, or 40,00,000 m. Because 40,00,000 m is quite a mouthful,we usually say 4000 km, which is the same thing.
Step8: 10,00,00,000 metresHowfar away is the bright, beautiful moon? It is right there on the 8thstep of our distance ladder at about 4 times 10,00,00,000 m, or4,00,000 km away from the earth!
Step11: 1,00,00,00,00,000 metresLetus skip two more steps and race to the blazing hot Sun. How far awayis it? It is about 10,00,00,000 km PLUS another5,00,00,000 km. That is very, VERY far away indeed!Butthe far, far away sun still lights up the world and makes us sweat insummer. Amazing, isn't it?
LastStep???Isthere a last step on the ladder? We don’t know yet!  But withpowerful telescopes, scientists have been able to see way beyond thesun. The farthest object that they have been able to spot is on the26thstep, 10,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 m away! That is SERIOUSLY FAR!Maybewhen you grow up, you can discover something even further away, onthe 28th or 29th step. Isn’t that an exciting thought?
Fun with MeasuringThe following activity done in a classroom setting is a greatway to give children a feel for large distances and can engage the childreneither in a single group, or in teams. 1. Ask the children to cut long strips (each about an inchwide) from old newspapers.  2. Ask them to stick the strips end to end with tape or glueto make longer strips, until they get a strip that is 1 metre long (they canuse a measuring tape for this).  3.  Now ask thechildren to use this 1 m long strip as a measure and make 10 similar strips andstick them end to end to make a 10 m long strip. They can lie down next to thisstrip, head to head and feet to feet, and see how many of them it takes to make10 m.  4. They can then stick ten 10 m strips together to make a 100m strip that goes round the classroom many times.  5. What about a 1 km strip? How many times does that goaround the classroom? Which team was able to create a 1 km long strip fastest?
Notes for Parents & Teachers: - When writing down big numbers with lots of zeroes after the 1, it is very easy for children - and adults! - to make mistakes. That is why the 'Powers of 10' notation is such a useful thing. Through this book, children can be taught how to use it - all they need to do is to count the number of zeroes to the right of the 1, and write that number as a superscript of 10. For instance, 1000, which has 3 zeroes after the 1, can be written as 103. And 10000000 (7 zeroes after the 1), can be compactly written as 107. Simple! - In this book, we stopped our 'How far is far?' game at the Sun. If you want to take the game further, you may want to bring in the nearest star beyond the Sun, Proxima Centauri, which is 1016 m away from the Sun. Or the distance from one end of the Milky Way to another, which is 1,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 (or 1021) m! - One thing you should know is that the distances that are given in the book are approximate, not exactly accurate. For example, 3984 km is given as 4000 km. This is not 'unscientific'. Rough estimates are very useful in science! Maybe you can do an activity with the kids to emphasize this. Is the length of a pencil closer to 101 cm or 102 cms? Is the weight of the school bus closer to 103 kgs or 104 kgs? Let the children come up with their own questions for their classmates too.
Once, a rabbit thought to itself, "I have been eating raw carrots so far...
"Let me cook and eat it. "
"How do I cook?"
"Let me ask for help in this house"
But, there was a dog that started barking . He also chased the rabbit.
"Oh dear! What do I do now?" thought the rabbit.
He kept the carrots in the sun. The carrots didn't  cook.
He cooked the carrots in the fire. The carrots became too bitter!
"How do I cook and eat this? " Thought the rabbit furiously to himself.
He found a tortoise shell.
He gathered twigs.
He also found stones!
The rabbit lit the stove.
He also invited his friends to eat.
Everybody enjoyed eating the finely cooked carrots!
﻿We love going to Grandmother's village!
In Granny's garden stands a big mango tree.So many birds come and perch on it.
I like hiding on this tree.Nobody can find me here.
Dad searches for me near the well, and Mom searches near the cowshed.However, none of them find me.
Oh no!Granny's dog has found me.
Now I must climb down.Granny hugs me tightly.
The year was 1870. New London, Connecticut, United States. 7 am. Kids were tumbling out of bed, their mothers hurrying them to clean their teeth, handing them tooth sticks and jars of toothpaste.
What? Did I just say – “Toothsticks”?That’s right. They used toothsticks to clean their teeth back in 1870. A toothstick was simply a twig with a frayed end. Some lucky kids had twigs with boar hair tied to one end for that extra shine.
And what was that other thing I said? “Jars of toothpaste”?That’s right. Toothpaste tubes were not invented yet. They only had jars.And every bleary eyed kid started her day by dipping a toothstick into a porcelain jar filled with toothpaste.
Actually, into the same porcelain jar that every other member of the family dipped their toothstick into. Including that visiting grand aunt with yellow and black teeth, whose toothstick matched her teeth.
One morning, a disgusted cry went up in a dentist’s house. “Ewwwwwwwwww!” It was Dr. Sheffield’s son Lucius, who refused to dip into the jar anymore and decided to use tooth powder henceforth. But a thought remained in his mind – there must be a better way to use toothpaste.
A few years later, Lucius went to Paris to study the science of dentistry. There, he saw artists squeezing paint from metal tubes on to their paintbrushes. Why couldn't the same type of tube be used to hold toothpaste?! He rushed back home and shared this idea with his father, who thought that it was just totally awesome.
Therewas just that little matter of figuring out how to get the toothpastefroma jar intothe tube through that little opening. Howdo you think Lucius could fill toothpaste into an empty tube?Haveyou had a bad morning when you squeezed way too much paste in yourhalf asleep  state? And you seethat there’s toothpaste all over the sink and your mother is remindingyou that the school bus will be at the doorstep in twenty minutes,and the last thing you want is for her to flip when she sees the messyou’ve made? How would you go about putting the toothpaste backinto the tube? Now, whatdo you think Lucius and his father used to fill a tube withtoothpaste? Aear bud? Or a really tiny spoon? A toothpick?
It was not as messy as you’d expect, because the way Dr. Sheffield and his team did it was without opening the cap! That’s right, they kept the cap screwed on tight, and opened up the other end! It’s definitely easier to fill a tube from the larger end, especially if you have something to pump the paste with, like a syringe. After that, all you have to do is seal the end tight so that the paste will not leak.
Today, toothpaste tubes are filled using machines. All the empty tubes are lined up on a conveyer belt with their caps downwards and the unsealed end pointing up. A big container filled with toothpaste is fixed above the conveyor belt.
From a nozzle at the bottom of the container, the toothpaste is let into each of these tubes as they move along the conveyor belt. But the paste is not filled all the way to the brim. About half an inch is left so that it can be sealed.Now the tube is ready to be squeezed!
Ancient Indian wisdom for good teeth Many people in India use datun, the twig of a neem or babool tree, instead of a factory-made brush. Datun keeps teeth and gums healthy. But do you know which the best brush in the world is? Your fingers, say dentists! Great for the teeth and gums. Have you tried tooth powder? What are the different smells that you can detect in it?Herbs and spices that are good for teeth include mint, clove, cinnamon, black pepper and tulsi. Eating fibrous fruits and vegetables, like apples and carrots, is good for cleaning teeth.
Fun with toothpaste caps
One day there was a great famine in the land. No one had anything to eat except the crows. Each morning they flew a long distance to where there was a tree with ripe figs in the middle of a wide river. Then they flew back with the figs for themselves and their relatives. The sight of so many figs made Anansi's mouth water. How could he get them for himself?
He thought of a plan. He carefully covered his bottom with sticky beeswax. Then he took a piece of clay pot and went to see the crows. “Please could you help me?” he asked. “I need a live coal to get my fire going again.” As they were getting the coal from the fire, Anansi carefully sat firmly on one of the largest figs, so that it would stick to his bottom. He thanked the crows, and hurried home to enjoy the fig.
But one fig wasn't enough for him. He went back a second time, and did the same. When he went back a third time, the crows began to get suspicious. “Why do you keep coming back to us to get a coal?” they said. Anansi answered, “Every time when I get home, the coal has burnt out.” “You're lying!” said the crows. “You just want our food!” “That's not true,” said Anansi. And he started crying.
The crows felt sorry for him. The next morning at first light, each crow gave him a feather. He flew with them to the fig tree in the middle of the wide river. When he saw the luscious figs, Anansi wanted them all for himself. Each time a crow tried to pick a fig, he shouted out, “That one is mine! I saw it first!” And then he took the fig and put it into his bag. Eventually he had all the figs and the crows had none.
He was left all alone as the darkness began to fall. “If I don't want to stay in this tree for the rest of my life,” he said to himself, “I'll just have to jump into the air like the crows.” So he took a deep breath, jumped, and PLOP! He fell into the river right among the crocodiles.
“What do we have here?” said a gruff crocodile voice. “A tasty morsel to eat, nyum”. “Oh please don't” said Anansi. And he began to cry. “I'm one of you, don't you know? I got lost in the days of your grandfathers and no one was able to find me. You're the first of my relatives I've ever met!” He cried so much that the crocodiles felt sorry for him.
The oldest crocodile said, “We'll know you're one of us if you can eat and enjoy mud soup just like we do.” They gave him a pot of dirty brown water. “Just like my grandmother used to make it!” Anansi said. But he made a hole in the ground with his back foot, and a hole in the pot with his front foot. As he pretended to drink the soup, it oozed down through the pot into the hole beneath his feet.
“Delicious!” he exclaimed, giving back the empty pot. "Now we know you are definitely one of us," the crocodiles said. So they allowed Anansi to sleep in their hole with them for the night. "Tomorrow morning I'll tell you the story of my life," said Anansi as they fell asleep.
Early the next morning, before first light, Anansi woke up one of the crocodiles. "I want to go and fetch my wife and children from across the river, so that they can help me tell my story. Will you help me before the others wake up?" he asked the crocodile.
The crocodile was grumpy at being woken up so early. “Please help me! You swim much faster than I do,” Anansi said. The crocodile agreed, and Anansi rode on his back to the bank of the river. He climbed off quickly. “I'll be back soon! Don't go away!” Anansi said, as he disappeared through the grass.
As far as we know, the crocodile is waiting for him still, with just his long snout and his beady eyes above the surface of the river.

Today is my first day of school. Mother held my hand and walking with me. "Now I have grown up," I say. "Come...come!"Mother held my hand tightly.
There are many children near the school.Some come by bus. Some come by car.Some come by rickshaw. Some come by bicycle and some come on foot, like me.
We reached to the gate.Mother left my hand.She stopped on gate. I have to go alone inside.Many unknown faces are around me.
I moved one step. I moved another step.  I looked behind. As I move forward, mother looks smaller. Would she disappeared? I ran to her. I don't think I've grown up. I hold her hand and say, "don't go".

In a far away town, there was a smart and expensive shoe shop. This is the town in which I was born.
Many people came to this shoe shop, but few could afford to buy the fancy footwear. One day, a rich man with big feet visited the shop.
He put his money on the shop counter. Then, with his hands in his pockets, he walked up and down looking at the shoes.
As he came closer, I held my breath and froze. He stretched out his hands and grabbed me. He sat down and put me on his feet.
He had huge feet, and the smell nearly suffocated me! I was packed into a box. We drove home, and he put me in a cupboard.
He wore me every day. I made him smart and he walked with confidence. I had a hard life. He was always lazy about washing his feet.
In return, sometimes I pinched him, making him limp. Eventually, I became old and broken, with scars and cracks. He put me outside, next to the rubbish bin.
Someone picked me up for recycling, and took me to a leather workshop. At the workshop I was made into a shiny new wallet! I began a new life.

Once upon a time, there was a hardworking farmer. He had a hardworking wife, and two sons
He had enough food because he and his wife worked very hard. He wanted his children to have a good life. He never let them do any work.
After some time, his wife died.
The man still did not want his children to work. He did the field labour and all the housework too.
But as time went on, the man became old and sick. He started to worry about what would become of his children when he died. They would not be able to take care of themselves.
He called his sons. He said, "My inheritance to you is a lot of gold hidden in the fields. So, it's up to you to plough them and find the gold."
He also called his neighbours and said, "I'm going to die soon. My sons do not know how to look after themselves. Please look after them until they can do it for themselves."
After the man died, the neighbours provided his sons with food for some time.
The brothers did not want to be robbed of the gold their father buried. They decided to do the digging themselves.
They dug one field after another, but they did not find any gold.
They sat down and one asked the other, "Do you think our father cheated us?" The other brother said, "No, I think our father was saying that farming is gold. And if we dig the fields, plant, and plough we can become rich."
So, like all the other farmers, they dug up the fields. They grew wheat and became very rich

My awesome Ajji makes delicious laddoos , I asked Ajji ," May i Please have these yummy for my tummy Laddoos?"She my heart as she uttered,"Not now, beta, may be a little later, not today though, you will get it tomorrow."But I had no patience so ,I could not wait till tomorrow
With a heavy heart i thought for the park i asked Ajja ," May I go out to play with my friends?" he got me into his sweet lovely trap, he simply said," Little later you may go my chap, before that you have to take your nap." But I had no patience to wait till the nap
Then i saw my superman dress,With all my heart i went to mom to address," Can i wear my new costume and do my zip,. zap, zooom"  O her words cleared my doubt when she plainly refused saying you may wear it when we go out
The box attracted me to it right from the start,How to take permission from dad to open it is an unknown art. He refused right away and told me to simply wait. I wanted it right there i knew for sure, So I could not wait any more.
I went to bed with a heavy heart, why do they never learn to say 'yes'? why the elders cannot learn that art?I went to bed all annoyed
Next day when i entered the kitchen it was a sweet surprise. Ajji came to me with a smile She said in her volume which is usually low,," You can eat these laddoos now."
Ajja said,' bring your bat and ball, its time to hit the six  as cricket will b e played by all."Papa also gave me permission to open the box and before i thought it was a haux, I had everyone around me clapping and smiling and loudly they say," Happy Birthday !"
﻿There are four of us in the family. Miguel is my favorite,                              and I follow him everywhere.
I have to keep an eye on Miguel.                                 I'm older than him.
Sometimes Miguel is not careful,                         so I had to guard the house.
﻿I am with him in everything. We sympathize with everyone.
We play with each other.
And Mother scolded us too.
I help Mom when Miguel is busy.   I pimp the birds away from our wares.
Today, Miguel will teach me. Finally, I will learn something new.
I am a kind dog. I'm not chasing cats.
If you're Miguel's friend, I'm your friend too!

Don was a big baboon. He was a bully.
He was the baboon chief.
His followers gave him a special cloth.
“I will wear this on my head,” said Don.
“Everyone follow my orders. Do not question me!” shouted Don.
So, the followers followed their chief. If Don jumped, everyone jumped.
But the band on Don's head was too tight.
He touched his sore head. The baboons all touched their heads.
“This hurts,” said Don.“This hurts,” they copied.
“This is too tight!” “This is too tight,” they copied.
Don fell down, over a cliff. They all copied him.
The baboon chief died. His followers were hurt, but they lived.
This isJadav, a tree-planter. He lovestree-places because they are full of life.No-tree-placesmake him terribly sad, because they are full of dead things.
Years ago,Jadav was walking along the banks of the great Brahmaputra River whenhe arrived at a big, empty no-tree-place.It was dryand hot. The sand was powdery and striped.
Stripedsand? How odd.Jadav wentcloser to take a better look.Oh, butthey weren't stripes at all! The ground was covered in snakes!Lastnight’s floods must have washed them ashore, Jadav thought.
Thesesnakes weren't slinking and slithering and swaying about likeregular, healthy snakes. When Jadav walked among them, they didn'thiss or run away or try to bite him. They just lay about like oldropes, tired and still."Poorsnakes! They're dying from the heat! If only they had some shade tolie in! If only this no-tree-place had some trees in it!"
Jadavcouldn't bear to watch the snakes die. It made him so terribly sadthat he sat down and began to cry.But hequickly came to his senses. "No more crying. From now on: onlytrying!"He jumpedup, ran back to his village and began collecting all the bambooshoots he could carry in his bag. "Regular plants won't grow inthe hot sand, but bamboo will. Bamboo is strong!"
Jadavbrought the shoots to the no-tree-place and started planting themeverywhere. It was hard, hot work, and it took years.The rivergrew thin one summer and flooded the next, sometimes bringing moresand and sometimes taking it away. Heavy rains came and went. ButJadav kept on planting.
In time,the bamboo took root and began to grow. As it grew, it brought shade,and the shade brought insects.The insectsburrowed into the ground, and the earth below the bamboo trees beganto change. The dry and white became rich and brown, and the dead sandbecame living soil.
Jadav wasno longer sad. But he wasn't happy either.He lookedaround his bamboo grove and thought, "A few-trees-place is nice,I know. But how wonderful it would be if this were amany-trees-place!" The idea thrilled him.So Jadavwent back to his village and began collecting many more seeds andsaplings. He filled three big bags with Arjun and ejar and gulmoharand koroi and moj and himolu. "Now that our few-trees-place haslovely brown soil, we can plant all these and more!"
Jadavbrought his new saplings and seeds to the few-trees-place and plantedthem all around.It was hardwork, his back hurt, and it took many years. The orange and blueskies turned purple and pink, and villages became towns. The windgrew laden with dust, and the river became grey. But Jadav's insectfriends helped to till the soil, and his tall bamboos gave him shadeand cooled the air. And Jadav kept on planting.
Soon, his Arjun, ejar and gulmohar, his koroi, moj and himolu, and all his manyother plants dug in, took root and started growing. As they grew,they spread new seeds, and the new seeds, in turn, took root. Shootsbecame trunks, trunks grew branches, and the branches reached for thesky.
Thefew-trees-place that was once a no-tree-place now became a wonderful,green many-trees-place.But what'sa many-trees-place without many tree-creatures? When one came, theothers followed.
First, camethe birds. They flocked and flew in from near and far, to make theirnests in Jadav's tree-place. There were vultures and pelicans andstorks and ducks. And warblers and thrushes and wagtails and chats.
Next, camethe animals. They skipped and swung and sauntered in, to make theirhomes in the many-trees-place. There were buffaloes and deer andrabbits and gibbons. And elephants and tigers and rhinos.
Finally,there came the snakes. They slithered and swayed and sashayed in, tocool themselves in the shade of Jadav's trees.When Jadavsaw the snakes, he sat down and cried happy tears. He was sohappy that he wasn't even afraid of getting bitten.
Jadav'stree-place had filled with feathers and beaks and wings, with clawsand tails and fangs.There werespots and splashes, stripes and flashes, and green, green,everywhere.Thetree-place was a forest, at last. And Jadav was a happy man.
Then Jadavhad another thought. "Many trees in one place is good, I know. But how wonderful it'd be if there were many trees in every place!"So hegrabbed his bags of seeds and started walking across the world. Andas he walked, Jadav started planting the seeds in all theno-tree-places he saw. And he planted. And planted. And planted.But thereare so many no-tree-places in the world. There are moreno-tree-places than tree-places now. This is terribly sad, but Jadavdoes not sit down and cry this time.
Jadav plants.
And plants. And plantssome more.
It’sgoing to be hard work, bringing all the old forests back.The seashave begun rising, and the winds grow cold. Towns have become cities,and Jadav is growing old. But he keeps on planting. And planting. Andplanting.
Jadav willkeep on planting until the whole world is a happy, lovelylots-of-trees-place.
Jadav in Real LifeJadav‘Mulai’ Payeng is a conservationist and recipient of thePadmashree, one of the highest civilian honours awarded by the Indiangovernment. Jadav lives in Majuli, Assam.At the ageof 16, distressed by the sight of dying snakes that had washed up ona sandbar banking the Brahmaputra, Jadav decided to plant some treesin the spot. He started small, with bamboos, and grew an entireforest, plant by painstaking plant. This was back in 1979.Over thenext three decades, Jadav and his tree-planting have managed tochange the soil in the barren area. The 550-hectare sandbar is now alush, dense forest and home to a variety of flora and fauna,including elephants, tigers, apes, deer and many species of local andmigratory birds. Jadav continues to visit and nurture his forestevery day, planting wherever he finds empty patches.
GrowingUp With a Mango Tree: a Tree-Planting ActivityJust ate amango? Loved it? Want another? You can go to a shop and buy one, ofcourse. But it's a lot more fun (and free!) to use the seed of themango you just ate and make a few fruits of your own. All you need istime and patience.First, finda nice patch of empty land near your house. Get a friend, sibling orgrown-up to help you plant the seed you saved in that patch. Makesure the soil is loose and there's plenty of sun. It may take severalweeks of waiting, watering and watching before your seed turns into aplant, so don't worry and definitely don't hurry.
Once yourseed germinates and grows into a healthy mango plant, get ready for alot more waiting, watering and watching. Take care that your plantdoesn't get eaten up by insects or animals, or get stepped on bysomeone. If all this waiting is making you feel bored, read a fewbooks, sing some songs, and plant some more plants!After a fewyears, as you grow taller, your mango plant will grow tall with you,until it becomes a big tree that you can climb and picnic under. Thisis when the real fun begins. By now, your tree will have startedmaking its own mangoes, which you and your friends can eat. Evenbetter, those mangoes will soon start attracting other mango-lovingcreatures to your tree: birds, ants, squirrels, bats, monkeys,spiders and lots more.Some ofthese creatures will come to eat the fruit, some will come to feed onthe tree's sap, some to drink nectar from its flowers, and somecreatures will even come to eat some of the other creatures hangingaround the tree. But it's not all about eating. Some creatures maycome just to rest in your tree's shade, or to take a nap in itsbranches. Your tree has many different uses for every differentcreature!Spend sometime every day watching who visits your mango tree, at which time ofthe day they come, and what they do. Write down what you see in yournotebook. Also draw pictures of what you see.See howmuch you've done and learned with just one mango seed? Isn'ttree-planting fun? Now imagine how much fun Jadav must have hadplanting his entire forest full of trees!
