A rat has entered the house. Grandma was the first to see it."Rat!" He jumped on the sofa as he shouted.The little pillows in it all fell down.
"Where?" Dad climbed out the window as he heard that.The curtains all fell down as he pulled."There!" Mom jumped on the table shouting. The plates in it fell down and broke.
﻿"Catch the mouse," Mithun looked at the cat and shouted.The cat saw the mouse, then ran away and crawled under the bed."Rat!" Mithun ran after the cat shouting.
"I will chase away that rat," said the mother boldly.He took a broom and stabbed here and there."You're a rat," Dad shouted. Mom saw the rat and he too hid under the cot.
"I know how to get rid of this rat!" Grandma jumped down from the sofa. He rolled up a newspaper and stabbed it here and there.
"Rat!" Said Dad. He climbed a little further up the window."Left with you!"Grandma looked at the mouse. He too ran and hid under the bed.
"Damn!" Said Dad. He could not climb above it.Slowly descended from the window. He hid under the bed without catching the mouse's eye!
“Rat! Rat! ” That everyone shouted together.Papa woke up to that noise.She sat up in bed and rubbed her eyes gently.Um, of course, yes, I know this, why it's something known in advance.
It had two eyes, four legs, and a long tail."Rat!" Papa clapped his hands happily.Papa looked at the rat and the rat started to run. Papa also ran backwards!
Climb on the sofa, jump out the window, jump on the table, roll on the pillows ...
... slipped between the curtains, stumbled on the plates, and ran out the door!
Not here, not there.Where have you gone?
Not on the sofa.Not under the cot.
Not in the box.Not under my sister's frock.
Not under the pillow.Not in my bag.Sob, sob, where have you gone?
I have looked in every room, l have looked under every book.
I have looked under the chair,I have looked under the stool.Where have you gone?
Soon granny came back from her walk."Look what I found in the park."
"It can sway, it can bounce.It can spin, it can dangle.Ha-ha, hee-hee," said Granny with a giggle.
Oh Granny! Thank you so much!You have found my dear yo-yo!
"Yo-yo? What a funny name!What a funny toy!I want to play with it,It gives me so much joy!"
Giggle, giggle, giggling away,Granny played, with my little toy.For the rest of the day!

a warm morning , Raja woke up with a yawn and said to himself "lets go for fishing now".
While going to the pond,he met Ram,his best friend and invited him to go to the pond together.
Sita saw them going for fishing. The boys asked her if she wanted to come with them.
Sita thought for a moment and said "don't do this,fishes will die when separated by water"
They didn't paid attention to her and continued on their way to the pond.
Raja and Ram sat near the pond and saw to fishes jumping in water,one was a thin and second a fat one.
There came a third fish. They didn't saw any fish bigger than this! Sita said" This fish is even bigger than my father's foot!"
Raja and Ram took their fishing rods with and struggled for the fish.Ram said"its mine!"Raja said"no,its mine!"
Raja pulled the rod, Ram pulled stronger.
BOOM! They fell down as their rods broke.
Do you know why ?Any guesses ?fished tied their strings together!
One day, Sringeri Srinivas, the farmer, set out with his best cows to the cattle fair. He had to walk along the new national highway that had come up near his village.
That big road had many cars and trucks. Every driver seemed to be honking loudly. Paoon! Ponn! Paaa! The cows did not like the noise. They decided to go back home.
He waved his hands at the drivers to stop the noise. This did not help. Seeing him, they just honked louder. The noise of the horns went straight into his head. And it stayed there. It was a bad day for him. He went back home with his cows. MOOO! The cows were happy to be in the cowshed again.
But the noise simply would not go away from his head.Paoon! Ponn! Paaa! It kept on playing like a band of untrained musicians. Other noises around him soon joined in the chorus. Even the sounds that he heard daily suddenly became too loud for Sringeri Srinivas.
The ribbit ribbit of the frogs was noisy.The cicadas and their kirkk kirkk were tooloud. Sringeri Srinivas wanted the hooting owls to be sent away. He wasangry at the koyals for screeching loudly at 4 am.
And at the cows that mooed at 5 am. Andwhoever asked the roosters to act as alarm clocks? And that stupidtiger! Enough of his roaring!
Poor Sringeri Srinivas. His ears had become raw, like a fresh wound. He tried hard to keep things quiet.He shouted at the children if they talkedloudly. He glared at his wife Parvatamma when the pressure cookerwhistled and whistled.
Sringeri Srinivas only wanted silence. Everyone tried to help. Parvatamma stopped scolding the children. The children played cricket quietly with a very soft ball.
The cows did not moo any more. The cicadas and owls moved to another village. Even the tiger stopped growling.
Yet Sringeri Srinivas was not happy. He could hear the noise of everyone trying to be silent!
“I will go away from this place,” he declared one morning. “Please don’t,” said Parvatamma. “Where will you find silence?” Sringeri Srinivas simply frowned at her and started to walk away from his village.
Soon, he came close to a new town. He watched the noisy people in the noisy town. A young man passed by. He had some wires dangling from his ears. Sringeri Srinivas could also hear a ‘ting dang ting dang’ sound. The man looked very happy. He did not even notice that trucks were blaring horns nearby.
“What is this?” he asked the man.“Theseare my headphones. Here, try them on,” the young man said. He put themon for Sringeri Srinivas. Music! Ting dang ting dang. No horns. “Aha! This is just what I need,” he said.
Sringeri Srinivas went into the town. He bought a pair of the best headphones and put them on. At last... no more noise! He returned to his village, with his big new headphones.
His wife was happy to see him. Sringeri Srinivas gave her a big smile. His children helped him to connect the new headphones to some good, happy music.
Now, when Sringeri Srinivas gets very angry at the cars or even at the frogs, he puts on his headphones and listens to the silence. Or he listens to good music. In the village, the cows are mooing again. The koyals have come back. Ribbit ribbit, go the frogs. Kirkk kirkk, sing the cicadas.
But the cars on the highway are still making too much noise.Paoon! Ponn! Paaa! It is not a good sound. Sringeri Srinivas has to take his cows to the fair soon. Will they want headphones too?

I like playing with my friend Chuma.
We are good friends. When either one of us is sent somewhere, we go together.
One day, my grandmother sent me to the shop to buy salt and cooking oil. I went with Chuma.
On the way, we saw our friends playing football.
"Ah! Football!" I said. I wanted to play too.
I said to Chuma, "Let's ask if we can play with them. I like playing football very much."
Chuma replied, "Let us go to the shop first, then we can come to play."
But I replied, "Let us play first! Grandmother will not allow us to return."
We joined our friends to play. I was the goal keeper. The goal posts were made of two big stones.
I worked hard to catch the ball. My friends were not able to score any goals.
We played until the field was full of sand.
Then we went to the shop. Grandmother's money was gone! I started to cry. Chuma shouted, "Stop crying. You wanted to play first."
We returned home without salt or cooking oil. We were very dirty and worried.
Grandmother was annoyed when we got home. The first question she asked us was, "Where were you all this time?"
We had to tell her the truth. She warned, "You should never go to play without permission."
We went to feed the ducks.  Later on, we cleaned ourselves.

#6FrameStoryChallenge: A Carnival of ArtThe illustrations in this book were created as part of the #6FrameStoryChallenge, an online campaign run by Pratham Books to build a rich bank of illustrations for StoryWeaver. The essence of the #6FrameStoryChallenge was to tell a good story using just 6 illustrations.  The campaign inspired nearly 70 illustrators to donate their time and skills to India’s first open-source story-publishing platform for children. What started out as an experimental campaign soon blossomed into a carnival of art, birthing nearly 500 new illustrations.These wordless narratives cut across language barriers, opening up a world of possibilities, encouraging StoryWeaver’s growing community to dream up multiple stories around these images. The #6FrameStoryChallenge is a powerful reminder of the need for collaboration, to get closer to our mission: “A Book in Every Child’s Hand.”

वाघमारे काकाचा तो वार्षिक केशकर्तन दिवस होता.   It was the Annual Haircut Day for Waghmare Kaka.
वाघमारे काका न्हाव्याकडे जाण्यासाठी घरात निघाले. Waghmare Kaka left home to go to the barber.
पण न्हावी म्हणाला, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.''But the barber said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
वाघमारे काका दुःखी झाले. ते मदत मागण्यासाठी आपल्या बायको कडे गेले.Waghmare Kaka felt sad. He went to his wife to ask for help.
पण त्यांची बायको म्हणाली, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.''   But his wife said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
थोडा रागवून, वाघमारे काका आपल्या शिंपी मित्राकडे गेले. Feeling a little angry, Waghmare Kaka went to his friend, the tailor.
पण शिंपी म्हणाला, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.'' But the tailor said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
वाघमारे काका आणखी एका मित्राकडे गेले, सुताराकडे. Waghmare Kaka went to one more friend, the carpenter.
पण सुतार म्हणाला, ''एवढे लांब केस कापण्यासाठी आज मला वेळ नाही.'' But the carpenter said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”
बिचारे वाघमारे काका. वार्षिक केशकर्तन दिवशी त्यांचे केस कोणीच कापू शकणार नव्हते. Poor Waghmare Kaka. No one could cut his hair on this Annual             Haircut Day.
रडत रडत,  ते गावाजवळच्या जंगलात पोहोचले. Crying, he went to the forest near the village.
ते एका गुहेजवळ बसून जोरात रडायला लागले. He sat near a cave and cried loudly.
''देवा, मदत कर! कोण माझे केस कापतील?'' “Oh God, help me! Who will cut my hair?”
गुहेत शांतपणे झोपलेला वाघ त्याच्या आवाजाने जागा झाला. The tiger sleeping peacefully inside the cave was awake now.
ते वाघ जोराने गरजला आणि वाघमारे काकांवर उडी मारली!  The tiger roared loudly and jumped on Waghmare Kaka!
बिचारे वाघमारे काका इतके घाबरले, इतके घाबरले, इतके घाबरले  की ... Poor Waghmare Kaka was so scared, so scared, so scared that ...
... त्यांच्या डोक्यावरचे सगळेच केस गळून पडले! ... all the hair fell off his head!
वाघमारे काका धावत गावात आले. वाघ पुन्हा झोपायला गेला.Waghmare Kaka ran all the way back to the village.                                   The tiger went back to sleep.
आता वाघमारे काकाला खूप दिवस केस कापण्याची गरज येणारच नाही. Now, Waghmare Kaka will not need a haircut for a very long time.

When I was five years old, Uncle Wanga gave me a wonderful present. It was a three-week-old puppy! The day Uncle Wanga brought the puppy home, I was very happy. I knew I had a friend.
After putting him down, Uncle turned to me and asked, "What name will you give him?" I looked at my puppy, and said, "Coco." Uncle was surprised. He asked, "Why do you call him Coco?" I said, "Because he looks like cocoa."
I asked my uncle if Coco was born alone. My uncle said that there was another puppy, exactly like Coco. I went to see Coco's brother.
When Coco saw his brother, he was very excited. The two of them put their heads together as if they were talking.
I asked my uncle if I could keep both Coco and his brother. "All right," he said. "But you must look after them." So every evening, I played with them and took them for exercise.
A few months later, Coco and his brother were big, strong and healthy. They were too big for me to look after on my own.
So I asked my uncle to take back Coco's brother. But when Coco was left alone, he looked very sad. It felt as if he was asking me, "Why did you do that?"
He stopped playing. Sometimes he refused to go for a walk with me. There were times when Coco ate very little. I was worried. I asked myself, "What can I do to help Coco?"
Behind the kitchen, dancing happily before me were Coco and his brother!
I was so happy that I did not know who to hug first, Coco or my uncle. I knew Coco would go back to his old self now that his brother was back. We would go running in the fields again!
On a bright sunny day, a fawn was racing in a forest.
On his way he met a rabbit, he ran past the fast runner.
Next, he met an elephant and he ran past the huge animal too.
Then came a stream, he leapt and cleared the stream feeling refreshed with the fresh and cool water.
He was still full of energy, so he ran past the crumbling wall too.
He was sure that he is going to win the race and in his excitement he missed a large boulder on the grassy plain. He stumbled and fell down.
He got hurt in his leg and was bleeding. He burst into tears.
Hearing his cry a monkey came and massaged his aching leg and the tears flowed from the fawn's eyes.
Brother bear also came and picked him up but the fawn didn't stop crying
Mama dear came running to her baby and said, "Look we'll beat up this bad boulder!"
The fawn forgot his pain and stood up and said, "Oh, don't do that or he will also start crying." His mother laughed and hugged him. So did the fawn.
In the busy city,  far away from a caring life at home,  lived a group of homeless boys. They welcomed each day just as it came. On one morning,  the boys were packing their mats after sleeping on cold pavements. To chase away the cold they lit a fire. Among the group of boys was Magozwe. He was the youngest.
When Magozwe's parents died,  he was only five years old. He went to live with his uncle. This man did not care about the child. He did not give Magozwe enough food. He made the boy do a lot of hard work.
If Magozwe complained or questioned,  his uncle beat him. When Magozwe asked if he could go to school,  his uncle beat him and said,  "You're too stupid to learn anything." After three years of this treatment Magozwe ran away from his uncle. He started living on the street.
Street life was difficult and most of the boys struggled daily just to get food. Sometimes they were arrested,  sometimes they were beaten. When they were sick,  there was no one to help. The boys survived from begging, and selling plastics and other recycling.
One day while Magozwe was looking through the dustbins,  he found an old tattered storybook. He cleaned the dirt from it and put it in his sack. Every day after that he would take out the book and look at the pictures. He did not know how to read the words.
The pictures told the story of a boy who grew up to be a pilot. Magozwe would daydream of being a pilot. Sometimes,  he imagined that he was the boy in the story.
It was cold and Magozwe was standing on the road begging. A man walked up to him. "Hello,  I'm Thomas. I work at a place where you can get something to eat," he said. Thomas pointed to a house nearby. "I hope you will go there to get some food?" he asked. Magozwe looked at the man,  and then at the house. "Maybe," he said,  and walked away.
Over the months that followed,  the homeless boys got used to seeing Thomas around. He liked to talk to people,  especially people living on the streets. Thomas listened to the stories of people's lives. He was patient and respectful. Some of the boys started going to the yellow house to get food.
Magozwe was sitting on the pavement looking at his picture book when Thomas sat down next to him. "What is the story about?" asked Thomas. "It's about a boy who becomes a pilot," replied Magozwe. "What's the boy's name?" asked Thomas. "I don't know,  I can't read," said Magozwe.
When they met,  Magozwe began to tell his own story to Thomas. It was the story of his uncle and why he ran away. Thomas didn't talk a lot,  and he didn't tell Magozwe what to do,  but he always listened carefully.
Around Magozwe's tenth birthday,  Thomas gave him a new storybook. It was a story about a village boy who grew up to be a famous soccer player. Thomas read that story to Magozwe many times,  until one day he said,  "I think it's time you went to school and learned to read. What do you think?" Thomas explained that he knew of a place where children could stay,  and go to school.
Magozwe thought about this new place,  and about going to school. What if his uncle was right and he was too stupid to learn anything? What if they beat him at this new place? He was afraid. "Maybe it is better to stay living on the street," he thought.
He shared his fears with Thomas. Over time the man reassured the boy that life could be better at the new place.
And so Magozwe moved into a house and shared the room with two other boys. There were ten children living at that house. Along with Auntie Cissy and her husband,  three dogs,  a cat,  and an old goat.
Magozwe started school and it was difficult. He had a lot to catch up. Sometimes he wanted to give up. But he thought about the pilot and the soccer player in the storybooks. Like them,  he did not give up.
Magozwe was sitting in the yard at the house where he stayed,  reading a storybook from school. Thomas came up and sat next to him. "What is the story about?" asked Thomas. "It's about a boy who becomes a teacher," replied Magozwe. "What's the boy's name?" asked Thomas. "His name is Magozwe," said Magozwe with a smile.
Chicken and Millipede were friends. But they were always competing. One day, they decided to play football to see who was the best player.
They went to the football field and started their game. Chicken was fast, but Millipede was faster. Chicken kicked far, but Millipede kicked further. Chicken started to feel angry.
They decided to play a penalty shoot-out. First Millipede was goal keeper. Chicken scored only one goal. Then it was Chicken's turn to defend the goal.
Millipede kicked the ball and scored. Millipede dribbled the ball and scored. Millipede headed the ball and scored. Millipede scored five goals!
Chicken was furious that she lost. She was a very bad loser. Millipede started laughing because his friend was making such a fuss.
Chicken was so angry that she opened her beak wide and swallowed Millipede.
As Chicken was walking home, she met Mother Millipede. Mother Millipede asked, "Have you seen my child?" Chicken didn't say anything. Mother Millipede was worried.
Then Mother Millipede heard a tiny voice. "Help me mom!" cried the voice. Mother Millipede looked around and listened carefully. The voice came from inside the chicken.
Mother Millipede shouted, "Use your special power my child!" Millipedes can make a bad smell and a terrible taste. Chicken began to feel ill.
Chicken burped. Then she swallowed and spat. Then she sneezed and coughed. And coughed. Millipede tasted disgusting!
Chicken coughed until she coughed out Millipede. Mother Millipede and her child crawled up a tree to hide.
From that time, all chickens and millipedes were enemies.
It is Rani's first day at school.Her mother is holding her hand and walking her to school."I am grown up now", Rani says to her mother. "Let go my hand, let go!"Her mother holds her hand even more tightly.
There were many children reaching the school already.Some children came by bus, by car, some by rickshaw, cycle.And some came by walking, just like Rani.
Rani and her mother reached the school gate, and her mother let go off her hand.Her mother stays at the gate. Now Rani has to go inside alone.There are many new faces all around her.

Meera and I are a team. She’s my most favourite person in the world. Do you know why? She’s the only one who can see me!
Everything she likes, I like. Everything I like, she likes. Our names also sound the same. Meera and Ameera!
Things that happen to her happen to me too. “I lost another tooth,” Meera says. While I lost another quill.
Sometimes, we can be a little different. Meera makes up problems. I make them go away.
Like the other day when it was raining—“Oh no, now we can’t go out to play,” Meera cried.
But I had an idea! Off we sailed on a paper boat.
Or the time when she started school.“What if I don’t make any friends?” Meera was worried.“You made friends with me. Now go make one more friend,” I told her.
It’s my turn to tell the story now. Ameera is my most favourite person in the world. Do you know why? She turns stuff upside down, just so I have a different view.
Ameera never lets me walk into a fight alone. Even though she doesn’t help much.
She makes every day a BIG adventure. Like the time we had to get out of a murukku maze. “I know! Let’s eat our way out,” Ameera said.
Like Ameera said, we’re a team.

He loves food, but he is too lazy to cook.
"Yes. Help me with stirring," says Rabbit. But Anansi is lazy.
Anansi ties some web around his leg and to Rabbit's pot.
"Monkeys, can I share your beans?" "Yes. Help us with chopping."
"Warthog, can I share your potatoes?" "Yes. Help me with preparing."
Soon,  each of Anansi's 8 legs is tied to a pot.
All 8 legs are being pulled! "Stop pulling!" cries Anansi.
Anansi's legs stretched! And so all spiders have long thin legs.
Sonu wore a blue shirt after his bath. Monu and Rina wore blue socks.

A long time ago, three girls went out to collect wood.
It was a hot day so they went down to the river to swim. They played and splashed and swam in the water.
Suddenly, they realised that it was late. They hurried back to the village.
When they were nearly home, Nozibele put her hand to her neck. She had forgotten her necklace! "Please come back with me!" she begged her friends. But her friends said it was too late.
Nozibele went back to the river alone. She found her necklace and began hurrying home. But, she got lost in the dark.
In the distance she saw light coming from a hut. She walked quickly towards it and knocked at the door.
To her surprise, a dog opened the door and said, "What do you want?" "I'm lost and I need a place to sleep," said Nozibele. "Come in, or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele went in.
The dog said, "Cook for me!" "But I've never cooked for a dog before," Nozibele answered. "Cook, or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele cooked some food for the dog.
Then the dog said, "Make the bed for  me!" Nozibele answered, "I've never made a bed for a dog." "Make the bed, or I'll bite you!" the dog said. Nozibele made the bed.
Every day she had to cook and sweep and wash for the dog. Then one day the dog said, "Nozibele, today I have to visit some friends. Sweep the house, cook the food and wash my things before I come back."
As soon as the dog had gone, Nozibele took three hairs from her head. She put one hair under the bed, one behind the door, and one in the kraal. Then she ran home as fast as she could.
When the dog came back, he looked for Nozibele. "Nozibele, where are you?" he shouted. "I'm here, under the bed," said the first hair. "I'm here, behind the door," said the second hair. "I'm here, in the kraal," said the third hair.
The dog knew that Nozibele had tricked him. He ran and ran all the way to the village. But Nozibele's brothers were waiting there with big sticks. The dog turned and ran away and has never been seen since.

I love water.
I enjoy playingwith water.
It is raining.
Rain gives uswater.
I enjoy playingoutside.
But it israining.
I enjoy playing out in the rain.
My hair is wetfrom playing in the rain. My father is fixing my hair.
I wonder ifthere's another me somewhere in the world.
Who looks thesame.
And talks thesame.
And even has mycurls.
Someone with myeyes my ears.
Who even has mylaugh.
Who can do what Ican do.
And can't do whatI can't.
I've looked andlooked everywhere to find another me. I went down to the park and looked behindthe trees.
I looked around,up and down.
At every singleface.
I couldn't find anotherme in any single place.
There's only oneme in the world! I'm special, oh it's true!
But not just me,don't you see? There's only one of you!
For the very first time, Maaloo is collecting vegetables from the garden. He has collected red tomatoes, fresh brinjals and green lady's fingers.
Dadi says, “Well done, Maaloo! Go and get some potatoes too.”
Maaloo looked at all the trees, creepers and plants. Not a single potato could he see.
“Dadi, the potatoes aren’t ready yet,” said Maaloo, putting the empty basket down. “No Maaloo, there are plenty of potatoes. Look carefully,” said Dadi.
Maaloo went into the garden once more. Kaaloo followed him. Maaloo was looking for potatoes when he heard, “Woof! Woof!”
“Kaaloo! Stop, Kaaloo!” yelled Maaloo, running behind him. “Don’t spoil the garden.” Maaloo saw that Kaaloo was digging away and what do you think was coming out of the mud?Big fat potatoes!
“Well done, Kaaloo. You found the potatoes!” laughed Maaloo, filling his basket with potatoes.
The wind roars. It roars past our home.
The wind is powerful. It tears my kite from my hand.
I run after my kite. The wind blows me away from the kite!
The wind becomesa tornado. It carries my kite higher and higher.
The tornado swallows me up! I see nothing, I touch nothing.
Where is my kite now? Perhaps it is caught in a tree.
Perhaps my kite is still flying in the sky.
The wind finally dies down. I am still spinning.
When I stop spinning I look around. Where did the wind go?
I cannot see my kite anywhere. I cannot hear the wind anymore.
Perhaps tomorrowI will find my kite.
Now, I must go home, before the wind starts to roar again.
Tenzin and Tashi were two young Tibetan monks. They lived in a small monastery on a beautiful green hill. Here, it was lovely when it rained.When Tashi looked out of the window late one morning, the rain was coming down hard. Rivulets were forming where the water had made paths on the muddy road. Tashi couldn’t think of a better way to spend the afternoon than sailing paper boats.Tashi and Tenzin set about making many paper boats. As soon as it stopped raining, the boys ran outside. They sailed the paper boats they had made – some big, some small. The boats floated nicely along the path. The two young monks were happy.
As they trotted back home, they saw Gen Lobsang. Genla lived in the monastery and told the children the most wonderful stories. “Genla,” shouted Tenzin. “Can you tell us a story about why boats float?” Gen Lobsang thought for a minute and said, “I don’t know why boats – or ships, for that matter – float. But I am curious to find out.”Genla: A polite way of addressing the teacher in Tibetan
Genla and the children decided to go and ask Miss Sonam, the science teacher, if she knew why boats float. Tenzin and Tashi gently pulled Gen Lobsang from his chair. They held his hands to help him walk. When they reached her room, Miss Sonam was reading a book. “Tashi delek,” said Genla, Tashi and Tenzin. “Tashi delek,” she replied.“We have a question for you,” said Genla. Tashi delek: A common Tibetan greeting; tashi means ‘good fortune’ and delek means ‘well being’.
“Yes, can you tell us what makes boats float on water, Miss?” Tenzin asked.“I can,” said Miss Sonam. “Or maybe we can find out together?”Before they knew it, Miss Sonam was giving instructions. “Tenzin, please bring a plastic basin from the kitchen.”“Tashi, please fetch a small bucket of water.”“Genla, hold this apple. Please don’t eat it.”
Miss Sonam asked Tashi to fill the tub to the brim. “Now, Genla,” she said, “dip the apple in the tub, please. Enough to cover it completely in water.”
Genla gently dropped the fruit into the tub and pushed it down with his little finger. Some water spilled. Tashi and Tenzin shrieked, “The water is overflowing!”Genla let go of the apple, and it rose up.Miss Sonam was smiling. “What happened here?” she asked.
“Genla pushed the apple into the water,” said Tenzin. “Water spilled,” said Tashi. “The apple’s floating,” said Genla.“Correct answers, all of you!” said Miss Sonam. “Now, can you tell me how much water spilled, Tenzin? Was it about half a cup? One cup?”
Tenzin looked at the water on the table and on the floor. He said, “Maybe one cup.”“That sounds right,” said Miss Sonam. Genla and Tashi nodded in agreement. “Now, take the apple out. Tashi, fill up the tub again. Here, Tenzin. Will you drop this spoon into the water?”Tenzin did. The spoon sank to the bottom.“Too heavy,” said Genla.“Not as heavy as a ship in the sea,” said Tenzin.“Very little water spilled this time, not even a quarter of a cup!” said Tashi, a little sad. “Again, you’re all correct,” said Miss Sonam.
Then she asked: “Do you see? After Genla dropped the apple into the water, the apple pushed some water away before it could float.”“Is that the water that spilled?” asked Tenzin.“Yes. So the apple could float because it pushed away more water than its own weight. That means, the apple is lighter than the water it pushed away.”“What about the spoon then?” Genla said.“Well, the spoon also pushed some water away. But much less. Certainly less than its own weight. So it sank.”
“What about large ships in the sea, on which there are many people?” asked Tenzin.  “...and many spoons that sink?” added Tashi. “The spoons won’t make a ship sink, Tashi. The ship is big enough to push away a lot of water. Again, like the apple, more water than its own weight. You don’t notice it because  in the ocean, there is so much water. The ship is still lighter than the amount of water that it pushes away.” They were all quiet for a bit. “I think I understand,” said Tenzin, slowly.
“Can we sail some boats now?” asked Tashi.“It’s time for my tea,” said Genla. Miss Sonam smiled. “Yes, enjoy yourselves!” she said, and gave the boys colour paper to make boats.
Tenzin and Tashi made more colourful boats and set them down in the water. “I don’t see any water spilling now,” said Tashi. “No, silly. The water doesn’t always spill. It just gets pushed away,” replied Tenzin. “I think the boats just make some space for themselves in the stream,” said Genla. They watched the blue and yellow boats, red and green boats, and white boats sailing. Like prayer flags floating in the stream.
What is Gravity?What would happen if Tenzin dropped a football from the top of a tree? Would it fall to the ground or rise towards the sky? That’s right, it would fall because of a force called gravity. Did you know that everything gets pulled towards the earth by that force?
What is Buoyancy?What would happen if Tashi dropped a football into a bucket of water? Would gravity pull the football to the bottom of the bucket? Yes, but in water, there is an upward force that opposes gravity. It is called buoyancy. As gravity tries to pull the football down, buoyancy tries to push it up. In the case of the football, buoyancy is stronger than gravity. So it floats. What would happen if he drops a brick into the bucket? Why?
What is Displacement?When you drop an object into water, it tries to make space for itself by pushing some water aside. In other words, the object displaces water to make space for itself. Bigger objects, like a basketball, displace more water than smaller ones, like a cricket ball. A long time ago, a Greek scientist named Archimedes discovered that when the weight of the water displaced by an object is more than the weight of the object, it floats. That is why apples float in water. Can you guess why other objects sink?
What is Density?Every object around us is made of tiny particles that can’t be seen with the naked eye. Density is how closely these particles are packed in an object. The weight of Tashi’s small glass marble may be the same as Miss Sonam’s apple. But why is the apple bigger? Because there is more space between the particles in the apple. In the marble, the particles are much closer to each other. An apple is less dense than a marble. Generally, dense objects sink in water. Here’s a game you can play with your friends: Pick four or five objects. Guess which ones will float and which will sink. Then drop them into a bucket or tub of water to check. Have fun!
Tall like a treeShort like grass
Up in the sky is a cloudDown in the soil is an earthworm
Light like a petal Heavy like a rock
Over the leaf is a caterpillarUnder the leaf is a dragonfly

Birds before sunriseBats after sunset
Above the tree is the moonBelow the tree is you!
For many months, the skies were dry. Lomongin, the famous rain-maker, talked to his gods. People gathered outside his home, anxiously waiting for a message of hope.
When he came out, he assured people that the creator was going to give them rain soon. They would be able to plant their crops.
Children played outside as we waited for the rains. Later that day, we saw big white clouds in the far east. I knew they were rain clouds.
People were still thinking about what the rain-maker said. Mother shouted loudly, "There! The clouds are now dark. Come inside."
The rain poured down.
We had waited for the rains! At first we rejoiced. But the rains did not stop.
There was water everywhere. The bridge linking our village to the mainland was washed away.
Houses were washed away by floods. What was a blessing, was now a disaster for us.
Everybody had prepared for planting. But now they could not plant. People of my village had longed for rain but now they did not want it anymore. We had no bridge to cross on. Many had no homes.
And, we had another problem! We saw crocodiles swimming everywhere. This had never happened before. We were confused.
We could not go shopping because all the shops were across the river. Children couldn't go to school because schools were across the river.
What should have been a blessing, became a curse to us. Lomongin, the rain-maker, was disappointed as well. The only one who was happy, was Kapuus with his eight cats!
Rabbit was sleeping under an apple tree. An apple fell down from a branch.
A voice said, "Run Rabbit run!" She woke up quickly and ran away with great speed.

Chicken was frightened. She started running when she heard what Rabbit said.
They met Dog. Dog asked, "Why are you running?" Chicken said, "I don't know. I just heard what Rabbit said, and she doesn't know. She heard something falling and a voice said, 'Run Rabbit run!'"
Dog was surprised about what she heard. She started running with Rabbit and Chicken.
They met Horse. Horse asked Dog, "Why are you running?" Dog said, "I don't know. I just heard what Chicken said, and she doesn't know. She heard what Rabbit said and she doesn't know. She heard something falling and a voice said, 'Run Rabbit run!'"
Horse started to run with the others.
They met Donkey. Donkey asked, "Why are you running?" Horse replied, "I don't know. I just heard what Dog said, and he doesn't know. He heard what Chicken said and she doesn't know. She heard what Rabbit said and she doesn't know. She heard something falling and a voice said, 'Run Rabbit run!'"
So Donkey starts running too.

He heard what Chicken said and she doesn't know. She heard what Rabbit  said and she doesn't know. She heard something falling and a voice said, 'Run rabbit run!'"
Cow was worried and starte to run as well.

She heard what Dog said and he doesn't know. He heard what Chicken said and she doesn't know. She heard what Rabbit said and she doesn't know. She heard something falling and a voice said, 'Run rabbit run!'"
Cat started running with the other animals.
Then they met the boy riding the bicycle and he asked, "Why are you running?'' And the animals replied, "We don't know. We heard what Rabbit said and she doesn't know. She heard something falling and a voice said, 'Run rabbit run!'"
The boy laughed and said, "An apple fell off the tree because of the wind. I'm the one who said, 'Run Rabbit run!'"

Once upon a time, the land at Mwese Village was very fertile. People had no fear of pests such as monkeys and quails. There were plenty of wild fruits and other yummy grasses for them to eat. Mwese villagers were good farmers. They cultivated maize, groundnuts, paddy, beans, sweet potatoes and cassava.One year, there a drought. The crops withered. They did not harvest as much as they did in other years.  Wild animals too suffered. They sought food and water. The monkeys invaded people’s farms and ate what little was there.The villagers had a difficult time keeping them off. They threw stones and arrows, but the monkeys refused to go away. They would simply hide nearby only to come out again when they saw there was no one around.Mzee Malele was the leader of Mwese Village. He called a meeting and said, “My brothers and sisters, we must now guard our crops in turns. We must do so during the day and the night.”
The villagers agreed. The timetable was drawn. Each had his or her turn. Only the children, the elderly, and the sick were excused. Whoever was on duty had to be fully armed.The monkeys knew that it was not going to be easy for them. People were guarding everywhere to stop the monkeys from invading their farms. The monkeys thought they were now going to die of hunger. They called a meeting to discuss on what to do.After long discussions, they decided that one of the monkeys should chop off his tail. The others then could him dress him like a man and send him to ask for the job of guarding the crops.The monkeys knew their monkey-in-disguise that would have to allow the other monkeys to come and eat. So, they chose one who would undertake this task. The one they chose was most courageous.They cut off his tail. In two weeks’ time, the wound had healed. They called him Mr. Maseleni. They helped him dress up. It was difficult to differentiate him from human beings. Mr. Maseleni vowed that he would help his fellow monkeys.Soon, he was ready to go and ask to become a guard. Mr. Maseleni met a group of villagers on their way to guard duty.
He introduced himself, “I am from Mapori Village. I’m looking for a job guarding farms.”The villagers directed him to the village chief’s house.At the village, Mr. Maseleni met with the chief. Chief Jumbe summoned a village council. They discussed the new application.After a long discussion, it was agreed that Mr. Maseleni should be given the job. It was also decided that he would live at the chief’s home.
Mr. Maseleni began his job immediately. He did well at first. When the monkeys came, he chased them away fiercely. Now that he could eat, Mr. Maseleni was not keeping his promise! When his fellow monkeys ran and jumped on tree branches, he beat them mercilessly.The villagers took to liking Mr. Maseleni. They decided to raise his salary.The monkeys stopped coming to the farms. They were afraid that Mr. Maseleni would catch them and beat them up. They became weak with hunger.As their condition worsened, they called a meeting.At the meeting, they decided to secretly send another monkey to Mwese Village. This monkey could reach out to Mr. Maseleni to remind him of his promise.They also sent the message that if he did not to honour his promise, they would give him back his tail.When Mr. Maseleni got the message, he pretended not to understand.“Go, tell them, they don’t know me. I don’t know them. I’m not a monkey. I’m the chief guard here.”The messenger went back to the other monkeys. The monkeys thought that they would die of hunger. So, they decided to find a way of sending Mr. Maseleni his tail.
On the following day, the monkeys started their journey to Mwese Village.The villagers woke up to the noise of the monkeys. When they came out of their houses, they were greeted by dust. Some monkeys were dancing, others were singing:Mr. MaseleniLet’s give him his tail back!Let's give him his tail back!Ti-tit-iiii! Ti-tit-iii!Let’s give him his tail back!Let's give him his tail back!When the villagers heard the message in the song, they were surprised. When Mr. Maseleni heard the song, he knew that his days were numbered. The villagers headed to the village chief, where the monkeys were also heading . Every villager came out with a weapon.They threw the arrows at the monkeys. But Chief Jumbe stopped them and said, “Leave them. It appears they have a message. If they cause any trouble, then we’ll attack them.”The leader of the monkeys came forward. He said, “We’ve come to hand back Mr. Maseleni his tail. He is one of us. We had turned him to look like a human being so that he would help us steal the maize.”“But, he has not honoured his promise. Each time he sees us, he chases us away. He beats us mercilessly,” said the leader.Chief Jumbe and all who were around were surprised. He decided that Mr. Maseleni be brought forward. When asked, Mr. Maseleni had no explanation. He stared at the ground.
Then, suddenly, the monkey who was carrying the tail jumped. He pushed the tail into Mr. Maseleni’s back and it stuck there. Immediately the monkeys took away Mr. Maseleni.The villagers heard Mr. Maseleni crying for help. He begged the monkeys not to turn him into a monkey again. They dragged him to the forest.The villagers were surprised.They were happy that their maize was ready for harvesting. They no longer feared the monkeys. Mwese villagers no longer wanted to hire someone from outside their village.Chief Jumbe issued a directive that all visitors must be checked well.This helped to note all who were good and those who were bad. The chief also wanted them to harvest their maize together.
From that day on, every villager took turns in guarding the crops. The children from Mwese Village even started a game for evening time. They sang about Mr. Maseleni.Let’s give him his tail back!Let's give him his tail back!Ti-tit-iiii! Ti-tit-iii!Let’s give him his tail back!Let's give him his tail back!Then they would give someone a tail made of rope.
The monkeys went to the forest along with Mr. Maseleni. They gave him the punishment to guard all the other monkeys. To this day, whenever there is a group of monkeys one stays back in the trees to watch out for danger.Whenever, there is a danger coming, the guard notifies them and the other monkeys can run away.Some monkeys call this guard Mr. Maseleni.

Rinky loves her elder brother’s handwriting. He writes with a very special shiny ink pen.
One day, when Bhaiya is not at home, Rinky looks for his pen. She slides open his drawer.
Out go his books!Out goes a stapler!Out goes a metal ruler!
At the bottom of the drawer, Rinky finds his special pen.But what’s that? A strange black block is stuck to it.
Rinky pulls the pen and the block apart.But then…Plink, click! A bottle-cap jumps and sticks to the block! Rinky giggles with delight.Can things stick to this block like magic?
Does the stapler stick to this block?Plink, click! Yes, it sticks.                                           Does the furry cat stick to it?No, it does not.
Does the metal ruler stick to this block?Plink, click! Yes, it sticks.
Does this hairy brown coconut stick to it?No, it does not.
The hairy coconut tickles Rinky’s nose.AH-CHOO! She sneezes loudly.The pen flies out of her hand and disappears under the bed.Rinky is worried. Bhaiya will be back soon!
She sticks her hand under the bed.Oh no! She can’t reach the pen.
She tries to reach the pen with the ruler.Oh no! The pen slides further away.If only there was a way to bring the pen closer to her.
Suddenly, Rinky has an idea.The best idea ever!
Rinky brings the black block near the ruler.Plink, click! It sticks!She then holds the ruler under the bed and stretches her hand.Stretch, stretch, stretch...
Plink, click! Guess what sticks to the block?
Quick! Quick! Bhaiya will be home soon.In go the pen and the black block. In go the books and stapler. In goes the metal ruler. Rinky slides the drawer shut.
Just in time! She hears the door slam, and Bhaiya walks into the room. “Rinky,” says Bhaiya, “Why is there a coconut on the floor?”
The Secret of the Magic BlockThe magic block in the story is called a bar magnet. Magnets come in many shapes. They can be round, rectangular, square or U-shaped.A magnet cannot stick to all objects. It can only stick to certain objects that have special elements in them. These special elements that allow an object to stick to a magnet are iron, nickel, steel and cobalt.
Which of these do you think will stick to a magnet?
There was only one bus in Ebei's village. It was big and blue. It was very noisy.
“Tomorrow we will go to town,” said Ebei's mother. “We will buy your school uniform.”
Ebei was very excited. They would travel in the big blue bus. He could not sleep that night.
When his mother came to wake him, Ebei was already dressed.
Ebei and his mother walked to the bus stop. They waited for the big blue bus. But the bus did not come.
Other people arrived at the bus stop. They complained because the bus was late. “Where is the bus?” they asked.
Ebei was worried. “We will not be able to go to town,” he thought. “I will not be able to get my uniform.”
Some people gave up and went home. Ebei cried. He did not want to go. “We will wait a bit longer,” said his mother.
Suddenly, they heard a noise. They saw dust in the air. The bus was coming!
But this bus was not blue. It was not big. It was red and small. The people did not want to get in this bus.
“Get in! Get in!” shouted the driver. “We are very late today,” he called.
Ebei and his mother got in first. Soon everyone else got in the small red bus.
Ebei looked out the window. He saw more people at the bus stop.
Even more people were running to catch the bus. But they were too late. The red bus was full. It left for town.
“Where is the big blue bus?” asked Ebei's mother. “It broke down,” replied the driver. “We are fixing it. It will come tomorrow.”
Ebei did not care about the colour of the bus. He did not care about the size. This bus was going to town!

Who looks  the same. THINK ABOUT THE FOLLOWINGWhen you look in a mirror, or a reflective surface like this  water, you see a reflection of your image. An image that has one side that looks like the reflection  of the other side is said to be symmetric. Most people's faces are very close to being symmetric. Do you see some things in your room that are symmetric?
And  talks  the  same. ACTIVITIESThis animal is listening to its echo across a canyon.  Have you ever been someplace where you can hear  an echo? Does your echo sound exactly like you, or is it different somehow?
who even has curls just like mine. ACTIVITIESThe hippo and the mouse both have a tail that is  curled, but they are certainly not the same as our friend. Describe some ways that those two animals are  different from our friend. Pick someone you know, and describe some ways that you are similar to them and different from them.
Someone with eyes and ears like mine. ACTIVITIESThis animal has 3 eyelashes on each side. How many eyelashes is that all together?
Who even laughs just like me. MORE ACTIVITIES TO DOCan you make sounds like some of the animals?  Can you neigh like a horse?Oink like a pig?Meow like a cat, or bray like a donkey?
Who can do what I can do.....THINGS YOUR CHILD DOESThey are so happy running along together. Do you feel happy when you are running freely in a big open  space like that? Do you prefer to run with someone or by yourself? They are running by some rocks. How many rocks are there? There are two big rocks near the path. If you take the big rocks away, how many rocks are left?
...and can't do what I can't do.DIFFICULT THINGS TO DOWhy are the animals having trouble peeling a banana?  Can you peel a banana easily? Are there things, such as fruit or packages, that you  have trouble opening?
I've looked and looked everywhere to find another  me. I went down to the park and looked behind the  trees. THINGS THAT YOUR CHILD WONDERS ABOUTWhat animal did he see when he looked behind the tree? Why was it another animal just like him? Is that what he was looking for?
I looked up and down, left and right and all around.WHAT DOES YOUR CHILD THINK?That first picture is just silly. How would that animal  ever climb to the top of a tree? Do you think the bird is surprised to see it there?
I looked at every animal I found.CAN YOUR CHILD ADD NUMBERS?There are three animals on one side of the pond and  one more on the other side.  If you put them all together, how many animals are there at the pond? Similarly, if you remove the one animal on one side of the pond from the group of four animals that are  at the pond, how many animals are left?The two facts – that 3 + 1 = 4 and 4  – 1 =  3 – are tied together and are called a math fact family.
I couldn't find anywhere, anybody who looked just like me.WHAT DOES YOUR CHILD THINK?Do you think his shadow temporarily fooled him into thinking that there was another animal just like him?Does your shadow look like you? Have you ever seen someone's shadow and thought  that the shadow was really a person?
There's only one me in the world! I am very special you see.DIFFERENCES IN ANIMALSHow many animals can you count in this picture?Describe some of the ways that each one of them is different from our friend.
But I am not the only special one. There is only one of you too!EACH PERSON IS UNIQUEDo you know someone who is very similar to you? Perhaps they are the same age or the same height,  or perhaps their hair is similar to yours.  Despite the similarities, they are probably not exactly the same as you.
Once upon a time, there lived three cats in one house. Their names were Black Cat, Blue Cat and Green Cat.
Every evening after dinner, Blue Cat would bake three loaves of bread.The next morning, all of the cats would have bread, milk and porridge for breakfast.
One morning, they could only find two loaves of bread!
The next morning, another loaf was gone! “What should we do?” they wondered. “There must be a thief.”
“Let’s take turns all night to guard the loaves,” suggested Black Cat.
But they ate so much that night that they all fell asleep. Nobody guarded the bread.
The same thing happened the next night. Again, they decided to take turns in guarding the bread, and again, they all fell asleep!This went on for a long time and the thief remained uncaught.
One day, Black Cat was cleaning and oh! He saw a small hole under the bed.“Who dug this hole?” he wondered.
“Come look!” he called to the other cats. “I think the thief comes in through this hole.”“We must catch him!” they cried together.
That evening, Blue Cat baked three loaves of bread. Then, all three cats hid inside the room.
Late at night, a big yellow rat emerged from the hole. It quietly scampered towards the table where the bread loaves were.
Just then, the cats jumped out of their hiding places.“CAUGHT YOU!” they yelled. “Give us back our bread!”They put the rat on the table and demanded an explanation. Its eyes widened with fear.
“I'm very sick and can't buy any food,” the rat told them. “My kids are hungry and I need this bread to feed them.”
The rat showed his children to the cats.They were very weak and sad.
The next day, Blue Cat baked many large loaves of bread. He baked enough for all of the cats, the rat and his children.The cats and the rats ate merrily ever after.

Malela village was surrounded by hills. Many snakes lived in the forest on those hills. The biggest snake was called python by the villagers. Python scared many people. It swallowed whole goats and sheep.
One day, three sisters, Mutale, Mutinta and Mabvuto went to the forest to fetch firewood. The girls' grandmother warned, "Beware of Python the big snake. Do not take anything from the forest except the wood."  Only Ajoh did not pay attention to her grandmother.
The girls packed milk, bananas, sweet potatoes and water. They took ropes for tying firewood and a sharp dagga for chopping the wood. Then they left for the forest.
On the way, the sisters chatted and laughed. Suddenly,  Mutale, the eldest of them, said, "Be quiet. We are coming to where Unyalego the snake lives."
Mabvuto called to the others, "Look, here are Python's golden teeth. Let us take them."  Mutale reminded them, "Don't forget grandmother's warning. We must not take anything from the forest except firewood."
Mutinta said, "I don't trust grandmother. She said that to stop us having what we want. I want the golden teeth." Her sisters were worried, but Mutinta did not care.
At that moment Python came looking for his golden teeth. He was furious when he could not find the teeth. Then python heard the girls chatting and laughing. He hid under a rock next to the road where the girls would pass on their way back.
The sisters were going home carrying their firewood. Suddenly, they heard, "Hssssss!" There was Python with his mouth wide open, ready to bite. The girls were terrified.
Python asked the girls, "Who took my golden teeth?" No one answered. Python decided to test the girls. "Whoever is innocent,  will be able to sing well. She will go home with her wood. But the guilty one will sing badly. And I will eat her!"
Mutale started to sing with a clear voice, "It was not me,  it was not me who took the teeth. The one who took is still behind." Then Mabvuto sang the song. She also sang well.
Lastly, it was Mutinta's turn. She was scared. She started singing. It  sounded terrible and the words were wrong. Python shouted, "Can't you sing properly like the others?" Python knew that Mutinta took his golden teeth.
Python opened his huge jaws and swallowed Mutinta. Her sisters ran back to the village. They told everyone the story of what happened. "I warned her, if only she had listened," the girls' grandmother said sadly.
'Wov! What a lovely raincoat!' Mannu danced happily holding the shining red raincoat that his parents had bought for him.'Mamma, may I wear the raincoat now?' Manu asked his mother.Mamma said, 'No, my child. You can wear it when it rains. It should start raining soon. But as of now I don't see any signs of the rain.'
But, Monday was a bright sunny day, full of golden sunshine.Mannu looked out of the window every now and then and asked his mother,'Mamma, will it rain today?'Mamma  peeped out of the window and said, ' I don't think it will rain today. You cannot wear the raincoat today. People will laugh at you, if you do.'
On Tuesday also Mannu kept looking at the sky. And the raincoat was kept right next to him, ready to be used. But the sky was a nice blue and as bright as it was on Monday.Mannu was disappointed,'Mamma, when will I be able to use the raincoat?''There is just a single cloud in the sky today, and that too a white one. I don't think you will get a chance to wear the raincoat today.'Mamma said.
Wednesday again was a very hot sunny day.Mannu was getting worried, 'Mamma, why is it not raining yet?'He tried to put the raincoat on at home. But had to immediately take it off because he felt too hot in it.Mamma, in her eagerness to comfort him said, 'I think it will rain soon, probably by afternoon.'
On Thursday, there was the school picnic. Mannu was eager to show off the raincoat to his school buddies.'Mamma, shall I carry the raincoat to the picnic. What if it rains there?' Mannu asked.'Don't, my pet. It will not rain today. See those white clouds? And they are also so far away.' Mamma tried to comfort him.
And... at last  on Friday, the sky looked quite dark with black clouds. Mannu kept the raincoat ready at hand.'Mamma, it will rain today, right mamma?' Mannu asked excitedly. The peacock also seemed to think so and started dancing. The tortoise came out of it's hiding and looked up at the sky hoping perhaps to feel cooler after the hot summer.'I think so. Today the sky is full of black clouds.' Mamma smiled at Mannu's excitement and was happy for him.
On the Saturday morning there was a loud thunder.  And also lightening.'Mamma, it that not lightening? Now it will surely rain, right Mamma?' asked Manu.He ran out on the lawns and saw that a frog and a tortoise also had come out of their hiding.
And.. tip...tap...tip...tap... came down the raindrops!Mannu, loved the rains...raincoat or no raincoat.'Oh, it is raining; it is raining.' Thus shouting  Mannu ran out of the house and started  jumping and dancing in the rain. And he had the company of the frog who also seemed to be  waiting for the rains.
'Wait Mannu, wait.' Mamma ran after him with his raincoat in her hand. 'You forgot your raincoat!'But Mannu was very happy getting drenched in rains. The raincoat which he was holding close to himself all this time was all forgotten.
Long long ago when the earth was new, great mountains covered the world like a blanket, and tall trees spiked the sky.
In this world, there was a deep dark pool, silent and cold.
At the bottom of this pool were two snakes. One had thick strongly patterned coils, and the other was smaller and more delicate.
Then one day, there was a great storm. A flash of lightning pierced right to the bottom of the pool. The waters parted for a moment. The snakes saw the earth above, full of colours and shapes and feathered creatures. When the waters closed again, the snakes could not forget the beauty they had seen.
"We cannot stay in this dark cold pool any longer," they said to each other. "Let us go up and see the earth above." "How will we live on earth?" said the smaller snake. "Will we crawl on our bellies?"
"The birds of the air will not laugh at us for being so low," said her friend. "We will not crawl, we will walk!" Very slowly the snakes uncoiled themselves. Close together they began to swim up, up, to the light above.
And as they reached the surface of the water, a strange thing happened. The tips of their tails split into two. They grew limbs with feet and toes. From just beneath their heads grew two arms with hands and fingers.
They were no longer snakes, but Man and Woman.
"We will make our home in the hills," said Woman. "Each morning we will see the sun rise and feel it warm on our backs." "We will look after the grass and the trees," said Man. "And be friends with Bird and Beast."
"Come," said First Man. "I will," said First Woman. And they walked out together into their new world.
Mama K has been harvesting cabbages all week. Doobie, Maya and Duksie help Mama K in her vegetable garden on Saturday mornings. Today the children are going to help with counting and packing the cabbages. Then Baba K will take boxes of cabbages to sell at the market.
The taxi drops off the children at the garden gate. They can seethe huge heap of cabbages piled up near Baba K's old truck. "Yo! What a lot of cabbages!" says Maya pointing."There must be a thousand cabbages there!" laughs Duksie. "No way! Two hundred at the most!" disagrees Doobie.
Mama K is waiting at the gate. "Hello everyone, I'm happy to see you!" she greets the children. "Now let's get to work. You'll need to count the cabbages and put them into boxes, 12 cabbages in each box. I have 20 boxes. Two of you can each pack 7 boxes and one of you can pack 6 boxes."
The children stand around the pile of cabbages. They talk about different ways to count the cabbages. "I think I will count mine in 2s," Maya says."I like counting in 4s," says Duksie, "it's quicker." "I'm goingto count in 3s, just to be different!" pipes up Doobie.
Soon the children have filled 20 boxes. "Good work!" exclaims Mama K. "Look, there are some cabbages left over. My pigs love cabbages so let's share these with them," she suggests. "How many cabbages did youpack into boxes? How many cabbages were left over?" she asksthe children.
The next job is to write the price on each box and then help Baba K load the boxes on his truck. They must put half the boxes on one side of the truck and half on the other side, to balance the load.
"We're almost done!" says Baba K. "Let's see, how many more boxes we must still put on each side to balance the load?"
Soon all 20 boxes are loaded onto the truck. Baba K warms up the engine and drives off to market. "If I can sell all the boxes," he thinks to himself, "I'll have enough money to fix the pig pen andget a surprise forthe children!"
Back at the farm, Mama K and the children water plants and rake leaves. By twelve o'clock they are all tired. Mama K tells them, "It's time for your treat. Can you guess what I have for you today?"
She goes inside to fetch their surprise. The children wait patiently for her to return while they guess what shemight bring them. When she comes down the path her apron pockets are bulging!
"Let's see if you guessed right! What's in store for you today?" Mama K tips out her apron pockets and a pile of apples falls onto the table. "See, I was right!" Duksie squeals. Mama K tells the children, "Now remember the rule. Share fair! No one to get more or less than the other!"
First the children count the apples in 2s. They count: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 1 apple left over. Altogether there are 17 apples.
Next, they share out the apples equally. There are 2 apples left over. The children then put their apples in their bags to take home. How many does each child get?
"Let's cut the 2 apples to share between us," suggests Duksie. "How many parts of the apple will we each get?" asks Maya. "I know the answer!" smiles Doobie.
Just then Baba K arrives home from market. The truck is empty and Baba K is smiling. "I sold all the cabbages. Now I can fix the pig pen and buy you that soccer ball you wanted. "Yay!" shout the children."

It was a hot summer day in the dry forest.
Little Ant had no water for many days.
"I need a drop of water, even if it falls from a leaf," cried Little Ant.
But even the dew had dried up.
"If I do not have water, I will die," cried Little Ant. "I must go to the river I heard about."
"The river is full and strong. It will sweep you away," warned a wise squirrel.
But Little Ant was extremely thirsty. "I will die if I don't drink some water."
So, he went to look for the river.
He walked past tufts of grass and over dry branches.
He walked until he heard water splashing. It was the river! He could hear waves.
Little Ant took a long sip of cool water.
He was so happy he did not see a wave coming.
Little Ant tried to grab some grass floating past him. But he was swept away by the water.
"Help me someone. Help me please!" he called.
"Quick, climb on," said White Dove, holding a branch in her beak.
White Dove saved Little Ant from drowning in the river.
"I will stay here until I can thank the dove," decided Little Ant. "I will wait until she comes back to drink."
One day as he waited, two boys came to the river. They had their slingshots.
"There is a big white dove that comes here to drink," said one boy.
"Let's kill it and have it for supper tonight," said the other boy.
"I cannot let the boys kill White Dove," thought Little Ant. "But I am so tiny, what can I do?"
Just then White Dove flew down from the tree to drink.
The naughty boys got ready to shoot White Dove.
Little Ant had an idea.
Little Ant jumped onto one boy's foot. He bit that boy as hard as he could.
The boy jumped. "Ouch!" he shouted.
White Dove was startled and flew away to safety.
That was how Little Ant thanked White Dove for saving him.
Mother, Father and Laraba are talking about how to stay healthy.
Laraba asked at school, "Why must we wash our hands?"
Teacher said, "Our hands have germs on them, but you can't see germs."
"Germs are very tiny. We need a microscope to see them."
Laraba looked through the microscope.She saw the germs from her hand.
"Viruses and bacteria are types of germs.Germs can make us sick."
"Washing hands stops viruses and bacteria from spreading," said Teacher.
Father is making a tool for washing hands.
Laraba asks, "How does this tool work?"
"The wooden step tilts the container, and water flows out."
"Wash with soap and water. Slowly count to 20 while you wash."
"Clever Dad! Now, can you greet with your elbow?"

Long long ago people didn't know anything. They didn't know how to plant crops, or how to weave cloth, or how to make iron tools.The god Nyame up in the sky had all the wisdom of the world. He kept it safe in a clay pot.
One day, Nyame decided that he would give the pot of wisdom to Anansi. Every time Anansi looked in the clay pot, he learnedsomething new. It was so exciting!
Greedy Anansi thought, "I'll keep the pot safe at the top of a tall tree. Then I can have it all to myself!" He spun a long thread, wound it round the clay pot, and tied it to his stomach. He began to climb the tree. But it was hard climbing the tree with the pot bumping him in the knees all the time.
All the time Anansi's young son had been standing at the bottom of the tree watching. He said, "Wouldn't it be easier to climb if you tied the pot to your back instead?" Anansi tried tying the clay pot full of wisdom to his back, and it really was a lot easier.
In no time he reached the top of the tree. But then he stopped and thought, "I'm supposed to be the one with all the wisdom, and here my son was cleverer than me!" Anansi was so angry about this that he threw the clay pot down out of the tree.
It smashed into pieces on the ground. The wisdom was free for everyone to share.And that is how people learned to farm, to weavecloth, to make iron tools, and all the other things that people know how to do.
Sheep lived in the city. She got tired of city life and decided to go to the bush.On her way she met Hyena who had not eaten for many days.
She greeted Hyena over and over again, "Brother Hyena, how are you? Brother Hyena, how are you?"Hyena answered Sheep, "Don't greet me over and over. Do something to end my hunger."
When Sheep heard this, she started running. Suddenly, she reached Lion's den. Hyena was running after her. Hyena arrived at the den and finally stopped, throwing dust into Lion's eyes.
Lion said to Hyena, "Can't we even find peace in our dens? You throw dust into our eyes!" Hyena answered, "King, I did not mean to disrespect you! I am only running after my food!"
Lion said, "You are food to me, too, Hyena. Did I chase you? You came to me. Don't blame me later."
Then Lion said to Sheep, "Why did you come to the bush?" Sheep replied, "I came because I am a diviner."
Lion said, "Prepare traditional medicine to prove that you are truly a diviner." Sheep replied, "My medicine is expensive." Lion said, "That is no problem, whatever it costs. There is nothing that is impossible for me."
Sheep said, "The medicine is Hyena's ear." Lion cut off Hyena's ear and gave it to Sheep. Sheep put Hyena's ear inside a jar of honey and gave it to Lion.
Lion ate Hyena's ear and found it so sweet. He asked Sheep, "Is it possible for me to have the second ear?"
Sheep said, "Yes, it is possible my king." So Lion cut off Hyena's second ear and brought it to Sheep. Sheep put the ear inside a jar of honey and gave it to Lion.
Then Lion said to Sheep, "Is it possible to get the skin?" Sheep replied, "I think it is possible my king." When Hyena heard this he was afraid of dying, and ran. Lion ran after him.
"If such is life in the bush, then it is better for me to return home," said Sheep.
I am a big boy now.
I can climb up the steps.
But I cannot climb down again.
I can climb on a chair.
But I cannot climb down again.
I climb on to the chair, and then on the table!
But I cannot climb down again.
“Papa! Papa!” I shout. Papa laughs. “Sonu, learn to climb down!” he says.
I am afraid. But I do not cry.
Slowly, I get down from the table, and down from the chair.
At last, I have learnt to climb down too!
Once there was a very hungry crocodile.
He searched for food slowly and quietly.
POW! The crocodile strikes!
After that he is no longer hungry,  and he is happy.
Until he gets hungry again.
It's not easy being a tiger.Yes, tigers are beautiful and fierce.
But tigers are also big and heavy.This makes it difficult for them to hunt for food.
Out of every twenty times a tiger hunts,it eats only once.
When a tiger moves through the forest,KHAU! KHAU! KHAK!The langur calls, just like an old man coughing!KHAU! KHAU! KHAK!
AWOOOO! HAWOOOO!The barking deer calls, like a scared dog!AWOOOO! HAWOOOO!
OOW! OOW! OOW!The spotted deer calls, like a little bird!OOW! OOW! OOW!
The whole forest knows the tiger is here!AHUUUN? AHUUUN?The tiger wonders, where has everyone gone?
Ape meets Crocodile by the lake.
"Where do you live?" asks Ape,  "In the lake," says Crocodile.
"Where do you live?" asks Crocodile. "In the trees," says Ape.
"Can you swim?" asks Crocodile.
"I cannot swim," says Ape. "I can teach you."
"We are friends. Do not be afraid," says Crocodile.
"Ape,  my uncle is sick. He needs meat," says Crocodile.
Ape is very afraid. Will Crocodile eat her?
Ape wants to escape from Crocodile.
Ape has an idea.
"I will give you my heart for him," Ape promises.
"My heart is in a tree on the land," says Ape.
"Will you fetch your heart?" asks Crocodile. "Yes," says Ape.
Crocodile swims back to the land. Ape runs to the trees.
"You are not my friend. You lied!" says Crocodile.
"We are not friends. You want to eat me!" says Ape.

“I cannot let the boys kill White Dove,” thought Little Ant. “But I am so tiny, what can I do?”
Just then White Dove flew down from the tree to drink.
Little Ant had an idea.
He jumped onto one boy's foot. Little Ant bit that boy as hard as he could.
The boy jumped. “Ouch!” he shouted.
White Dove was startled and flew away to safety.
That was how Little Ant thanked White Dove for saving him.
“La-la,la, la, la, la, la…”
“Is it from somewhere?” “Is it from everywhere?”“It is from there!”
“La-la,la, la, la, la, la…”
“Is it from the sky?”“Is it from the tree?”“It is from the bush!”
“La-la, la, la, la, la, la…”
“Is it black?”“Is it white?”“It is brown!”
“La-la, la, la, la, la, laa …”
“Is it a prayer?”“Is it a poem?”“It is a song!”
“Is it a koyal?”“Is it a myna?”“It is a…”
“La-la, la, la, la, la, la…”
“It is a donkey!”“It is a donkey!”“It is a donkey, sing on!”

In a village, there was a young boy whose name was Abula. He did not like to read or even to open a book. He was a lazy pupil. He behaved badly.
Abula stole his mother's money to buy sweets. Even when she hid her money, he found it and took it.After eating all his sweets, Abula would play with his friends.
After a while, Abula stopped going to school. He stayed out playing the whole day, only returning home in the evening. Abula's mother noticed this and became worried.
"Our son is not behaving well. I do not think he is attending school. He is also stealing money from me," said Abula's mother.
He said to his wife, "Next time, hide the money within the pages of a book. He never even opens a book, so the money will be safe there."
The next day, Abula looked for his mother's money. He searched everywhere but he did not find anything. He decided to go to the nearest market to find some money.
His father saw where Abula was going. "My son, I know why you are going to the market. Now go back inside and look in the books for money," he said.
Abula was puzzled, but he went and searched in the books. He found the money that his mother had hidden.
The next day, he looked in the books again. But there was nothing hidden there. He went to his father to ask why there was no money in the books.
His father smiled and replied, "My son, do you want to get enough money to buy many sweets?"  Abula answered, "Of course, father."
His father said, "Listen to me carefully. Read your books and attend your classes. You will find rewards in books. Do not give up." "But father, reading is a difficult activity. Books are boring!" Abula replied.
For a while, Abula's father was quiet. He thought about how to encourage his son. Then he said to Abula, "Let us read together. I will help you to find the wealth in books."
Tamara was a five year-old girl who lived with her family. Their village was near a forest that had wild animals.
Tamara was obedient to her parents. She looked after sheep and goats.
Tamara loved listening to birds singing as she took care of theanimals. As the birds sang, she put her own words to the tune.
Tamara was too young for school. Her parents only allowed their older children, Nashipae and Tasieku, to go to school. It was 10 kilometres away.
Nashipae and Tasieku went with other children from the village in the morning and returned in the evening. They carried food in small containers.
Tamara asked her mother, “When will I go to school?” Her mother answered, “You go soon, my dear child.”
One day, a car arrived with the chief and two ladies. The chief made sure that children went to school at the right age.
People believed that if a child was able to stretch her hand over her head and touch the ear, she was ready to start school.
The chief asked, “How old are you?” Tamara replied, “I am five years old.” “Let's see if you can go to school,” the chief said.
One of the ladies took Tamara's right arm and gently placed it over her head. Tamara touched her left ear.
Tamara would go to a different school than Nashipae and Tasieku.It was new and closer to home.
Tamara was very happy.She thought, “I will read and write like Nashipae and Tasieku.”
My little brother sleeps late. I wake early,  because I am great!
I am the one who lets in the sun.
"You're my morning star," says Ma.
I wash myself every day,  I don't need any help.
I don't mind cold water, or the blue soap that washes clothes.
Ma reminds,  "Don't forget your teeth." I reply,  "Never,  not me!"
After washing,  I greet Grandpa and Auntie. I wish them a good day.
Then I dress myself.  "I'm big now, Ma," I say.
I can close my buttons and buckle my shoes.
I make sure my brother knows all the school news.
In class I do my best in every way.
I do all these good things every day. But the thing I like most,  is to play and play!
I love my teacher.
She is a good teacher. She is kind and patient.
She has braided her hair so nicely.
She has put colourful beads in her hair.
Her beads are green, white, red, and yellow.
Mom, please would you braid my hair like my teacher's?
When I am older I will put beads in my hair.
I will grow up to be just like my teacher!

Rana loved to watch the stars. She wanted to jump up to the sky and touch them all.Then one night, she decided to do something to reach them!
She climbed a large rock and got a little closer to the stars.But they were still out of her reach.The stars were SO far away!
Then, she climbed a taller mound. She stretched out her hands, but the stars were still out of her reach.
Then Rana saw a very tall coconut tree and thought: Ah, this will work!
She began to climb the tree with great difficulty.
She stretched out her hands ... but the stars were still out of her reach.
Rana was disappointed. She looked down and her heart skipped a beat in fear.
She put a hand to her heart and said to herself, "I won't be afraid. I can do it!"
﻿Then, Rana looked down again and could see a pond.The stars were shining in the water.
She saw the stars and rejoiced. Then she dove into the pond.
The closer she got to the pond, the closer she seemed to get to the stars.
SPLASH!Rana plunged into the water.
Then she got out of the pond and sat on the bank.
She sat and observed the stars shine in the pond.
There was a time when all the animals lived together as friends. One day they decided to have a meeting to elect a king.
Rooster wanted to be king. So he lied to the other animals. He told them, “The red comb on my head is fire! Don't touch the comb on my head!”
The other animals believed Rooster. They decided to elect Rooster as their king. The animals hoped that Rooster's fire would help them in cold weather.
Then came a day when it rained. And rained. And rained. It was cold. Everything was wet and cold.
“Where can we get fire to warm our bodies?” Rabbit asked the other animals.
“We can get fire from the comb on Rooster's head,” replied Monkey. “Rooster is our king because he has fire on his head,” said Monkey.
The animals agreed with Monkey. They sent Fox to collect fire from king Rooster.
Fox found Rooster in a deep sleep. So he decided to take fire without asking Rooster.
Fox collected some dry grass. He put the grass next to the comb on Rooster's head. Nothing happened. The grass did not catch fire.
“Wake up king Rooster!” yelled Fox. “We need fire now.”
But Rooster could not give fire to Fox.
Fox was angry. He went back to the other animals. He told them the truth about the comb on Rooster's head. From that day, no one was afraid of Rooster. And foxes eat roosters and their families.
Once upon a time, there lived two sisters, Nelima and Nambuya. Their parents were dead. They lived on bare land. There was neither rain nor crops. Whoever wanted food had to go a long distance to find it.
Nelima was a humble, quiet and helpful girl. Her sister Nambuya was proud and did not listen to advice. She did not care about other people.
One day, the two sisters had nothing to eat. They would have to look for food. So Nelima and Nambuya went off in different directions.
Meanwhile, there lived an old woman called Netasile. She was believed to be a giver of riches. Netasile had leprosy and her body was full of sores.
Nambuya came across Netasile. Netasile called the Nambuya, "My daughter, how are you? Where do you come from? Where are you going?"
Nambuya answered all the questions. Then the Netasile said, "Come help me to go to my house and I will tell you what to do."
Nambuya was rude to the woman. She said, "I would rather die than touch those sores of yours." Netasile kept quiet and wished Nambuya a safe journey.
Nambuya walked for a long time. She reached a place where there were snakes, millipedes, caterpillars and other insects. She was very tired and weak from hunger. When she sat down to rest, she fell asleep. The insects began to bite her.
On her journey, Nelima came to the same old woman. She was happy to see Netasile, who was the first person she met since starting her journey. Netasile asked the same questions as she asked Nambuya.
Nelima agreed to help Netasile. "You have done what others failed to do," said the old woman. She told Nelima to go back home. There she would find everything she wanted.
Nelima was very grateful and thanked the old woman. She ran back home and found a new house with everything in it, and a lot of food. She was now rich.
But Nelima mourned the loss of her sister, Nambuya. She said to herself, "One who did not listen to advice ended up in an elephant's mouth."

When the last school bell rang, all the children laughed and screamed with joy.                                                    All, except Akku. Akku was ANGRY!
"Akku! Akku! Look at the pretty sunflowers!" said Appa, as they rode   through a field."Oh no! They’re TOO YELLOW! They’re making my eyes hurt!" said Akku.
Akku! Akku! Look! Look at all the monkeys!" said Appa, pointing at the roof of their house.                              "oh no!" said Akku. Go AWAY!
"Here, drink some buttermilk," said Appa. "It’ll cool you down.""NO!" said Akku. "I DON’T WANT ANY!""Try a sip, at least?""OKAY! FINE!" said Akku, and tried a sip.It wasn’t all that bad.She had another sip.  And another.In no time, the glass was empty.
"Would you like a vada?" asked Appa.  "NO" said Akku."Just one little bite?""Okay, FINE!" said Akku, and took a bite. It  was quite good.She took another bite.And another.In no time, the plate was empty.
"Good girl," said Appa. "Now will you tell me why you’re so angry?"    "NO!" said Akku."Was it something I did?""NO!""Was it something Amma did?""NO!""Did something happened in school today?"     "MAYBE!"        "Oho."
"Would you like to draw it?" asked Appa. "Here’s a nice sheet of paper and some crayons."                                                                                                                                     "Okay, FINE!" said Akku.
Akku drew a brick… "This is the BRICK that I tripped over this morning," said Akku.                   "You’re right. That is a  brick!" said Appa.
And Akku drew a boy…"This is Bikku, The BOY who laughed at me when I fell down!" said Akku.                 "You’re right," said Appa. "He shouldn’t have laughed at you."
And Akku drew an idli…    "This is my idli," said Akku. "It fell out of my lunch box when I tripped over the BRICK!"
And Akku drew a crow…                                              "This is the CROW that flew off with my idli," said Akku.                              "The crow must have been very hungry," said Appa.
And Akku drew her teacher…"This is my teacher, Amala Miss," said Akku."She helped me up when I fell down. And then she hugged me.""That’s nice of her," said Appa."And then she patted my back and said, you would be fine. I DON’T like to be hugged and patted."Are you alright now?" I’m okay now."     "That’s good."
"See how well you draw, Akku?" said Appa."You’re a real artist! Will you draw something for Amma too?""Okay!" said Akku, and      started drawing some more. "This is a little white mouse… and this is a boat…and this is a coconut tree…"
"And this is a sunflower…and this is your cycle, Appa… and this is a dog…and this is a frog…"In no time, Akku had forgotten all about the BRICK that made her trip and fall. And about the BOY who laughed at her. And about the IDLI-CROW.And Akku even forgot about being ANGRY.

He lived in peace with all the other birds.But Tausi had a dream.
He wished he could see the all the beauty of nature for himself.
But Tausi, the Peacock couldn’t even travel far in search for food.Some naughty birds mocked him.They left him alone whenever they went in search of food.
Tausi the Peacock thought to himself, If I am a bird, then I should be able fly. Why don't I have wings like other birds?
Tausi the Peacock thought hard.He decided that he would try to collect feathers from other birds.He crept up behind the Owl.
He plucked a few feathers from her back without being noticed.The feathers were beautiful, long and dark.
He did the same with the Parrot. He got beautiful green and yellow feathers.
He stole feathers from many different birds. He even plucked feathers from Geese who were swimming in the river. The feathers were pretty and white.Tausi kept his feather-gathering a secret.
Tausi, the Peacock even stole feathers from two Eagles while they were busy eating!
By now he had collected a lot of beautiful feathers.He cleverly wove them together.
He carefully fixed the feathers to his tail. When he stretched his tail, the feathers spread out like a fan.It was beautiful. The different colours made him look even more attractive.
Now Tausi the Peacock was the most attractive bird in the village.None of the other birds had feathers as beautiful as Tausi, the Peacock.
Tausi the Peacock was happy. As the most beautiful bird in the jungle, he no longer wanted to fly.Other birds didn’t mock or tease him any more. They were too busy admiring his beauty!

“Do you have a sore throat?” her teacher asked her. Shanti shook her head.Her cheeks were red and it looked like she had a fever.“Are you feeling okay?” Sona Miss asked.Shanti nodded, still not daring to look up.
“Why does Shanti look so sad?”“Is your little brother okay?”“Is your puppy okay?”“Is your grandmother okay?”Shanti kept nodding her head to each of her friends. But she did not look up.
