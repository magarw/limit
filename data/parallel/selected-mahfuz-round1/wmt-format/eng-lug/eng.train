He invited friends and relatives to attend the marriage ceremony. Kato was very excited because he thought he was getting a helper.
Many things were brought for the bride and her groom. These were baskets of millet, mats, bananas,  groundnuts, and other gifts for the home.
The wedding function ended and all the visitors left for their homes. Kato was ready to start a new life with his wife and the dog.
The next day, Kato served sweet banana to his wife, but she refused to eat.
When Kato went out to hunt, the woman ate all the sweet bananas.
Kato came back from hunting and he was hungry. He asked for sweet bananas. His wife said that the dog had eaten them all!
The following day, Kato went to his farm. When he came home, he found that his wife had eaten all the meat. She did not even share with the dog.
Another day, Kato went to visit his friend and when he came back, the woman had eaten all the groundnuts. The basket was completely empty. Kato was annoyed with his new wife.
Kato thought, "Something is wrong with this woman." He decided to apply magic. He put milk in a magic pot, put the pot under the bed, and went out hunting.
The woman saw the pot, and that it was full of milk. At once, she picked up the pot and put it to her mouth. She drank all the milk while the dog watched her.
Unfortunately, the pot got stuck to her mouth. She tried to remove the pot but all in vain. She shouted, and jumped up and down. But the pot stayed stuck. The dog watched all this.
Then the dog ran off to find Kato. The dog barked and barked, and jumped up and down. Kato realised that something was wrong at home.
They ran home together. Kato was very surprised to find his wife with a pot stuck to her mouth. He looked at her and wondered.
Kato touched his wife's cheek and the pot dropped down at once. The woman was very ashamed. She decided to go back to her parents' home.

His hoe was too short.
His doorway was too low.
His bed was too short.
His bicycle was too short.
This man was too tall!
He made a very long hoe handle.
He made very high door frames.
He made a very long bed.
He bought a very high bicycle.
He sat on a very high chair. He ate with a very long fork.
He left his house and lived in a big forest. He lived for many years.
In Miwa Forest, there lived a monkey who was always sad. This was because every time she had a baby, it died.
The pain of losing her babies made Monkey jump up and down. She would jump to one branch, then to another, and cry out, "Kwi! Kwi! Kwi!"
Monkey was sadder when she saw other monkeys with their babies.
The sad monkey sat on a branch. Days passed and she cried more and more.
Then she gave birth again. She decided to take the baby to the path.She wanted people passing by, to see the baby and wish it well.
Monkey put her baby on the path. At that time, a hunter was returning home. He saw the baby monkey lying on the side of the path.
The hunter carried the baby monkey to his house. When the hunter reached home, his three sons wanted to hold the baby monkey.
The boys sang: Throw it up! Throw it down! Throw it to me! Throw it to him! The baby monkey was thrown from one child to the other.
Mother Monkey hid in a tree and watched them. She was afraid that this baby would also die, like the others.
Then the hunter's wife saw her children playing with the little monkey. She said, "Be careful! Bring it here. You will drop it!"
She took the baby monkey in her arms, and blessed it.
The hunter's wife put the baby monkey down. Mother Monkey picked the baby up and disappeared into the forest. Mother Monkey never lost another baby from then on.

Era uma vez, um homem rico que tinha dois filhos. O homem rico escreveu em seu testamento que o primeiro filho ficaria com todas as suas vacas. E só um galo deveria ir para o seu segundo filho.
Então, depois que o homem morreu, seu primeiro filho ganhou todas as vacas. E o segundo filho só recebeu um galo.
Depois de um tempo, o filho rico ficou doente. Ele foi ao curandeiro para perguntar o que ele deveria fazer para melhorar. O curandeiro disse, "Você deveria abater um galo de uma cor especial."
O filho rico não sabia onde conseguir um galo de uma cor especial. Então ele lembrou do galo de seu irmão. Ele mandou algumas pessoas ao seu irmão.
O irmão disse a eles, "Tudo que eu tenho é este galo. Mas se ele pode fazer meu irmão melhorar, prefiro perder o galo." Ele generosamente deu o galo.
As pessoas o abateram e deram de comer para o irmão doente. O irmão se recuperou de sua doença.
Depois de um tempo a coisa mais curiosa aconteceu. No corpo do irmão rico começou a crescer penas.
Ele não podia acreditar no que estava vendo.
Ele foi aos anciões. Eles disseram, "Esse é o resultado de ter sido injusto com seu irmão. Você pegou todas as vacas e o galo que seu pai deixou para ele." Os anciões disseram ao irmão, "Para melhorar seu irmão deve perdoá-lo."
Os anciões continuaram, "Vamos pegar esta pulseira como um sinal de perdão e dar a seu irmão. Se ele cuspir nela, você será curado."
Os anciãos levaram a pulseira para o irmão e disseram, "Cuspa nela e perdoe seu irmão." O irmão cuspiu na pulseira.
Como resultado, os anciões decidiram dar metade das vacas do irmão rico para o irmão pobre.
One day,  Rabbit was walking by the riverside.
Hippo was there too,  going for a stroll and eating some nice green grass.
Hippo didn't see that Rabbit was there and she accidentally stepped on Rabbit's foot. Rabbit started screaming at Hippo,  "You Hippo! Can't you see that you're stepping on my foot?"
Hippo apologised to Rabbit,  "I'm so sorry. I didn't see you. Please forgive me!" But Rabbit wouldn't listen and he shouted at Hippo,  "You did that on purpose! Someday,  you'll see! You're going to pay!"
Rabbit went to find Fire and said,  "Go,  burn Hippo when she comes out of the water to eat grass. She stepped on me!"  Fire answered,  "No problem,  Rabbit,  my friend. I'll do just what you ask."
Later,  Hippo was eating grass far from the river when,  "Whoosh!" Fire burst into flame. The flames began to burn Hippo's hair.
Hippo started to cry and ran for the water. All her hair was burned off by the fire. Hippo kept crying,  "My hair has burned in the fire! My hair is all gone! My beautiful hair!"
Rabbit was happy that Hippo's hair was burned. And to this day,  for fear of fire,  the hippo never goes far from the water.

Once upon a time the rabbit was a great friend of the monkey.
One day the rabbit said,  "Let's go for a walk and look for something to eat." The monkey agreed,  but it was a trap for him!
They went to a field of maize and started to eat it.
But the clever rabbit had spoken to the owners of the farm,  to catch the monkey and show him he was foolish.
The clever rabbit started shouting,  "Robbers! Robbers! Your maize is all gone!" And he jumped up and ran away.
Suddenly the owners appeared and found the monkey trying to run away. But he has a long tail and it was stopping him.
The owners followed him,  shouting,  "Stop! Stop! We saw you,  you are the monkey."
But they caught him and started beating him.
He couldn't stand the pain so he said,  "I was with my friend Rabbit. He is the one who invited me."
But the owners cut his tail off and told him,  "Go and tell your friend that we cut off your tail!"
Then they went to the rabbit's house and cooked the monkey's tail to eat. The rabbit invited the monkey for lunch.
At the end of the meal the rabbit asked the monkey if he knew what he had eaten. The foolish monkey answered,  "No I don't!"
The rabbit told him that he had eaten his own tail and then ran away. And from then on they became enemies!

She flew across the sea to church.
She flew along the beach and saw people kissing.
She flew up to get coconuts from trees.
People paid her to help fix their roofs.
All her friends asked her how she did it.
"You have to think very, very hard," she said, "and you have to really really want to do it."
One day she met a boy who could fly too.
They started to go out together.
Maybe they got married and had children in the end.
Sherry has got very little hair. But she looks smart.

Mama K has been harvesting cabbages all week. Doobie,  Maya and Duksie help Mama K in her vegetable garden on Saturday mornings. Today the children are going to help with counting and packing the cabbages. Then Baba K will take boxes of cabbages to sell at the market.
The taxi drops off the children at the garden gate. They can see the huge heap of cabbages piled up near Baba K's old truck. "Yo! What a lot of cabbages!" says Maya pointing. "There must be a thousand cabbages there!" laughs Duksie. "No way! Two hundred at the most!" disagrees Doobie.
Mama K is waiting at the gate. "Hello everyone,  I'm happy to see you!" she greets the children. "Now let's get to work. You'll need to count the cabbages and put them into boxes,  12 cabbages in each box. I have 20 boxes. Two of you can each pack 7 boxes and one of you can pack 6 boxes."
The children stand around the pile of cabbages. They talk about different ways to count the cabbages. "I think I will count mine in 2s," Maya says. "I like counting in 4s," says Duksie,  "it's quicker."  "I'm going to count in 3s,  just to be different!" pipes up Doobie.
Soon the children have filled 20 boxes. "Good work!" exclaims Mama K. "Look,  there are some cabbages left over. My pigs love cabbages so let's share these with them," she suggests. "How many cabbages did you pack into boxes? How many cabbages were left over?" she asks the children.
The next job is to write the price on each box and then help Baba K load the boxes on his truck. They must put half the boxes on one side of the truck and half on the other side,  to balance the load.
"We're almost done!" says Baba K. "Let's see,  how many more boxes we must still put on each side to balance the load?"
Soon all 20 boxes are loaded onto the truck. Baba K warms up the engine and drives off to market. "If I can sell all the boxes," he thinks to himself,  "I'll have enough money to fix the pig pen and get a surprise for the children!"
Back at the farm,  Mama K and the children water plants and rake leaves. By twelve o'clock they are all tired. Mama K tells them,  "It's time for your treat. Can you guess what it I have for you today?"
She goes inside to fetch their surprise. The children wait patiently for her to return while they guess what she might bring them. When she comes down the path her apron pockets are bulging!
"Let's see if you guessed right! What's in store for you today?" Mama K tips out her apron pockets and a pile of yellow apples falls onto the table. "See,  I was right!" Duksie squeals. Mama K tells the children,  "Now remember the rule. Share fair! No one to get more or less than the other!"
First the children count the apples in 2s. The count: 2,  4,  6,  8,  10,  12,  14,  16,  and 1 apple left over, Altogether there are 17 apples.
Next,  they share out the apples equally. There are 2 apples left over. The children then put their apples in their bags to take home. How many does each child get?
"Let's cut the 2 apples to share between us," suggests Duksie. "How many parts of the apple will we each get?" asks Maya. "I know the answer!" smiles Doobie.
Just then Baba K arrives home from market. The truck is empty and Baba K is smiling. "I sold all the cabbages. Now I can fix the pig pen and buy you that soccer ball you wanted.  "Yay!" shout the children."
There was a time when all the animals lived together as friends. One day, they decided to have a meeting to elect a king.
Rooster wanted to be king. So he lied to the other animals. He told them, "The red comb on my head is fire! Don't touch the comb on my head!"
The other animals believed Rooster. They decided to elect Rooster as their king. The animals hoped that Rooster's fire would help them in cold weather.
Then came a day when it rained. And rained. And rained. It was cold. Everything was wet and cold.
"Where can we get fire to warm our bodies?" Rabbit asked the other animals.
"We can get fire from the comb on Rooster's head. Rooster is our king because he has fire on his head," said Monkey.
The animals agreed with Monkey. They sent Fox to collect fire from king Rooster.
Fox found Rooster in a deep sleep. So he decided to take fire without asking Rooster.
Fox collected some dry grass. He put the grass next to the comb on Rooster's head. Nothing happened. The grass did not catch fire.
"Wake up king Rooster!" yelled Fox. "We need fire now."
But Rooster could not give fire to Fox.Fox was angry.
Fox went back to the other animals. He told them the truth about the comb on Rooster's head. From that day, no one was afraid of Rooster.  And foxes eat roosters and their families.
Khayanga lived with her parents happily until they died when she was ten years old.
Khayanga was taken in by Rosa,  a distant relative. Rosa was kind to Khayanga, but she was old,  frail and poor.
Khayanga often visited her parents' graves to tell them of her misery.
One day when she visited, she received a gift. It was a very special Gourd which appeared from her parents' graves.
The Gourd sang a beautiful and soothing song. Khayanga recognised the voice as that of her late mother. It went like this.
Khayanga carried her special Gourd everywhere. With her Gourd, Khayanga felt her parents' presence and protection.
One day,  something bad happened to her special Gourd. It broke when she was fetching water in the river. Khayanga's heart broke as well.
Khayanga held the pieces of the broken Gourd in her small hands and sang:
Khayanga heard her mother's voice saying to her: "Our child,  pick up the pieces that are left. Fetch water with them and wash your feet. When you finish washing, close your eyes." Khayanga obeyed and suddenly, the broken Gourd became whole once again.
Khayanga continued to carry her Gourd everywhere she went. Wherever she passed, people whispered to each other, "What type of gourd is this?" With her special Gourd, Khayanga received everything she needed.
With the special Gourd, Khayanga knew that her parents were watching over her. Nothing bad could happen to her.
This is Azizi. Azizi is my doll.
I like Azizi because he always smiles.
After I wake up I wash my face. Then I look for Azizi.
When I find Azizi I brush his hair.
When I eat breakfast I feed Azizi.
When I eat sweets I give one to Azizi.
But Azizi never eats his sweet. I wonder why!
I walk around the compound picking flowers.
I give a flower to Azizi. But he never says,  "Thank you."
I wash Azizi clean before my mother bathes me.
I dress Azizi in red because I love the colour red.
When I go to sleep,  I lay Azizi beside me.

Flying across the morning sky,Are birds in a hungry mood.Spot the one who has caught,A yummy worm for its food!
Butterflies of different colours,Are flitting flower to flower.But there’s one that stands out,Because it’s one colour all over.
A cheerful bunch of kites,Is merrily hopping about.But one’s not quite the same,Can you find the odd one out?
Big and small squares,Are shapes you see everywhere.There’s one grill that’s different,Where is it hidden, here or there?
Look among the green leaves,Of this big, old tree.There’s a branch with a speck of colour,Wherever can it be?
Planes flying across the sky,Leave behind a straight trail.But one of them is rather odd,And instead makes a curvy tail.
A line of chattering birds,Are sitting above, can you see?But one likes to be quiet,Whichever could it be?
A flock of white clouds,Gleams on a bright summer day.But one decides to be rainy,And doesn’t care what the others say.
A long day is done,And the night has just begun.Of all the streetlights,Find one that shines like the sun.
Bats sleep when the sun is out,And wake when it's night.Can you find the odd one,Who is still sleeping tight?
Outer space has many planets,Shiny and brightly lit.Spot one that’s unique,Because it has a ring around it.
I see fire again.
The fire is burning brightly.
The fire can cook meat and vegetables.
The fire can keep me warm.
The orange light of the fire gives me light when it is dark.
The fire crackles and pops.
Fire is powerful and can be dangerous.
We must be careful when lighting fires or playing with fire.
Long ago,  there was no night in Opio's village. People slept when they were tired and worked when they were awake.
One day Opio went out hunting with his dogs. After a short time,  his dogs started to chase an antelope. Opio followed them. He ran for many hours. Every time he became tired,  he rested. Then he would run again. But he could not find his dogs.
After many days,  he came to a village. He went to one of the houses and said to the owner,  "I have chased an antelope for a long time and I am very tired. I want to rest." The man said,  "Sit down and rest. Would you like some beer?" Opio was very thirsty so he drank some. Then he went to sleep.
When he woke up,  he couldn't see. He opened and closed his eyes many times. "You have given me something very bad to drink," he said to the man. "I can't see properly anymore!" "There is nothing wrong with you," the man replied. "It's night now. Haven't you ever seen night? When the day leaves,  the night comes."
Opio asked many questions about the night. He began to like it very much. He and his new friend talked until morning. He stayed for another day so that he could see the night come again.
The next morning he asked his friend,  "How can I take the night to my own village? I want my people to see the night." The man explained,  "When it starts to get dark this evening,  walk to your village. If you look straight in front,  the night will follow you. If you look back,  the night will go away."
Opio did as he was told. That evening,  he began to walk towards his village. He felt the dark night behind him as he walked. He was tempted to look back,  but he did not.
When he came to his village,  the villagers were afraid. They asked Opio,  "What disease have you brought to us? What is this dark thing following you?" Opio said,  "My friends,  this dark thing is called night. You are afraid and I was afraid,  too."
Opio continued to explain,  "You will learn to like the night. When the light comes we can work and when night comes,  we can rest."
And that is how night came to Opio's village.
It is dry.
The sun is hot.
It is windy.
It is cloudy.
It is cold.
It is raining.
There is thunder.
I see a rainbow.
Once upon a time,  Hen and Eagle were friends. They lived in peace with all the other birds. None of them could fly.
One day,  there was famine in the land. Eagle had to walk very far to find food. She came back very tired. "There must be an easier way to travel!" said Eagle.
After a good night's sleep,  Hen had a brilliant idea. She began collecting the fallen feathers from all their bird friends. "Let's sew them together on top of our own feathers," she said. "Perhaps that will make it easier to travel."
Eagle was the only one in the village with a needle,  so she started sewing first. She made herself a pair of beautiful wings and flew high above Hen. Hen borrowed the needle but she soon got tired of sewing. She left the needle on the cupboard and went into the kitchen to prepare food for her children.
But the other birds had seen Eagle flying away. They asked Hen to lend them the needle to make wings for themselves too. Soon there were birds flying all over the sky.
When the last bird returned the borrowed needle,  Hen was not there. So her children took the needle and started playing with it. When they got tired of the game,  they left the needle in the sand.
Later that afternoon,  Eagle returned. She asked for the needle to fix some feathers that had loosened on her journey. Hen looked on the cupboard. She looked in the kitchen. She looked in the yard. But the needle was nowhere to be found.
"Just give me a day," Hen begged Eagle. "Then you can fix your wing and fly away to get food again." "Just one more day," said Eagle. "If you can't find the needle,  you'll have to give me one of your chicks as payment."
When Eagle came the next day,  she found Hen scratching in the sand,  but no needle. So Eagle flew down very fast and caught one of the chicks. She carried it away. Forever after that,  whenever Eagle appears,  she finds Hen scratching in the sand for the needle.
As the shadow of Eagle's wing falls on the ground,  Hen warns her chicks. "Get out of the bare and dry land." And they respond: "We are not fools. We will run."
Lynne, Oupa Karel and Anton were getting things ready for Lynne's birthday party.
Anton and Lynne are going to bake a cake. Oupa Karel reads the recipe.
"Let's mix these ingredients in the big bowl," said Lynne.
Anton stirred the ingredients and made a big mess.
"The cake feels heavy now," said Oupa Karel.
"Your friends have arrived," said Oupa Karel.
Anton thought the first present would be heavy because it was big.
It was a pillow and it weighed very little.
Anton thought the next present would be light because it was small.
It was a painted rock and it weighed a lot.
The children said that 1 kilogram of rocks weighs the same as 1 kilogram of feathers.
Lynne's cake was burnt.
Lynne was very sad.
Auntie Mavis asked Anton to guess how much her present weighed.
"It weighs the same as the cake that burned," said Anton.
Everyone said, "happy birthday, Lynne."

We reached the market. I saw a beautiful blue helicopter.
One stall had fruits. I asked mother, “Which ones are these?”
Mother said, “These are apples.” I begged, “Please, buy me one.”
I forgot my mother’s hand. I thought only of my apple.
When I finished eating, I was alone. I started to cry.
A woman took me where there were other children.
I thought children were sold at the market. I cried more.
A man asked, "Where is Zainab?"I hid away from him.
My mother's familiar voice called, "Zainab!" I was very happy.
My aunt pulled out a beautiful helicopter. "It's yours!" she said.

One day there was a great famine in the land. No one had anything to eat except the crows. Each morning they flew a long distance to where there was a tree with ripe figs in the middle of a wide river. Then they flew back with the figs for themselves and their relatives. The sight of so many figs made Anansi's mouth water. How could he get them for himself?
He thought of a plan. He carefully covered his bottom with sticky beeswax. Then he took a piece of clay pot and went to see the crows. “Please could you help me?” he asked. “I need a live coal to get my fire going again.” As they were getting the coal from the fire, Anansi carefully sat firmly on one of the largest figs, so that it would stick to his bottom. He thanked the crows, and hurried home to enjoy the fig.
But one fig wasn't enough for him. He went back a second time, and did the same. When he went back a third time, the crows began to get suspicious. “Why do you keep coming back to us to get a coal?” they said. Anansi answered, “Every time when I get home, the coal has burnt out.” “You're lying!” said the crows. “You just want our food!” “That's not true,” said Anansi. And he started crying.
The crows felt sorry for him. The next morning at first light, each crow gave him a feather. He flew with them to the fig tree in the middle of the wide river. When he saw the luscious figs, Anansi wanted them all for himself. Each time a crow tried to pick a fig, he shouted out, “That one is mine! I saw it first!” And then he took the fig and put it into his bag. Eventually he had all the figs and the crows had none.
He was left all alone as the darkness began to fall. “If I don't want to stay in this tree for the rest of my life,” he said to himself, “I'll just have to jump into the air like the crows.” So he took a deep breath, jumped, and PLOP! He fell into the river right among the crocodiles.
“What do we have here?” said a gruff crocodile voice. “A tasty morsel to eat, nyum”. “Oh please don't” said Anansi. And he began to cry. “I'm one of you, don't you know? I got lost in the days of your grandfathers and no one was able to find me. You're the first of my relatives I've ever met!” He cried so much that the crocodiles felt sorry for him.
The oldest crocodile said, “We'll know you're one of us if you can eat and enjoy mud soup just like we do.” They gave him a pot of dirty brown water. “Just like my grandmother used to make it!” Anansi said. But he made a hole in the ground with his back foot, and a hole in the pot with his front foot. As he pretended to drink the soup, it oozed down through the pot into the hole beneath his feet.
“Delicious!” he exclaimed, giving back the empty pot. "Now we know you are definitely one of us," the crocodiles said. So they allowed Anansi to sleep in their hole with them for the night. "Tomorrow morning I'll tell you the story of my life," said Anansi as they fell asleep.
Early the next morning, before first light, Anansi woke up one of the crocodiles. "I want to go and fetch my wife and children from across the river, so that they can help me tell my story. Will you help me before the others wake up?" he asked the crocodile.
The crocodile was grumpy at being woken up so early. “Please help me! You swim much faster than I do,” Anansi said. The crocodile agreed, and Anansi rode on his back to the bank of the river. He climbed off quickly. “I'll be back soon! Don't go away!” Anansi said, as he disappeared through the grass.
As far as we know, the crocodile is waiting for him still, with just his long snout and his beady eyes above the surface of the river.
I saw a big truck driving down the road.
A car came driving up the road.
The truck driver was talking on his cellphone.
He was not looking at the road.
There was a big accident.
An ambulance and the police came to help.
Two tow trucks came. They towed the truck and the car.
I was shocked.
An apple fell from a tree under which Rabbit was sleeping.
Rabbit heard a voice say, “Run Rabbit run!”
Rabbit told Chicken, “Something fell and I heard, ‘Run Rabbit run!'”
Chicken started running when she heard what Rabbit said.
They told Dog, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Dog started running with Rabbit and Chicken.
Dog told Horse, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Horse started to run with the others.
Donkey asked, “Why are you running?” Horse replied, “I don’t know.”
Donkey started running with them.
Donkey told Cow, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Cow was worried and started to run as well.
Cow told Cat, “Rabbit heard something falling and she ran.”
Cat started running with the other animals.
They met a boy. “Don’t you know what happened?” he asked.
“It was me who said, ‘Run Rabbit run!’” laughed the boy.
There was once a girl called Chikondi who lived with her parents near the village of Chionda. One day Chikondi's mother sent her to fetch water at the well.
On the way,  she met her friends. They were going to the forest to get firewood. Chikondi wanted to go with them. "Please wait for me under this  masuku tree!" she said,  "I have to fetch water for my mother." But her friends didn't want to wait.
"All right,  I'll catch up with you in the forest!" said Chikondi She ran off to fetch water and take it to her mother. Then she went to the forest to look for her friends.
She followed a path that led to a stream. On the other side of the stream were many tiny paths each one,  leading in a different direction. "Which path had her friends taken?" she wondered.
She chose the biggest path,  and walked and walked,  but she could not find her friends. She was so tired that when she sat under a tree to rest,  she fell fast asleep.
When Chikondi woke up,  it was dark. In the darkness,  yellow eyes were gleaming. She was surrounded by hyenas! She was too terrified even to cry out. She tried running,  but the hyenas circled her hungrily.
"Don't move," said the gruff voice of the biggest hyena. "If you run,  we'll eat you!" "Please let me go home!" Chikonde pleaded.
But instead the hyenas took Chikondi to their house in the forest. It was a dirty hut full of bones and buzzing flies. She lay down and pretended to go to sleep.
In the darkness,  she heard the hyenas talking to each other. "How is the fire doing?" one hyena asked. "Is the water boiling?" "Everything is ready," was the reply. "Should I bring her?" "Yes,  yes!" growled the other hyenas. "We're hungry!" They were ready to drag Chikondi out of the hut.
But the big hyena spoke,  "Hyenas,  wait. Remember the rule of the village. No hyena may eat alone. We have to invite the whole family to share a meal." "I'll go and call the in-laws," said his wife. "I'll go and fetch my cousins," said the small hyena. "I'll fetch our brothers and sisters," said another. "And I will remain here with our food," said the big hyena.
The big hyena sat in the doorway of the hut and the others went off in different directions. They took a long time,  and the big hyena began to doze in front of the warm fire. Soon he was snoring. This was Chikondi's chance! But how was she going to get past the hyena? He was so big he filled the whole doorway.
There was only one way. She took a flying leap right over the hyena's back,  and ran as fast as her legs could carry her.
Just then the other hyenas returned,  and saw what had happened. They ran after her,  howling with anger and disappointment. But it was too late.
As she came to her village,  one of the villagers recognised her and shouted,  "Chikondi,  "Chikondi is coming,  "Chikondi is coming." Her father and mother ran out to meet her. They hugged her,  while thanking God for saving their child,  ""Chikondi,  "Chikondi  we thought you had died!"
From that day,  "Chikondi and the other children never again went back to the forest alone.
A long time ago,  there lived a man called Mulongo and his wife Nambuya. They had two children,  Mukhwana and Namono. There was a famine in the land where they lived. All the villagers,  including Mulongo and his family,  would leave their homes early to look for food in the forest.
One day,  Mulongo,  his wife and children decided to go deep in the forest in search of something to eat. From morning to evening they looked for food but they found nothing. Nambuya urged her husband to go further into the forest. Mulongo led the way as Nambuya and the two children followed.
Suddenly Mulongo saw a beautiful banana plantation. He called his wife and said,  "Is that not a banana plantation? I can see bananas and other food crops. I wonder whose it is." They moved on and soon saw a house in the middle of the plantation. They stopped,  looked in all directions,  but there was no one around. Because they were hungry and it was nearly night time,  they decided to sit and wait for the owner.
Suddenly they heard heavy breathing close to the house. They were frightened to see a huge ogre arrive. "Who are you and what do you want?" asked the ogre in a fearful voice. Mulongo in a trembling voice said,  "We came looking for food because there is famine in our place." The ogre gave them food.
For several days the ogre allowed Mulongo and his family to eat his crops without asking for anything in return. One morning,  however,  the ogre said to Nambuya,  "I want you to cook your son for me to eat when I come back this evening." When the ogre had gone Mulongo went into the bush and killed some small animals,  which he asked his wife to cook for the ogre. Meanwhile he asked Mukhwana to climb up a leafy mango tree and hide.
In the evening the ogre returned and asked,  "Have you cooked Mukhwana for me?" Mulongo's wife answered,  "Yes." She gave the ogre the meat and he greedily ate everything. Then he said,  "Tomorrow you cook your daughter."
The following morning Mulongo and his wife did as they had done on the first day. Namono was hidden up the mango tree. When the ogre returned he said,  "Did you cook Namono?" Again,  Nambuya told the ogre that she had done so.
After eating,  the ogre instructed Nambuya to cook her husband Mulongo,  the next day. Nambuya was perturbed but Mulongo said he would go out again and catch some animals to cook. He did that and after giving the meat to his wife,  he also climbed up the mango tree to hide.
At dusk the ogre came back. Nambuya gave the meat to the ogre who enjoyed it very much. He told Nambuya,  "Tomorrow cook yourself." When the ogre had left Nambuya called her husband to advise her. Mulongo said,  "Go and look for some small animals and cook them for the ogre. When everything is ready,  come up the tree where we are."
The ogre came back in the afternoon and started eating his tasty evening meal of sweet meat. He felt sleepy,  went to lie under the mango tree and began snoring. But not so long after,  the ogre woke up because he heard noises above him. The ogre looked up to the tree and saw Mulongo and his wife and children.
The ogre was very angry. "So you deceived me? Let me come and get you," he shouted. As the ogre was struggling to climb up the tree,  Mulongo quickly thought of a trick and said,  "It will be easier for you to reach us if you tie a rope around your neck and we help to pull you up."
The ogre ran into the house,  brought a strong rope and after tying it around his neck he threw the other end of the rope to Mulongo. Mulongo and his wife and children started pulling the ogre up as they twisted the rope. The rope soon tightened around the ogre's neck until he could not breathe and died. Mulongo and his family came down the tree and took over the ogre's house and property.
Grandma's garden was wonderful. It was full of sorghum, millet, and cassava. But best of all were the bananas. Although Grandma had many grandchildren, I secretly knew that I was her favourite. She invited me often to her house. She also told me little secrets. But there was one secret she did not share with me. Where she ripened bananas.
One day I saw a big straw basket placed in the sun outside Grandma's house. When I asked what it was for, the only answer I got was, "It's my magic basket." Next to the basket, there were several banana leaves that Grandma turned from time to time. I was curious. "What are the leaves for, Grandma?" I asked. The only answer I got was, "They are my magic leaves."
It was so interesting watching Grandma, the bananas, the banana leaves and the big straw basket. But Grandma sent me off to my mother on an errand. "Grandma, please, let me watch as you prepare." "Don't be stubborn, child, do as you are told," she insisted. I took off running.
When I returned, Grandma was sitting outside but with neither the basket nor the bananas. "Grandma,  where is the basket, where are all the bananas, and where..." But the only answer I got was, "They are in my magic place." It was so disappointing!
Two days later, Grandma sent me to fetch her walking stick from her bedroom. As soon as I opened the door, I was welcomed by the strong smell of ripening bananas. In the inner room was grandma's big magic straw basket. It was well hidden by an old blanket. I lifted it and sniffed that glorious smell.
Grandma's voice startled me when she called, "What are you doing? Hurry up and bring me the stick." I hurried out with her walking stick. "What are you smiling about?" Grandma asked. Her question made me realise that I was still smiling at the discovery of her magic place.
The following day when Grandma came to visit my mother, I rushed to her house to check the bananas once more. There was a bunch of very ripe ones. I picked one and hid it in my dress. After covering the basket again, I went behind the house and quickly ate the banana. It was the sweetest banana I had ever tasted.
The following day, when Grandma was in the garden picking vegetables, I sneaked in and peered at the bananas. Nearly all were ripe. I couldn't help taking a bunch of four. As I tiptoed towards the door, I heard Grandma coughing outside. I just managed to hide the bananas under my dress and walked past her.
The following day was market day. Grandma woke up early. She always took ripe bananas and cassava to sell at the market. I did not hurry to visit her that day. But I could not avoid her for long.
Later that evening I was called by my mother and father, and Grandma. I knew why. That night as I lay down to sleep, I knew I could never steal again. Not from grandma, not from my parents, and certainly not from anyone else.
Monkey lived in a big tree on the bank of a river. In the middle of the river there was a small island. Lots of fruit trees grew on that island.
Monkey wanted to go and eat the fruit. He saw a big rock half way across the river and he thought he could jump onto the rock,  and then onto the island.
He jumped into the air and landed on the rock. He jumped again and reached the island. He enjoyed eating the fruit and then went back home. He did this several times.
But Crocodile lived in the river with his wife! The wife said,  "Dear husband,  you should go and lie on the rock. The colour of your skin matches the colour of the rock."
A few days later,  Crocodile saw Monkey coming onto the island. He quietly climbed over the rock and carefully lay down on it and kept his face underwater.
Monkey finished eating and was ready to go back. But the rock looked higher than usual,  so he spoke to the rock,  "Dear rock,  you seem to have grown. Are you all right?"
Crocodile was a fool and thought the rock must be a talking rock. So he answered Monkey and said,  "I look bigger because a big crocodile is lying on me."
Monkey said,  "Dear Crocodile,  I know you want to eat me. I am very old and you can have my body. But I must say goodbye to my children in that big tree." So Crocodile gave him a ride on his back!
As soon as they were there,  Monkey climbed the tree and said,  "Thank you for the ride,  my dear friend. Goodbye,  now you can go home!" But Crocodile said,  "But you promised."
Monkey laughed and said,  "What a fool you were to believe me!" and disappeared behind the branches of the tree. Crocodile never did catch clever Monkey!

One time, there was a great famine in the land. No one had anything to eat except the crows. Each morning they flew a long distance to where there was a tree with ripe figs in the middle of a wide river. They always flew back with the figs for themselves and their relatives. The sight of so many figs made Anansi's mouth water. How could he get them for himself?
He thought of a plan. He carefully covered his bottom with sticky beeswax. Then he took a piece of clay pot and went to see the crows. "Please could you help me?" he asked. "I need a live coal to get my fire going again." As they were getting the coal from the fire, Anansi carefully sat firmly on one of the largest figs. It stuck to his bottom. He thanked the crows, and hurried home to enjoy the fig.
But one fig wasn't enough for him. He went back a second time, and did the same. When he went back a third time, the crows began to get suspicious. "Why do you keep coming back to us to get a coal?" they said. Anansi answered, "Every time when I get home, the coal has burnt out." "You're lying!" said the crows. "You just want our food!" "That's not true," said Anansi. And he started crying.
The crows felt sorry for him. The next morning at first light, each crow gave him a feather. He flew with them to the fig tree in the middle of the wide river. When he saw the luscious figs, Anansi wanted them all for himself. Each time a crow tried to pick a fig, he shouted out, "That one is mine! I saw it first!" And then he took the fig and put it into his bag. Eventually he had all the figs and the crows had none.
He was left all alone as the darkness began to fall. "If I don't want to stay in this tree for the rest of my life," he said to himself, "I'll just have to jump into the air like the crows." So he took a deep breath, jumped, and PLOP! He fell into the river right among the crocodiles.
"What do we have here?" said a gruff crocodile voice. "A tasty morsel to eat." "Oh please don't," said Anansi. And he began to cry. "I'm one of you, don't you know? I got lost in the days of your grandfathers and no one was able to find me. You're the first of my relatives I've ever met!" He cried so much that the crocodiles felt sorry for him.
The oldest crocodile said, "We'll know you're one of us if you can eat and enjoy mud soup just like we do." They gave him a pot of dirty brown water. "Just like my grandmother used to make it!" Anansi said. But he made a hole in the ground with his back foot, and a hole in the pot with his front foot. As he pretended to drink the soup, it oozed down through the pot into the hole beneath his feet.
"Delicious!" he exclaimed, giving back the empty pot. "Now we know you are definitely one of us," the crocodiles said. So they allowed Anansi to sleep in their hole with them for the night. "Tomorrow morning I'll tell you the story of my life," said Anansi as they fell asleep.
Early the next morning, before first light, Anansi woke up one of the crocodiles. "I want to go and fetch my wife and children from across the river, so that they can help me tell my story. Will you help me before the others wake up?" he asked the crocodile.
The crocodile was grumpy at being woken up so early. "Please help me! You swim much faster than I do," Anansi said. The crocodile agreed, and Anansi rode on his back to the bank of the river. He climbed off quickly. "I'll be back soon! Don't go away!" Anansi said, as he disappeared through the grass.
As far as we know, the crocodile is waiting for him still, with just his long snout and his beady eyes above the surface of the river.
Long ago Lions did not have mane.So, Lions and Lionesses looked alike.
One day, a lion was hungry.He looked for food everywhere but did not find any food that day.He was very tired.He sat under an olive tree to rest for a while.
It was a windy day and one of the olives dropped down from the tree.It fell 'plop' on the lion's head, split open and rolled down.Lion was too hungry, he saw the olive and ate it up.
Wind blew harder, Olives kept plopping on the lion's head, rolled down and into his mouth.
Suddenly the lion saw a rabbit.He was still quite hungry and chased the rabbit.Rabbit ran for its dear life.
There was a patch of dry grass land nearby.Rabbit dived into the patch and ran zig-zag.Lion followed it, keeping his head down to spot the rabbit.Rabbit found a hole and went in for safety.
Lion couldn't find rabbit and came out of the patch, feeling exhausted.But oh! oh!.... what was there on his head?Lion felt something stuck up there. What?
Yes! the dry grass!Remember, olives plopping onto lion's head?The olives are very sticky inside. As if a tiny round bottle of glue!Lion didn't realise the olive glue was spreading on his head while plopping on.
And of course! the dry grass got stuck all over his head.Lion went straight to a water hole and had a look.Awww Awww Awww! He liked his new look!How splendid!
He showed his new look to all his friends, they loved it.From that day onward lions started keeping the hairy head look.And after many many years, they really grew hair over their heads.This hair is what we call Lion's Mane.

I have a friend. She lives in my house.
When I am happy, so is she.
When I cry, she cries too.
But I cannot hear her voice. My friend lives inside the mirror.
“Come out,” I tell her, “we will play.” She does not come out.
I am not happy. I go to sleep.
She comes out of the mirror in my sleep! And we have fun.
We play, we run, we shout and scream together.
When I talk to her, she also talks to me.
In the morning, my friend will go back into the mirror.
But I don't mind at all. We will play again in my dreams!

A long time ago,  three girls went out to collect wood.
It was a hot day so they went down to the river to swim. They played and splashed and swam in the water.
Suddenly,  they realised that it was late. They hurried back to the village.
When they were nearly home,  Nozibele put her hand to her neck. She had forgotten her necklace! "Please come back with me!" she begged her friends. But her friends said it was too late.
Nozibele went back to the river alone. She found her necklace and began hurrying home. But,  she got lost in the dark.
In the distance she saw light coming from a hut. She walked quickly towards it and knocked at the door.
To her surprise,  a dog opened the door and said,  "What do you want?" "I'm lost and I need a place to sleep," said Nozibele. "Come in,  or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele went in.
The dog said,  "Cook for me!" "But I've never cooked for a dog before," Nozibele answered. "Cook,  or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele cooked some food for the dog.
Then the dog said,  "Make the bed for me!" Nozibele answered,  "I've never made a bed for a dog." "Make the bed,  or I'll bite you!" the dog said. Nozibele made the bed.
Every day she had to cook and sweep and wash for the dog. Then one day the dog said,  "Nozibele,  today I have to visit some friends. Sweep the house,  cook the food and wash my things before I come back."
As soon as the dog had gone,  Nozibele took three hairs from her head. She put one hair under the bed,  one behind the door,  and one in the kraal. Then she ran home as fast as she could.
When the dog came back,  he looked for Nozibele. "Nozibele,  where are you?" he shouted. "I'm here,  under the bed," said the first hair. "I'm here,  behind the door," said the second hair. "I'm here,  in the kraal," said the third hair.
The dog knew that Nozibele had tricked him. He ran and ran all the way to the village. But Nozibele's brothers were waiting there with big sticks. The dog turned and ran away and has never been seen since.

There was a man called Lodipo. He lived with his two wives, Akai and Akitela.
Lodipo's first wife, Akai, was the only one who helped his blind mother.
One day, Lodipo's younger wife, Akitela, said, "Let us move away to a safer place." The place where they lived was constantly attacked by cattle raiders. Akitela felt unsafe.
Lodipo told Akitela that his blind mother did not want to move. Akitela insisted that they should move, and leave Lodipos' mother behind. "If we don't move away from here, I will return to my parents," Akitela cried to Lodipo.
Lodipo loved Akitela very much so he gave in to her demands. They prepared to leave. The first wife, Akai, watched all this happening with confusion.
Lodipo's blind mother sat on a goat skin under a tree. She was unaware of what was going on. "How can we leave her on her own?" Akai wondered to herself.
Lodipo and his wives loaded all their belongings on their two camels. They left quietly without even saying goodbye to the old woman. Akai was crying because she was sad to leave her mother-in-law all alone.
Immediately after Lodipo and his wives had left,  raiders attacked the place.
The raiders asked the old woman to tell them where her son went. "We are going after him to kill him," they told her. She pleaded, "Don't kill the first wife and her children." She also asked them to get back her ram, which Lodipo took with him.
The warriors followed Lodipo. Just as he was settling down in the new place, they caught up with him. They captured him and his young wife.
The first wife, Akai, went back to her mother-in-law with the ram. The two lived together happily.
One day, Anansi the spider picked up some yams in his garden. They were very beautiful and very good yams.He cooked them carefully on the fire. Then he sat down to eat them.
As Anansi was about to eat the first bite, he heard someone knock on the door. "Oh no !" Anansi thought. "Who could it be?" But he opened the door. It was Turtle who looked very tired. "Anansi, please let me in. I've walked so far today and I'm so tired and hungry," Turtle said. So what could Anansi do except let him in?
Anansi was too selfish to share his beautiful and good yams with anyone. So he came up with a nasty plan.As Turtle sat down at the table and started reaching out to grab some yams, Anansi shouted at him, "Turtle, your hands are all dirty! You can't eat with your hands all dirty! Go wash them."Turtle's hands were really dirty. So he crawled gently towards the river, washed his hands and then crawled back to the table.
But meanwhile, Anansi had started swallowing the yams. When Turtle returned, he saw that the yams were gone.Turtle looked at Anansi. "Thank you for inviting me to dinner. If you ever come near my house, come see me and let me make this dinner for you," he told him. And Turtle started crawling slowly towards his house.
After some time, Anansi began to think more and more about the free dinner promised by Turtle. So one day he went to visit.Anansi arrived at Turtle's house at dinner time as the sun was setting over the river. Turtle was lying on a rock in the sun, warming himself like turtles do.When Turtle saw Anansi, he said, "Hello, Anansi, did you come to eat with me?"And Anansi replied, "Yes, that would be very nice, thank you." He was getting hungrier and hungrier.
So Turtle dived to the bottom of the river to set the table for dinner and get everything ready. Anansi waited on the rocks on the bank.Soon Turtle came swimming back and said, "Oh Anansi, it's ready now, come have dinner with me."And Turtle dived again and started eating the green leaves prepared for dinner.
Anansi tried to dive to the bottom of the river, but it was a spider, not a turtle, and he couldn't dive that deep. He always came to the surface.He tried to jump into the river, he tried to dive, but nothing helped. He couldn't come down to eat that dinner.
Finally, Anansi had an idea. He put many stones in his coat pockets and was heavy enough to sink to the bottom of the river. How clever he was!He saw Turtle's table, full of juicy green leaves and lots of other delicious foods. Anansi's mouth was watering.
But just as Anansi grabbed some of that delicious food, Turtle stopped him. "Anansi, aren't you going to dinner with your coat on? We don't do that at home."Anansi, without thinking, replied, "Oh, of course you're right, Turtle, what was I thinking?" He took off his coat.
But without the stones in his pockets to hold him down, Anansi immediately rose to the surface of the river and found himself out of the water. Anansi sadly put her head in the water and watched Turtle eat all the delicious food!

There was a village near a lake.There lived a young girl. Her name was Atieno.
Atieno's father was a famous fisherman. He had his own little fishing canoe. Atieno enjoyed going fishing with her father.
Atieno loved to watch the boys play football. "Let me play with you," she begged them one day. The boys laughed at her, "Go and play hide and seek with girls. "
Girls said to Atieno, "Your legs are too long." Atieno was sad. Each morning, Atieno danced alone with the sun.The sun became her friend.
One day, the sun did not rise. Cocks did not crow. Birds did not sing. Children did not go to school. Even her father did not go fishing.Atieno was sad. "Where is my friend, the sun? Why is it so dark today?"
Atieno told the other children how sad she was. But they laughed at her, "Perhaps your friend the sun, is dead. Or perhaps it ran away from you."Atieno said, "The sun is my friend. It cannot die."
Atieno was so sad that she ran to the house. She kicked her brother's ball very hard.
Atieno thought, "I will play with this ball until my friend, the sun returns." She picked up the ball and ran out with it.
Atieno put the ball on the ground. She thought, "I can play just like those boys." She kicked the ball hard. It went up and up into the cloudy sky.
Everybody stared up. The ball disappeared into the thick clouds. There was total silence.
Suddenly, the thick clouds cleared. The sun appeared. Life returned to the village once again. Everybody prepared to do what they always did.
Atieno could not believe that the sun was back in the village. But most of all, the sun was back in her life. She told the children, "My friend, the sun is back!"
Once there was a young man called Kumbana.
When he was 25,  he fell in love with a girl called Zangane.
They were together for 3 years,  but he didn't have enough money to marry her.
Then one day she found she was pregnant,  because they didn't use protection.
A little girl was born,  and they called her Kheri.
But Kumbana was still studying,  and Zangane had a job in a town far away,  so they had to live apart.
After a while,  Zangane found a new boyfriend. He came to live with her and the little girl.
Kumbana was heart-broken. He cried and cried because he was separated from his daughter.
Time went on,  and Kumbana found a new girlfriend too. They lived together,  but they did not have any children.
Now Kheri did not like her new father at all. She was very unhappy,  and he used to beat her.
So when she was 12,  her mother decided to send her back to live with her real father.
Then Kumbana and Kheri were both happy again.
Once upon a time, there lived a man who had plenty of everything – a large fertile farm, with cattle, sheep, and goats. But, as he grew old, he grew sad, because one thing was missing. He did not have a wife.
Standing under a tree one day, he had a brilliant idea.If he couldn't find a wife, perhaps he could make one?
So he set to work to shape a beautiful woman from a strong branch of the tree. When he had finished making the statue, he touched her eyes, and they opened. He blew gently on her, and she came alive.
She was truly the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He knelt before her, and asked her to be his wife.
He gave her a colourful apron, beads, and a head ring, the sign of a married woman. And he built her a house with the mud and grass that used to lie at the foot of her trunk. "Only one thing I beg of you," he said to his wife. "Never tell anyone where you come from."
But before long, the young men from a neighbouring village began talking among themselves. "How can such an old man have such a beautiful young wife?" So they decided to steal her and take her to their own kraal.
The old man was heartbroken. He felt he could not live without her. But then he thought, "Perhaps if I have something of hers, I would not feel so sad?" So he sent his doves to find her, to sing to her, and to bring back something of hers to him.
When they found her, they sang to her in the language of birds. "Tree woman, tree woman. More beautiful than any other. Your husband has sent us. To bring back your apron!"
She gave them her apron, and they flew over the hill, over the river, back to her husband. He held the apron to his face, and was comforted for a little while.
But his longing did not go away. So again he sent his doves to sing to her:Tree woman, tree woman! More beautiful than any otherYour husband has sent us To bring back your head ring! And back they flew with the head ring, the sign of a married woman.
He held the head ring and sighed for his wife, far away in the kraal of other people. He called his doves again. He told them to go to her and sing: Tree woman, tree woman More beautiful than any other Your husband has sent us To bring back your life!
So away they went the third time. They perched on her shoulders. As they sang, each bird pecked out an eye. Immediately she turned again into a statue. Her feet and arms fell away. Then her head. And she fell to the ground.
Her husband slowly rolled her wooden trunk to the river. He stood her up with her roots in the water. Nourished by sun and soil, she grew leaves again.
And when the wind blows, the leaves sigh. Just as a woman does when she longs for her husband.
Once upon a time,  the animals decided to have a party. But it was not for all of them. It was only for the animals that had horns.
The rabbit was getting ready for the party. But then he found out that the party was not for everyone. It was just for animals with horns.
The rabbit went somewhere and got some horns. Then he put them on his head and went to the party.
During the party the rabbit ate and drank and danced.
This made him tired and he fell down in the sun. But while the rabbit was sleeping,  the horns fell off!
Then all the animals discovered that the rabbit was not the kind of animal they wanted. So they pulled his ears till they got bigger and bigger.
Then they ran away. And that's the reason why rabbits have big ears!

This is cow. Cow is cool!
By day,  it is an ordinary cow.
Flying a kite.
Kicking a ball.
By night,  a supercow!
Saving lives.
And fighting crime.
But if you close your eyes really tight,  and make a wish.
Cow might come to visit you too!
The end.
Long time ago, in the village of Elunyiko, there lived a man called Ndonga and his wife called Namukhaywa. They had six children. All of them were girls.
When Namukhaywa was pregnant with her seventh child, Ndonga warned her, "If you give birth to another girl, I will leave you. But if you give me a baby boy, I will hold a big party for you!"
When it was time to give birth, Namukhaywa went to the traditional midwife. Would the child be a girl or a boy?
It was a boy AND a girl – twins! She called the boy Mukhwana, and the girl she called Mulongo. As she looked at Mukhwana, she was very happy. But as she looked at Mulongo, she felt sad. She felt that there was only one thing she could do.
Namukhaywa left Mulongo in the care of the midwife and took Mukhwana home to her husband.
She proudly showed Ndonga the baby boy. He was very happy and called all the villagers to celebrate the birth of his son.
Mukhwana grew up to be a fine young man. And Mulongo grew up to be a fine young woman.
One day, while minding his father's cattle, Mukhwana saw a very beautiful girl. "This is the girl I want to marry," he said to himself.
But when he asked her to marry him, she sang this song: Mukhwana wefwe, Mukhwana. So yakhupa omunwa, Mukhwana. Nebebula omukhana, Mukhwana. Barulaka khulwanda, Mukhwana. Nebebula omusiani, Mukhwana. Barera mungo muno, Mukhwana. Iyeyi yakwa, Mukhwana. Iyindi yakwa, Mukhwana.
This happened again and again. Mukhwana did not know what to do. He went to his mother, Namukhaywa. "I have found a beautiful girl," he said. "And I want to marry her. But every time I ask her, she sings the same song."
To his surprise, Namukhaywa said, "What the girl is singing about is true. That is your sister. You were born twins. Your father wanted a son, not a daughter. So I left your baby sister with the midwife, and brought you home to your father."
When Mukhwana told his father the story, he saw that he had been wrong. He called Namukhaywa and together they went to the midwife to fetch Mulongo.
When Mulongo arrived home, her father and the village elders slaughtered a goat and performed the traditional ceremony for re-uniting Mulongo and her seven siblings.
A year later, Mulongo was married to the son of the rich king of that village. She brought a lot of wealth and happiness to her family.
Kate has a thing in her head. How will they remove it?
It makes her tired. It pains her. It makes her feel heavy.
She can't eat. She can't drink. She is not as jolly as before.
The doctor sees a swelling in her head and says, "There is a tumour in your brain."
"We have to remove it from your brain right now. We have to remove it now!" the doctor says.
They bring a stretcher.
They arrange the surgical blades.
They inject her with syringes.
They cut open Kate's head.
They remove the brain.
They cut out the tumour.
They return the brain to the skull. Then they stitch the head back together again.
Does Kate feel everything they do? No! Kate is in heaven. She does not feel. She does not eat. She does not think. For 24 hours!
Then she comes back to life!
Now she is well. Like a new born baby.
We are all happy for our friend Kate, who tasted heaven.
In a village on the slopes of Mount Kenya in East Africa,  a little girl worked in the fields with her mother. Her name was Wangari.
Wangari loved being outside. In her family's food garden she broke up the soil with her machete. She pressed tiny seeds into the warm earth.
Her favourite time of day was just after sunset. When it got too dark to see the plants,  Wangari knew it was time to go home. She would follow the narrow paths through the fields,  crossing rivers as she went.
Wangari was a clever child and couldn't wait to go to school. But her mother and father wanted her to stay and help them at home. When she was seven years old,  her big brother persuaded her parents to let her go to school.
She liked to learn! Wangari learnt more and more with every book she read. She did so well at school that she was invited to study in the United States of America. Wangari was excited! She wanted to know more about the world.
At the American university Wangari learnt many new things. She studied plants and how they grow. And she remembered how she grew: playing games with her brothers in the shade of the trees in the beautiful Kenyan forests.
The more she learnt,  the more she realised that she loved the people of Kenya. She wanted them to be happy and free. The more she learnt,  the more she remembered her African home.
When she had finished her studies,  she returned to Kenya. But her country had changed. Huge farms stretched across the land. Women had no wood to make cooking fires. The people were poor and the children were hungry.
Wangari knew what to do. She taught the women how to plant trees from seeds. The women sold the trees and used the money to look after their families. The women were very happy. Wangari had helped them to feel powerful and strong.
As time passed,  the new trees grew into forests,  and the rivers started flowing again. Wangari's message spread across Africa. Today,  millions of trees have grown from Wangari's seeds.
Wangari had worked hard. People all over the world took notice,  and gave her a famous prize. It is called the Nobel Peace Prize,  and she was the first African woman ever to receive it.
Wangari died in 2011,  but we can think of her every time we see a beautiful tree.
Tom carries a tray of ripe bananas.
Tom goes to the market to sell bananas.
People at the market are buying fruit.
But no one is buying Tom's bananas. They prefer to buy fruit from women.
"In our community,  only women sell fruit," people say. "What kind of a man is this?" people ask.
But Tom does not give up. He calls,  "Buy my bananas! Buy my sweet ripe bananas!"
One woman picks up a bunch of bananas from the tray. She looks at the bananas carefully.
The woman buys the bananas.
More people come to the stall. They buy Tom's bananas and eat them.
Soon,  the tray is empty. Tom counts the money he earned.
Then Tom buys soap,  sugar,  and bread. He puts the things in his tray.
Tom balances the tray on his head and goes home.
Mother and father left their baby with their older children.
The older children played and forgot about the baby.
One day, cranes came across the crying baby.
They lifted the baby in its blanket and flew away.
The mother saw four cranes flying away with her baby.
The cranes looked after the baby.
While the cranes were away, a frog swallowed the baby!
For three flies, the frog returned the baby to its parents.
Flying across the morning sky,Are birds in a hungry mood.Spot the one who has caught,A yummy worm for its food!
Butterflies of different colours,Are flitting flower to flower.But there’s one that stands out,Because it’s one colour all over.
A cheerful bunch of kites,Is merrily hopping about.But one’s not quite the same,Can you find the odd one out?
Big and small squares,Are shapes you see everywhere.There’s one grill that’s different,Where is it hidden, here or there?
Look among the green leaves,Of this big, old tree.There’s a branch with a speck of colour,Wherever can it be?
Planes flying across the sky,Leave behind a straight trail.But one of them is rather odd,And instead makes a curvy tail.
A line of chattering birds,Are sitting above, can you see?But one likes to be quiet,Whichever could it be?
A flock of white clouds,Gleams on a bright summer day.But one decides to be rainy,And doesn’t care what the others say.
A long day is done,And the night has just begun.Of all the streetlights,Find one that shines like the sun.
Bats sleep when the sun is out,And wake when it's night.Can you find the odd one,Who is still sleeping tight?
Outer space has many planets,Shiny and brightly lit.Spot one that’s unique,Because it has a ring around it.

Once upon a time there was a husband and wife with children. The mother prepared food for the family each day. She would bring the meal to the table for them to eat.
The father would divide the meat. He would say to the eldest child, "I am old enough for meat. Here is yours. Wait until you are older."
Then he would say to the next child, "I am old enough for meat. Here is yours. Wait until you are older." Each small portion became even smaller.  It went like this for all the children. The youngest child got a tiny piece of meat.
The father kept the big pieces of meat for himself and his wife. The children were quiet and ate their food.
Years passed and the children grew up. The parents grew old. They became weak. The children looked after their old mother and father.
One day at meal time, the eldest child served the meat,  as usual. But this time she gave only a tiny piece to her father and a tiny piece to her mother.
She said to her parents, "You ate yours, now it is our time. We are old enough."  She served most of the meat to her brothers and sisters.
The father remembered what he did while his children were young. Mother and father agreed that it was not the right thing to do. They asked for forgiveness. The children promised that they would not repeat this mistake with their own children.
The day that we’re waiting for is coming. It’s going to be Chiefs versus Aces on this very field. Come and watch! Come with your vuvuzela!
“Chiefs, the cup must come to sleep at home,” said Coach. “I want us to work together as a team to defeat the Aces. We must attack cleverly, defend well, and pass to each other.”
Soon we were practising hard. “Pass the ball, pass it, Portia Modise!”“Defend, defend, Jomo!”“There it is, there it is, into the goals!”Po-o-o-o! Po-o-o-o! Po-o-o-o! sounded the vuvuzela.
“You played wonderfully, my beautiful Chiefs!You attacked cleverly, you defended well, and you passed to each other. You played as a real team!”
“High five to all of you! Well done!” said Coach.
We went home really tired, but the practice was good.“When is the real match, Coach?” we asked.
Finally the day came. “Halala Chiefs, halala! It’s going to be a good game. The cup is ours!” said Coach. Po-o-o-o-o! Po-o-o-o! Po-o-o-o-o! sounded the vuvuzela.
And then there was a surprise. “What beautiful kit!  Thank you, Coach. We play the best, and now we also look the best!”

“I can’t lift you up, Shanu!” says Ammi. “You are too big!”
“You can’t walk to school alone, Shanu!” says Abbu. “You are too small!”
“You can’t sleep in the baby’s cot, Shanu!” says Dadu. “You are too big!”
“You can’t carry the baby to the park, Shanu!” says Dadi. “You are too small!”
Shanu is puzzled. Too big! Too small! How can she be too big andtoo small all at once?
Too big to wear her old pink frock.Too small to make dosas at the stove.
Too big to climb up on Dadu’s back?Too smallto carry the baby on hers?
“What am I the right size for?” Shanu wonders.
“You are just big enough to take me for my morning walks,” says Dadu.
“And you are just small enough for me to tell stories to,” says Dadi.
“And you will always, always be the perfect size...for this!" all say, and give her a warm, wonderful hug.

Anil became very angry. He was angry on his mother too.
" Let's go to the market and let's buy you something," said the mother.

Long time ago,  there were two young men who lost their cows. They looked for the cows until it was late.
As it got dark,  they saw a light in a house. They agreed to go and ask for a place to sleep.
They went to the house and knocked. The door opened and they went in. The young men didn't see anyone. But they heard a voice greeting them.
The voice said,  "I am a louse. Open the metal pot and have food. Open the earthenware pot and drink amahewu."
Then the louse put on its skin and went out.
The young men ate,  drank,  and gave thanks. Then they left the house.
As they left,  they had a bad thought. They said,  "No,  it couldn't have happened that we had food from a louse."  Eventually they agreed to go back and crush the louse.
They went back to the house and crushed the louse. Suddenly the louse was gone,  and the house disappeared! They found themselves outside in the open.
As I was moving in Buŋaanga village I found a fat hornbill.
When I struck it with a catapult, it shouted "ŋaa, ŋaa, ŋa!"
The hornbill flew into the air. But I ran after it through the grass.
Until it perched on a dead tree. Then I shot it again. This time it fell to the ground.
I picked up the hornbill.
And I gave it to Hiryagaana: one who eats whatever he finds. He happily received the hornbill.
The head of the hornbill was very big and as hard as a machete.
The bird had fat like that of a sheep. It was so appetising!
It's not easy to find a hornbill without planning. At night, hornbills roost on dry branches. A person eats what he likes. That is why Hiryagaana eats hornbills.
I had never worn shoes before. When I saw children wearing nice shoes, I would look at them with longing.
My mother would say, "You will have many pairs in the future, just wait!" Sometimes I did not believe her. "When is the future?" I asked her one day.
Time passed and it was nearly Christmas. Everybody was busy going to the market and coming back with bags of new things. "Mother, are we going to the market?" I asked her.
The day before Christmas, my mother woke me up earlier than usual. She asked me to fetch the big shopping basket she always carried to the market.
At the open-air market there, were many parents with their children. They were buying new clothes and stocking up on food.
We went straight to where there were many different types of shoes. My eyes were wide with amazement. I gaped at row after row of neatly arranged shoes.
After trying on many pairs, I settled for black lace-up shoes. At home that night, I couldn't sleep. I was so excited thinking of how I would wear my new shoes and show off to every child in the village.
After a while, I got out of bed and put on the shoes. I walked slowly around the room and then put the shoes back into the box. I lay down again, but I couldn't sleep.
I got up and tried on the shoes a second time. I strutted around the room for a while and then put them back.
I lay down once more and tried to sleep. But I got up a third time. I put on the shoes and jumped around the room. Then I felt tired. I decided to get back into bed.
The following morning, I was woken by my mother. "What is this I see?" she asked.
I was wearing my new shoes in bed!
Almost everyone calls me Daisy   The people that knew me in the early    stages of life call me Kisaakye Daisy
Thew few that claim to know me call me     Daisy KIsaakye Nabbumba
It takes more than a name to know a person.  That is why some people choose nicknames for their friends.
But to me, all that matters is calling me by my name    or my nickname and I respond with a smile.
Almost everyone knows that I am a girl.  Some think that I am a humble girl.  Few think that I am a proud girl.
﻿   My friends know that I am an out going and understanding, caring girl.
But to me, all that matters is being the best  girl i can be to everyone, those that i know and those that i don't know.

Hamps in the                                        west,
We need hamps on the highway

With humps in the road,                          Drivers reduce speed

Long time ago, there were two young men who lost their cows. They looked for the cows until it was late.
As it got dark, they saw a light in a house. They agreed to go and ask for a place to sleep.
They went to the house and knocked. The door opened and they went in. The young men didn't see anyone. But they heard a voice greeting them.
The voice said, "I am a louse*. Open the metal pot and have food. Open the earthenware pot and drink amahewu**."* A small parasitic insect** A Southern African drink
Then the louse put on its skin and went out.
The young men ate, drank, and gave thanks. Then they left the house.
As they left, they had a bad thought. They said, "No, it couldn't have happened that we had food from a louse." Eventually they agreed to go back and crush the louse.
They went back to the house and crushed the louse. Suddenly the louse was gone, and the house disappeared! They found themselves outside in the open.
There was a dark jungle.
It was a big dark jungle. There were lots of trees and a narrow path. Many animals and birds lived here.
One day,  all the animals came together. "Did you hear?" asked Tota,  the parrot. "Yes," said Hirni,  the deer. "What?" asked Darpok,  the rabbit. "We have a school in the jungle," answered Zhoola,  the monkey. Mota,  the elephant wondered,  "Hmph?" Lamboo,  the giraffe said,  "Oh,  good!" Dheema,  the snail squealed,  "Hurry,  let's go!"
Tota,  the parrot flew ahead. Zhoola,  the monkey jumped from tree to tree. Poorakha,  the python slithered fast. "Here!" shouted Tota. "Can you read?" "It is upside down,  I think," said Zhoola hanging by the branch. Poorakha concluded,  "Hisssss. No one can read."
Soon,  all the other friends joined them. Lamboo looked over the tree. "No one here," he said. Zhoola repeated,  "No one here." Tota proposed,  "Look carefully!" Pilloo,  the little bear declared,  "I found a room!"
"I found a swing",  announced Dheema. "What are these blocks?" Darpok wanted to know. "What is this?" was Zhoola's question. Poorakha explained,  "I believe,  this is a pencil."
Moto and Lamboo found a classroom. They called the others,  "Look,  what is this?" Everyone came with school bags. They began shouting,  "Teacher! Teacher! Where is our teacher?" No one knew.
Then they heard a roar. They heard a loud roar. They heard a louder roar. Poorakha was worried. Dheema was scared. Tota hid behind the board. Lamboo and Zhoola were puzzled.
Who is this? "Hup!" said Zhoola the monkey. No one spoke. They all looked at the teacher. Up and down carefully. Then they looked at one another.
The teacher turned to write on the black board. "Jump," said Zhoola. "Fly! Said Tota. Thump,  thump,  thump ran Mota. "Run,  run run fast," screamed Dheema. "Bhagoooo," they all shouted together. When the teacher turned. There was no one in the class."
There was a spider called Anansi. Anansi was too lazy to cook his own food. Instead, he used to visit his friends and eat the delicious food they had cooked.
One day, Anansi was passing Rabbit's house when he smelled green vegetables cooking. He was very excited. Rabbit said to Anansi, “They're not quite ready yet. You can help me to wash up while we wait.” Anansi replied, “Sorry, I have things to do. I'll come back later.”
“How will I call you when they're ready?” asked Rabbit. Anansi thought for a minute. “I'll spin a web,” he said. “I'll tie one end around my leg and one end to your pot. When the greens are ready, pull on the web string. I'll come right away.” So Anansi tied the web to the pot, and walked on.
Anansi saw Monkey and his wife, cooking beans in a large pot. “Come and join us! The beans are nearly ready.” Monkey said. Anansi replied, “Sorry, I have things to do. Let me tie one end of this web around my leg and one end to your pot. When the beans are ready, pull on the web string, and I'll come.”
As Anansi walked by Warthog's house, he smelled sweet potatoes. Warthog told Anansi, “My pot is full of sweet potatoes and honey! Come and share my food with me. Take this fork and help me to stir it.” Anansi replied, “I'll come back later. Let me tie one end of this web around my leg and one end to your pot. When the sweet potatoes areready, pull on the web string, and I'll come.”
By the time Anansi arrived at the river, each of his eight legs was tied to a pot of delicious food. Then, Anansi felt a pull on one of his legs. “Rabbit's food is ready!” Anansi thought, licking his lips.
He felt a second pull. And a third. And a fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth pull. Everyone was pulling on the web strings at the same time! “Stop! Stop!” he cried in pain, as his legs were stretched thinner and thinner. But no one could hear him.
Finally, the web strings could hold no longer. They snapped, one by one. Anansi rolled into the river to soothe his painful legs. But his legs would not return to their normal shape. Anansi was too embarrassed to go to any of his friends that day.

Once up on a time, there were two friends. The one was clever, the other was stupid. The stupid man's wife was clever. The clever man's wife was stupid.
While they were chatting, the clever man said, "Your wife is clever, but you are stupid. My wife is also stupid, so she might be more compatible with you."
The stupid man asked, "Between me and you, who is stupider?" Then he said, "I am as clever as you are." "If so, let's go to a judge and I will ask you a question," replied the clever man. They agreed to go.
In front of the judge, the clever man asked, "How many stars are there in the sky? Where is the centre of the world? Answer both questions, or we will swap our wives." The judge allowed some time for the stupid man to return with the answers.
One night, the stupid man was counting the stars, sitting on the roof of his house. "What are you doing?" his wife asked him.
He replied, "My friend asked me how many stars there are in the sky, and where the centre of the earth is. Now I'm counting the stars."
"Don't worry, I will tell you the answers," said his wife. She gave her husband a sack of grain. She said, "If they ask you how many stars are in the sky, tell them it is the same as the number of grains in the sack."
Then she gave him a stick and said, "If they ask you where the centre of the world is, push the stick into the ground and tell them it is in the centre. If they complain, tell them to measure it."
The stupid man arrived with his wife's advice. First he answered, "The number of stars is the same as the number of grains in this sack." Then he pushed the stick into the ground and said, "This is the centre of the earth."
The judge was amused and asked, "Who told you this?" The stupid man replied, "My wife."    The judge continued, "Your wife is very clever, so she should be with a clever man. You will swap your wives."  Then, the judge set an appointment to swap their wives.
The stupid man told his wife, "I won, but the judge said that you are clever, and don't deserve to be with me." His wife replied, "Don't worry I have a solution to this too."
The time came for the judge to swap the wives. The clever wife gave the judge a saucepan of food as a gift. When the judge opened the saucepan, he saw a roasted chicken still with all its feathers! Shocked, he muttered, "Oh, I see, so she belongs with her stupid husband afterall!"

Once upon a time, there was an old woman who lived with her three grandchildren.
Every morning they all went to work in the field. One day, one of the girls said, "Grandmother, I don't feel well today."
So, the old woman sent the child home.
When the girl got home, she saw that there was meat in the pot. She ate all the meat and then went to sleep.
The old woman and two children were tired and hungry when they returned from the field. Grandmother prepared ugali for supper, to eat with the meat she had cooked that morning.
She opened the pots to serve her grandchildren. When she opened the pot with the meat, it was empty!
"Who ate the meat?" asked Grandmother, frowning. But all three grandchildren shook their heads. "Not me," each one said.
Their grandmother tied a rope across the river. She told each of them to walk on the rope as they sang a song.
"The one that ate the meat will fall into the river, and learn to tell the truth," warned Grandmother.The first granddaughter walked quickly across the river, singing the song.
The other two grandchildren began to argue with each other. The girl said to the boy, "You go next." The boy replied, "No, you go next!"
The granddaughter who ate the meat was scared and shivering. As she stepped forward to walk on the rope, she slipped and fell into the river.
"Help! Help!" shouted the girl. Grandmother said to the other two, "She is guilty, but we must help her."
Together they pulled the frightened girl out of the river. Since that day, the old woman's grandchildren have always told the truth.

Long,  long time ago,  animals used to speak.  There lived Hare and Hyena.
The two were very closed friends.  They did everything together including looking for food.
Hare was very clever. She gathered more food than the lazy Hyena.
Hyena was lazy but he liked eating very much. Although they hunted differently,  they put the food together.
Hare used her tricks to get food faster.   She also ate some before taking it to where Hyena was.
During the drought,  it was very hard for the two to gather enough food for themselves.
One day,  Hare woke Hyena up very early in the morning. They stood under a tree to discuss how they were going to live.
There was only one bus in Ebei's village. It was big and blue. It was very noisy.
“Tomorrow we will go to town,” said Ebei's mother. “We will buy your school uniform.”
Ebei was very excited. They would travel in the big blue bus. He could not sleep that night.
When his mother came to wake him, Ebei was already dressed.
Ebei and his mother walked to the bus stop. They waited for the big blue bus. But the bus did not come.
Other people arrived at the bus stop. They complained because the bus was late. “Where is the bus?” they asked.
Ebei was worried. “We will not be able to go to town,” he thought. “I will not be able to get my uniform.”
Some people gave up and went home. Ebei cried. He did not want to go. “We will wait a bit longer,” said his mother.
Suddenly, they heard a noise. They saw dust in the air. The bus was coming!
But this bus was not blue. It was not big. It was red and small. The people did not want to get in this bus.
“Get in! Get in!” shouted the driver. “We are very late today,” he called.
Ebei and his mother got in first. Soon everyone else got in the small red bus.
Ebei looked out the window. He saw more people at the bus stop.
Even more people were running to catch the bus. But they were too late. The red bus was full. It left for town.
“Where is the big blue bus?” asked Ebei's mother. “It broke down,” replied the driver. “We are fixing it. It will come tomorrow.”
Ebei did not care about the colour of the bus. He did not care about the size. This bus was going to town!

“Grandmother does not know anything. I will take the golden teeth,” saidAjoh. Apiyo and Atieno were not happy.
Lego came looking for his golden teeth. They were not there. Lego thought, “The one who took my teeth will know who I am!”
On their way home, the girls heard, “Hzzzzzzzz!” Lego was there with his mouth wide open, ready to swallow.
Lego asked, “Who took my golden teeth?” No one answered. Lego said, “The innocent girl will sing well. The thief will not.”
Apiyo sang: It's not me! It's not me who took the teeth! The one who took is near!Atieno also sang well.
Ajoh sang badly and the words did not come out. Lego shouted, “Sing like the others.” Lego knew that Ajoh took his golden teeth.

He then, called all villagers and he chose ten young boys to whom he delivered seeds, asked them to go and plant them and after two weeks the one who will bring the best result will be his adopted son and the heir of his throne.
In one family, one child planted his seed, watered them everyday, did all his best but the grains refused to grow up.
His friends advised him to go to the market and buy corn that he will present to the king so that he can be chosen." I can't do that, my parents taught me to be honest ", said the young boy to his friends.
Time and days passed and the ten boys went to the kingdom palace to show their results.All of them came with some sacks of corn except one child.- What did you do with the seeds? said the king to the empty handed boy.- Majesty, I planted and watered them but they didn't grow up, said the young boy.
The king took the young boy and said: the biggest quality that must have a king is honesty. All your grains were boiled that means they can't grow.Only this boy succeeded and he become my son

Hen ran for dear life and went to stay with the humans. Till today hens live with humans and eagles feed on the chickens.
There is something in this world that is better than any thing else in the world.
It is better than food.   It is better than sleep.  It is better than the happy sound of children.
It is better than drinking water.  It is better than the smell of wet soil.  It is better than all existing things.
When you get a job.  Nothing can stop you from working.  Nothing else makes sense to you.
But you only consider the job.  Even if you are told the worst things   about the job you have.
You can never listen to them because all your heart   and mind knows is that the job has to help you achieve  all your dreams in life.
A heart to hate you,
Is as far as the sun
A heart to love you
Is as near as the door.
A heart for me,
And a heart for you.
And a heart for you.
A heart for us all and my puppy
heart heart heart
A heart for mummy
a heart for daddy
Happiness from within the heart

Do you see why the palm tree is important?

And can't do whatI can't.
I've looked andlooked everywhere to find another me. I went down to the park and looked behindthe trees.
I looked around,up and down.
At every singleface.
I couldn't find anotherme in any single place.
There's only oneme in the world! I'm special, oh it's true!
But not just me,don't you see? There's only one of you!
'Wov! What a lovely raincoat!' Mannu danced happily holding the shining red raincoat that his parents had bought for him.'Mamma, may I wear the raincoat now?' Manu asked his mother.Mamma said, 'No, my child. You can wear it when it rains. It should start raining soon. But as of now I don't see any signs of the rain.'
But, Monday was a bright sunny day, full of golden sunshine.Mannu looked out of the window every now and then and asked his mother,'Mamma, will it rain today?'Mamma  peeped out of the window and said, ' I don't think it will rain today. You cannot wear the raincoat today. People will laugh at you, if you do.'
On Tuesday also Mannu kept looking at the sky. And the raincoat was kept right next to him, ready to be used. But the sky was a nice blue and as bright as it was on Monday.Mannu was disappointed,'Mamma, when will I be able to use the raincoat?''There is just a single cloud in the sky today, and that too a white one. I don't think you will get a chance to wear the raincoat today.'Mamma said.
Wednesday again was a very hot sunny day.Mannu was getting worried, 'Mamma, why is it not raining yet?'He tried to put the raincoat on at home. But had to immediately take it off because he felt too hot in it.Mamma, in her eagerness to comfort him said, 'I think it will rain soon, probably by afternoon.'
On Thursday, there was the school picnic. Mannu was eager to show off the raincoat to his school buddies.'Mamma, shall I carry the raincoat to the picnic. What if it rains there?' Mannu asked.'Don't, my pet. It will not rain today. See those white clouds? And they are also so far away.' Mamma tried to comfort him.
And... at last  on Friday, the sky looked quite dark with black clouds. Mannu kept the raincoat ready at hand.'Mamma, it will rain today, right mamma?' Mannu asked excitedly. The peacock also seemed to think so and started dancing. The tortoise came out of it's hiding and looked up at the sky hoping perhaps to feel cooler after the hot summer.'I think so. Today the sky is full of black clouds.' Mamma smiled at Mannu's excitement and was happy for him.
On the Saturday morning there was a loud thunder.  And also lightening.'Mamma, it that not lightening? Now it will surely rain, right Mamma?' asked Manu.He ran out on the lawns and saw that a frog and a tortoise also had come out of their hiding.
And.. tip...tap...tip...tap... came down the raindrops!Mannu, loved the rains...raincoat or no raincoat.'Oh, it is raining; it is raining.' Thus shouting  Mannu ran out of the house and started  jumping and dancing in the rain. And he had the company of the frog who also seemed to be  waiting for the rains.
'Wait Mannu, wait.' Mamma ran after him with his raincoat in her hand. 'You forgot your raincoat!'But Mannu was very happy getting drenched in rains. The raincoat which he was holding close to himself all this time was all forgotten.

I am always scared because every night I wet the bed.
Whenever I dream,  I suddenly wake up wet.
I quickly change position and sleep in Anna's which is dry and warm.
In the morning,  I wake up first and leave Anna in bed.
And when mother asks who wet the bed,  I loudly say it is Anna.
So the next day mother decides to sleep with Anna in her bed.
Unfortunately,  the same thing happens and now there is no one to else to blame.
Finally mother finds out that Anna does not wet the bed but I do.
In the past,  rat and frog were friends.
They lived on the same village.
Rat was a farmer of maize,  Frog was not interested in that job. At rat's home food was always there.
His children never knew what famine is His children never got hungry.
At frogs home,  there was always famine This caused frog to always beg maize from Mr Rat.
It never pleased Mr Rat to feed frogs family Mr Rat got a good wisdom that the agriculture department passed a law.
Only maize grain should be eaten not flour. This became very hard for the frog.
From that time to now frog cannot eat maize grain.

Shanti and Arun were good friends. They had so much fun together.They shared secrets in class. They ran races on the way home.She was always cheerful.
One day, Shanti came into the classroom slowly. Her head was bent. She looked sad. “Did someone scold you?” asked Arun.Shanti shook her head. She sat down and did not look up. She did not answer ‘Present!’ when Sona Miss called her name. Sona Miss called again, louder this time, “Shanti Kumar!” Shanti raised her hand.
“Do you have a sore throat?” her teacher asked her. Shanti shook her head.Her cheeks were red and it looked like she had a fever.“Are you feeling okay?” Sona Miss asked.Shanti nodded, still not daring to look up.
“Why does Shanti look so sad?”“Is your little brother okay?”“Is your puppy okay?”“Is your grandmother okay?”Shanti kept nodding her head to each of her friends. But she did not look up.
Arun wanted to make her smile. He had an idea! He took out something from his bag.As he ran to show it to Shanti, it slipped out of his hands. Shanti saw something flying towards her and she grabbed it.
It was a BIG, green, rubber frog!Shanti's eyes flew open. Then she opened her mouth to laugh.THEN Arun and her friends saw why she had not smiled or talked all day!Four of her front teeth had gone missing!

Kate  has a thing in her head.        How will they remove it?
Itmakes her tired. It pains her.It makes her heavy.
Shecan’t eat. She can’t drink. She is not as jolly as before,
A  doctor is scanning her head.        Oh dear. It’s a pity.   Poorwoman! Her head throbs with pain.
The  doctor has seen a swelling in the head. The  doctor says, “this is a blood tumor.”        “We have to remove it from your  brain right now.”       “We have to remove it now!”  That is what the doctor says
They  bring a stretcher.
They  arrange the surgical blades.
They  inject her with syringes.
They  cut open Kate’s head.
They  remove the brain.
They  cut out the clot of blood.        Kate is like a child.
The  return the brain into the head.        They  stitch the head together
Does Kate feel everything they do?  No!  Kate is in heaven.        She does not feel. Or eat.  She does  not think.        For 24 hours
Then  she comes back to life!
Now she is well.        Now  she speaks straight.        Like a baby newly born.
We  are all happy.          For our friendKate who tasted heaven.
Long, long ago, the Sky God, Nyame, kept all stories locked in a wooden box, high in the sky. People down on earth had no stories to tell and they were very sad. They asked Anansi the clever Spider to help them.
Anansi spun a long thread, and climbed up his sticky thread all the way to heaven. “Can I have the stories, please?” he asked the Sky God. But Nyame laughed at Anansi and said, “Oh, these are very expensive stories. You wouldn't be able to pay for them, little spider.”
“How much do the stories cost?” asked Anansi. “You'll have to bring me three rare and fierce animals,” Nyame answered, “A leopard with sharp teeth like spears, a hornet that stings people, and a snake that swallows people whole.” He laughed and laughed. He thought his stories were quite safe.
So Anansi climbed slowly back down his sticky thread to the earth. He thought and he thought, and he came up with a plan. He dug a deep hole, covered it with branches and dirt so it was hidden, and he went home for supper. In the morning, sure enough, a leopard had fallen into his pit. He was furiously scratching at the side of the pit, but he couldn't get out.
“Oh let me help you, my dear friend!” said Anansi. “Just lie down on these sticks and I'll pull you out.” Anansi wound his sticky web round the leopard and the sticks, and pulled him up to heaven to show the Sky God. But Nyame just laughed and said, “Where are the other two?”
So Anansi went back down to earth to get the second creature. He thought and he thought and he came up with a plan. He took a gourd full of water and went to the tree where the hornets lived. He poured out some of the water all over their nest. Then he cut a leaf from a banana tree and held it over his head, and he poured the rest of the water all over himself.
He called out to the hornets, “Hey hornets! Come see! It is raining! Quick ­get inside my gourd and it will keep all of you dry.” Hornets don't like to get wet, so they all flew into Anansi's gourd.
Then Anansi quickly spun a web across the opening so the hornets couldn't get out no matter how much they buzzed. He carried them up to heaven and showed them to the Sky God. But Nyame just said, “Where's the last one?” (He wasn't laughing so much anymore.).
So Anansi went down to earth again. He thought and thought and he thought, but he couldn't come up with a plan. So he asked his wife, who had a very good idea. Together they found a good long thick branch and some strong vines. When they got near the stream where the snake lived, they began to argue. “The branch is longer!” “No, it isn't!” “Yes it is!”
Soon the snake came out and asked what the argument was. “I was arguing with my wife,” said Anansi. “She says this stick is longer than you are. But I don't agree.” “Of course I'm longer than that stick!” said the snake. “I'm very long! I'm a huge snake! Just put your stick next to me and measure!”
So Anansi did that, and he tied the snake to the stick with his vine to keep him straight. When he was all tied up, Anansi took the snake up to heaven.
Nyame had to admit that Anansi had paid his price. So he went to his wooden box, opened the lid, and gave all the stories to Anansi. Anansi carried the stories triumphantly down to earth. He shared them with his wife, and with all the other animals and people. Stories are for telling, not for keeping in wooden boxes.

One day there was a great famine in the land. No one had anything to eat except the crows. Each morning they flew a long distance to where there was a tree with ripe figs in the middle of a wide river. Then they flew back with the figs for themselves and their relatives. The sight of so many figs made Anansi's mouth water. How could he get them for himself?
He thought of a plan. He carefully covered his bottom with sticky beeswax. Then he took a piece of clay pot and went to see the crows. “Please could you help me?” he asked. “I need a live coal to get my fire going again.” As they were getting the coal from the fire, Anansi carefully sat firmly on one of the largest figs, so that it would stick to his bottom. He thanked the crows, and hurried home to enjoy the fig.
But one fig wasn't enough for him. He went back a second time, and did the same. When he went back a third time, the crows began to get suspicious. “Why do you keep coming back to us to get a coal?” they said. Anansi answered, “Every time when I get home, the coal has burnt out.” “You're lying!” said the crows. “You just want our food!” “That's not true,” said Anansi. And he started crying.
The crows felt sorry for him. The next morning at first light, each crow gave him a feather. He flew with them to the fig tree in the middle of the wide river. When he saw the luscious figs, Anansi wanted them all for himself. Each time a crow tried to pick a fig, he shouted out, “That one is mine! I saw it first!” And then he took the fig and put it into his bag. Eventually he had all the figs and the crows had none.
He was left all alone as the darkness began to fall. “If I don't want to stay in this tree for the rest of my life,” he said to himself, “I'll just have to jump into the air like the crows.” So he took a deep breath, jumped, and PLOP! He fell into the river right among the crocodiles.
“What do we have here?” said a gruff crocodile voice. “A tasty morsel to eat, nyum”. “Oh please don't” said Anansi. And he began to cry. “I'm one of you, don't you know? I got lost in the days of your grandfathers and no one was able to find me. You're the first of my relatives I've ever met!” He cried so much that the crocodiles felt sorry for him.
The oldest crocodile said, “We'll know you're one of us if you can eat and enjoy mud soup just like we do.” They gave him a pot of dirty brown water. “Just like my grandmother used to make it!” Anansi said. But he made a hole in the ground with his back foot, and a hole in the pot with his front foot. As he pretended to drink the soup, it oozed down through the pot into the hole beneath his feet.
“Delicious!” he exclaimed, giving back the empty pot. "Now we know you are definitely one of us," the crocodiles said. So they allowed Anansi to sleep in their hole with them for the night. "Tomorrow morning I'll tell you the story of my life," said Anansi as they fell asleep.
Early the next morning, before first light, Anansi woke up one of the crocodiles. "I want to go and fetch my wife and children from across the river, so that they can help me tell my story. Will you help me before the others wake up?" he asked the crocodile.
The crocodile was grumpy at being woken up so early. “Please help me! You swim much faster than I do,” Anansi said. The crocodile agreed, and Anansi rode on his back to the bank of the river. He climbed off quickly. “I'll be back soon! Don't go away!” Anansi said, as he disappeared through the grass.
As far as we know, the crocodile is waiting for him still, with just his long snout and his beady eyes above the surface of the river.

Today is my first day of school. Mother held my hand and walking with me. "Now I have grown up," I say. "Come...come!"Mother held my hand tightly.
There are many children near the school.Some come by bus. Some come by car.Some come by rickshaw. Some come by bicycle and some come on foot, like me.
We reached to the gate.Mother left my hand.She stopped on gate. I have to go alone inside.Many unknown faces are around me.
I moved one step. I moved another step.  I looked behind. As I move forward, mother looks smaller. Would she disappeared? I ran to her. I don't think I've grown up. I hold her hand and say, "don't go".
All had gone inside. Only I was outside. Teacher came outside.She smiles after looking me. I also smiles. Mother says," Rani I will meet you here when you come out". I leave her hand. She waive her hand.
I ran inside. Mother would meet there on leave.

The rich man doesn't know how to interact with the poor man.
When they walk with their feet, he drives his car with his hands.
When you complain to a rich man about how you have not eaten.
he will not understand why, simply because even his dogs have excess to eat.
The face of a rich man will always look young when they are old and  old when they are young.
The stomach of a rich man keeps swelling from too much satisfaction from what life has to offer
Money has made the rich man forget about humanity.
