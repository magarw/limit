a warm morning , Raja woke up with a yawn and said to himself "lets go for fishing now".
While going to the pond,he met Ram,his best friend and invited him to go to the pond together.
Sita saw them going for fishing. The boys asked her if she wanted to come with them.
Sita thought for a moment and said "don't do this,fishes will die when separated by water"
They didn't paid attention to her and continued on their way to the pond.
Raja and Ram sat near the pond and saw to fishes jumping in water,one was a thin and second a fat one.
There came a third fish. They didn't saw any fish bigger than this! Sita said" This fish is even bigger than my father's foot!"
Raja and Ram took their fishing rods with and struggled for the fish.Ram said"its mine!"Raja said"no,its mine!"
Raja pulled the rod, Ram pulled stronger.
BOOM! They fell down as their rods broke.
Do you know why ?Any guesses ?fished tied their strings together!

Nusha was a little girl who wasn't very good at anything.
But when she was 12, she found she could fly.
She flew to school when she was late.
She flew to her grandma's house on weekends.
She flew to the market because it was quicker.
She flew across the sea to church.
She flew along the beach and saw people kissing.
She flew up to get coconuts from trees.
People paid her to help fix their roofs.
All her friends asked her how she did it.
"You have to think very, very hard," she said, "and you have to really really want to do it."
One day she met a boy who could fly too.
They started to go out together.
Maybe they got married and had children in the end.

On a bright sunny day, a fawn was racing in a forest.
On his way he met a rabbit, he ran past the fast runner.
Next, he met an elephant and he ran past the huge animal too.
Then came a stream, he leapt and cleared the stream feeling refreshed with the fresh and cool water.
He was still full of energy, so he ran past the crumbling wall too.
He was sure that he is going to win the race and in his excitement he missed a large boulder on the grassy plain. He stumbled and fell down.
He got hurt in his leg and was bleeding. He burst into tears.
Hearing his cry a monkey came and massaged his aching leg and the tears flowed from the fawn's eyes.
Brother bear also came and picked him up but the fawn didn't stop crying
Mama dear came running to her baby and said, "Look we'll beat up this bad boulder!"
The fawn forgot his pain and stood up and said, "Oh, don't do that or he will also start crying." His mother laughed and hugged him. So did the fawn.

He loves food, but he is too lazy to cook.
"Yes. Help me with stirring," says Rabbit. But Anansi is lazy.
Anansi ties some web around his leg and to Rabbit's pot.
"Monkeys, can I share your beans?" "Yes. Help us with chopping."
"Warthog, can I share your potatoes?" "Yes. Help me with preparing."
Soon,  each of Anansi's 8 legs is tied to a pot.
All 8 legs are being pulled! "Stop pulling!" cries Anansi.
Anansi's legs stretched! And so all spiders have long thin legs.
A long time ago, three girls went out to collect wood.
It was a hot day so they went down to the river to swim. They played and splashed and swam in the water.
Suddenly, they realised that it was late. They hurried back to the village.
When they were nearly home, Nozibele put her hand to her neck. She had forgotten her necklace! "Please come back with me!" she begged her friends. But her friends said it was too late.
Nozibele went back to the river alone. She found her necklace and began hurrying home. But, she got lost in the dark.
In the distance she saw light coming from a hut. She walked quickly towards it and knocked at the door.
To her surprise, a dog opened the door and said, "What do you want?" "I'm lost and I need a place to sleep," said Nozibele. "Come in, or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele went in.
The dog said, "Cook for me!" "But I've never cooked for a dog before," Nozibele answered. "Cook, or I'll bite you!" said the dog. Nozibele cooked some food for the dog.
Then the dog said, "Make the bed for  me!" Nozibele answered, "I've never made a bed for a dog." "Make the bed, or I'll bite you!" the dog said. Nozibele made the bed.
Every day she had to cook and sweep and wash for the dog. Then one day the dog said, "Nozibele, today I have to visit some friends. Sweep the house, cook the food and wash my things before I come back."
As soon as the dog had gone, Nozibele took three hairs from her head. She put one hair under the bed, one behind the door, and one in the kraal. Then she ran home as fast as she could.
When the dog came back, he looked for Nozibele. "Nozibele, where are you?" he shouted. "I'm here, under the bed," said the first hair. "I'm here, behind the door," said the second hair. "I'm here, in the kraal," said the third hair.
The dog knew that Nozibele had tricked him. He ran and ran all the way to the village. But Nozibele's brothers were waiting there with big sticks. The dog turned and ran away and has never been seen since.

There was only one bus in Ebei's village. It was big and blue. It was very noisy.
“Tomorrow we will go to town,” said Ebei's mother. “We will buy your school uniform.”
Ebei was very excited. They would travel in the big blue bus. He could not sleep that night.
When his mother came to wake him, Ebei was already dressed.
Ebei and his mother walked to the bus stop. They waited for the big blue bus. But the bus did not come.
Other people arrived at the bus stop. They complained because the bus was late. “Where is the bus?” they asked.
Ebei was worried. “We will not be able to go to town,” he thought. “I will not be able to get my uniform.”
Some people gave up and went home. Ebei cried. He did not want to go. “We will wait a bit longer,” said his mother.
Suddenly, they heard a noise. They saw dust in the air. The bus was coming!
But this bus was not blue. It was not big. It was red and small. The people did not want to get in this bus.
“Get in! Get in!” shouted the driver. “We are very late today,” he called.
Ebei and his mother got in first. Soon everyone else got in the small red bus.
Ebei looked out the window. He saw more people at the bus stop.
Even more people were running to catch the bus. But they were too late. The red bus was full. It left for town.
“Where is the big blue bus?” asked Ebei's mother. “It broke down,” replied the driver. “We are fixing it. It will come tomorrow.”
Ebei did not care about the colour of the bus. He did not care about the size. This bus was going to town!

Malela village was surrounded by hills. Many snakes lived in the forest on those hills. The biggest snake was called python by the villagers. Python scared many people. It swallowed whole goats and sheep.
One day, three sisters, Mutale, Mutinta and Mabvuto went to the forest to fetch firewood. The girls' grandmother warned, "Beware of Python the big snake. Do not take anything from the forest except the wood."  Only Ajoh did not pay attention to her grandmother.
The girls packed milk, bananas, sweet potatoes and water. They took ropes for tying firewood and a sharp dagga for chopping the wood. Then they left for the forest.
On the way, the sisters chatted and laughed. Suddenly,  Mutale, the eldest of them, said, "Be quiet. We are coming to where Unyalego the snake lives."
Mabvuto called to the others, "Look, here are Python's golden teeth. Let us take them."  Mutale reminded them, "Don't forget grandmother's warning. We must not take anything from the forest except firewood."
Mutinta said, "I don't trust grandmother. She said that to stop us having what we want. I want the golden teeth." Her sisters were worried, but Mutinta did not care.
At that moment Python came looking for his golden teeth. He was furious when he could not find the teeth. Then python heard the girls chatting and laughing. He hid under a rock next to the road where the girls would pass on their way back.
The sisters were going home carrying their firewood. Suddenly, they heard, "Hssssss!" There was Python with his mouth wide open, ready to bite. The girls were terrified.
Python asked the girls, "Who took my golden teeth?" No one answered. Python decided to test the girls. "Whoever is innocent,  will be able to sing well. She will go home with her wood. But the guilty one will sing badly. And I will eat her!"
Mutale started to sing with a clear voice, "It was not me,  it was not me who took the teeth. The one who took is still behind." Then Mabvuto sang the song. She also sang well.
Lastly, it was Mutinta's turn. She was scared. She started singing. It  sounded terrible and the words were wrong. Python shouted, "Can't you sing properly like the others?" Python knew that Mutinta took his golden teeth.
Python opened his huge jaws and swallowed Mutinta. Her sisters ran back to the village. They told everyone the story of what happened. "I warned her, if only she had listened," the girls' grandmother said sadly.
'Wov! What a lovely raincoat!' Mannu danced happily holding the shining red raincoat that his parents had bought for him.'Mamma, may I wear the raincoat now?' Manu asked his mother.Mamma said, 'No, my child. You can wear it when it rains. It should start raining soon. But as of now I don't see any signs of the rain.'
But, Monday was a bright sunny day, full of golden sunshine.Mannu looked out of the window every now and then and asked his mother,'Mamma, will it rain today?'Mamma  peeped out of the window and said, ' I don't think it will rain today. You cannot wear the raincoat today. People will laugh at you, if you do.'
On Tuesday also Mannu kept looking at the sky. And the raincoat was kept right next to him, ready to be used. But the sky was a nice blue and as bright as it was on Monday.Mannu was disappointed,'Mamma, when will I be able to use the raincoat?''There is just a single cloud in the sky today, and that too a white one. I don't think you will get a chance to wear the raincoat today.'Mamma said.
Wednesday again was a very hot sunny day.Mannu was getting worried, 'Mamma, why is it not raining yet?'He tried to put the raincoat on at home. But had to immediately take it off because he felt too hot in it.Mamma, in her eagerness to comfort him said, 'I think it will rain soon, probably by afternoon.'
On Thursday, there was the school picnic. Mannu was eager to show off the raincoat to his school buddies.'Mamma, shall I carry the raincoat to the picnic. What if it rains there?' Mannu asked.'Don't, my pet. It will not rain today. See those white clouds? And they are also so far away.' Mamma tried to comfort him.
And... at last  on Friday, the sky looked quite dark with black clouds. Mannu kept the raincoat ready at hand.'Mamma, it will rain today, right mamma?' Mannu asked excitedly. The peacock also seemed to think so and started dancing. The tortoise came out of it's hiding and looked up at the sky hoping perhaps to feel cooler after the hot summer.'I think so. Today the sky is full of black clouds.' Mamma smiled at Mannu's excitement and was happy for him.
On the Saturday morning there was a loud thunder.  And also lightening.'Mamma, it that not lightening? Now it will surely rain, right Mamma?' asked Manu.He ran out on the lawns and saw that a frog and a tortoise also had come out of their hiding.
And.. tip...tap...tip...tap... came down the raindrops!Mannu, loved the rains...raincoat or no raincoat.'Oh, it is raining; it is raining.' Thus shouting  Mannu ran out of the house and started  jumping and dancing in the rain. And he had the company of the frog who also seemed to be  waiting for the rains.
'Wait Mannu, wait.' Mamma ran after him with his raincoat in her hand. 'You forgot your raincoat!'But Mannu was very happy getting drenched in rains. The raincoat which he was holding close to himself all this time was all forgotten.

Sheep lived in the city. She got tired of city life and decided to go to the bush.On her way she met Hyena who had not eaten for many days.
She greeted Hyena over and over again, "Brother Hyena, how are you? Brother Hyena, how are you?"Hyena answered Sheep, "Don't greet me over and over. Do something to end my hunger."
When Sheep heard this, she started running. Suddenly, she reached Lion's den. Hyena was running after her. Hyena arrived at the den and finally stopped, throwing dust into Lion's eyes.
Lion said to Hyena, "Can't we even find peace in our dens? You throw dust into our eyes!" Hyena answered, "King, I did not mean to disrespect you! I am only running after my food!"
Lion said, "You are food to me, too, Hyena. Did I chase you? You came to me. Don't blame me later."
Then Lion said to Sheep, "Why did you come to the bush?" Sheep replied, "I came because I am a diviner."
Lion said, "Prepare traditional medicine to prove that you are truly a diviner." Sheep replied, "My medicine is expensive." Lion said, "That is no problem, whatever it costs. There is nothing that is impossible for me."
Sheep said, "The medicine is Hyena's ear." Lion cut off Hyena's ear and gave it to Sheep. Sheep put Hyena's ear inside a jar of honey and gave it to Lion.
Lion ate Hyena's ear and found it so sweet. He asked Sheep, "Is it possible for me to have the second ear?"
Sheep said, "Yes, it is possible my king." So Lion cut off Hyena's second ear and brought it to Sheep. Sheep put the ear inside a jar of honey and gave it to Lion.
Then Lion said to Sheep, "Is it possible to get the skin?" Sheep replied, "I think it is possible my king." When Hyena heard this he was afraid of dying, and ran. Lion ran after him.
"If such is life in the bush, then it is better for me to return home," said Sheep.

At last, I have learnt to climb down too!

Ape wants to escape from Crocodile.
Ape has an idea.
"I will give you my heart for him," Ape promises.

"Will you fetch your heart?" asks Crocodile. "Yes," says Ape.
Crocodile swims back to the land. Ape runs to the trees.
"You are not my friend. You lied!" says Crocodile.

It was a hot summer day in the dry forest.
Little Ant had no water for many days.
“I need a drop of water, even if it falls from a leaf,” cried Little Ant.
But even the dew had dried up.
“If I do not have water, I will die,” cried Little Ant. “I must go to the river I heard about.”
“The river is full and strong. It will sweep you away,” warned a wise squirrel.
But Little Ant was extremely thirsty. “I will die if I don't drink some water.” So, he went to look for the river.
He walked past tufts of grass and over dry branches.
He walked until he heard water splashing. It was the river! He could hear waves.
Little Ant took a long sip of cool water.
He was so happy he did not see a wave coming.
Little Ant tried to grab some grass floating past him. But he was swept away by the water.
“Help me someone. Help me please!” he called.
“Quick, climb on,” said White Dove, holding a branch in her beak.
“I will stay here until I can thank the dove,” decided Little Ant. “I will wait until she comes back to drink.”
One day as he waited, two boys came to the river. They had their slingshots.
“There is a big white dove that comes here to drink,” said one boy. “We will have it for supper tonight.”
“I cannot let the boys kill White Dove,” thought Little Ant. “But I am so tiny, what can I do?”
Just then White Dove flew down from the tree to drink.
Little Ant had an idea.
He jumped onto one boy's foot. Little Ant bit that boy as hard as he could.
The boy jumped. “Ouch!” he shouted.
White Dove was startled and flew away to safety.
That was how Little Ant thanked White Dove for saving him.

Ammu did not have a puppy.But she told everyone in school that she did.
"My puppy’s name is Simba," she told Venu."Simba eats bananas," she told Abdul."Simba is black," she told Kumari."Simba plays ball with me," she told Unni.
So Venu, Abdul, Kumari, and Unni told Ammu that they would come home.To see Simba. Ammu shook her head."You can’t," she said.
"Why?" they asked."Because Simba is scared of crowds," said Ammu."Then we’ll play with him one by one," said Kumari.
"You can’t," Ammu said."Why?" asked Unni."Because we’re going out today," said Ammu.
"Then we’ll come tomorrow," said Abdul."We’ll bring bananas for him," said Venu."We’ll play with him one by one," said Kumari."Okay," said Ammu.  She didn’t know what else to say.
That evening, Ammu asked Achan if he would buy a puppy for her."We’ll see," said Achan."But it’s urgent," said Ammu. Achan laughed. Ammu didn’t eat dinner. She felt sick.
She didn’t want to think about tomorrow.  In the morning, Amma said, "You look ill."She touched Ammu’s forehead. A fever!
"Stay at home today," Amma said.So Ammu skipped school.She lay in bed all day. She didn’t smile at all.All she ate was a slice of bread.
In the evening, Venu, Abdul, Kumari, and Unni came home."Why didn’t you come to school today?" asked Unni."I am sick," said Ammu.
"We saw Simba," said Abdul."Where?" asked Ammu."In the garden," said Kumari.
"He didn’t want to play ball," said Abdul.Suddenly, Ammu got up from bed. She ran outside.
It was true. There was a puppy in her garden. Simba!"But he’s not black," said Venu. "He’s brown.’""Oh," said Ammu. "I made that up!"
"He’s not afraid of crowds," said Abdul."Oh," said Ammu. "I made that up!"
"He doesn’t like playing ball," said Unni."Oh," said Ammu. "I made that up!"
"But he loves bananas," said Kumari."I told you, didn’t I?" smiled Ammu happily.
a warm morning , Raja woke up with a yawn and said to himself "lets go for fishing now".
While going to the pond,he met Ram,his best friend and invited him to go to the pond together.
Sita saw them going for fishing. The boys asked her if she wanted to come with them.
Sita thought for a moment and said "don't do this,fishes will die when separated by water"
They didn't paid attention to her and continued on their way to the pond.
Raja and Ram sat near the pond and saw to fishes jumping in water,one was a thin and second a fat one.
There came a third fish. They didn't saw any fish bigger than this! Sita said" This fish is even bigger than my father's foot!"
Raja and Ram took their fishing rods with and struggled for the fish.Ram said"its mine!"Raja said"no,its mine!"
Raja pulled the rod, Ram pulled stronger.
BOOM! They fell down as their rods broke.
Do you know why ?Any guesses ?fished tied their strings together!
Long time ago,  there were four little friends namely: Joel, Jonah, Job and Jacob.
They were studying at Busolwe primary school.
The boys used to go to school with out taking tea.
They used to feel sleepy at school all the because of hunger.
One day,  they decided to go to to a nearby trading center called gampe and look for something to eat.
After crossing to a nearby trading center,  they saw a bigger banana bunch in a box at the veranda.
The boys whispered at each other hahahaaaaa. We have been very hungry but,  said Jonah.
All ran to the veranda. Picked up some bananas from the box,  smiled and started eating. Do you now what they forgot to do?
While eating,  the owner of the bananas came walking in bigger strides. ''Who has given you my bananas?'' asked the man.
As soon as they heard that voice,  the boys ran as fast as they could and hid somewhere. They said to each other that no laughing,  no coughing and no talking.
The owner of the bananas made an alarm,  ''wulululululua,  here are the thieves.
The boys were arrested,  taken to school,  called their parents,  the teachers,  and the school children to gather.
The boys were given a punishment. Each got some ten strokes and repented not to steal anything again.
There was a man who didn't want to live close to his neighbours. And he also didn't want his wife to visit the homes of her neighbours.
One day he went and built a home way out in the bush,  far from the homes of his neighbours.
He would go out every day in the morning and come home late at night.
One night the man was very late getting home. A hyena saw what that man was doing.
The hyena went and knocked on the door of the house.
The woman,  thinking it was her husband,  opened the door. The hyena jumped on her and devoured her.
The man,  when he returned home saw that his wife had been eaten by a hyena. There was nothing he could say.
All this happened because he didn't want to live near his neighbours.

I have a friend. She lives in my house.
When I am happy, so is she.
When I cry, she cries too.
But I cannot hear her voice. My friend lives inside the mirror.
“Come out,” I tell her, “we will play.” She does not come out.
I am not happy. I go to sleep.
She comes out of the mirror in my sleep! And we have fun.
We play, we run, we shout and scream together.
When I talk to her, she also talks to me.
In the morning, my friend will go back into the mirror.
But I don't mind at all. We will play again in my dreams!

There was a boy whose name was Abel. He made himself a cart. Abel had no driver for his new cart. He said to his sister Meri, "I want a driver for my cart. Please give me your doll. She can sit in the cart."
But Meri said, "No, I want my doll." When Meri would not let him take the doll, Abel was very angry. He grabbed the doll and pulled her. Meri pulled the doll's other arm. Abel pulled and Meri pulled. The doll's arm came off!
Meri cried and ran to her mother. "Look Mother," she said, "Abel pulled my doll's arm and it came off. He wanted my doll to sit in his new cart but I wanted to play with her." Her mother said, "Abel did not behave well."
Mother thought about how to teach her son not to touch his sister's toys. She had an idea. She went to her friend who was a doctor and she asked, "I want you to help me please." The doctor replied, "How can I help, my friend?"
Mother answered, "My son Abel is behaving badly these days. He pulled the arm off his sister's doll. He must not do that. Tomorrow I will tell him to bring the doll to you to put the doll's arm on again."
"Please tell Abel that he must pay you for your work. He doesn't have any money, so you will tell him to clean your big old car that is always dusty," said mother. Her friend laughed and said, "Ee–ee! That will be good."
Abel's mother went back to her house. She asked Abel, "When you are ill or hurt where do you go?" Abel answered, "When I am ill or hurt, I must go to the doctor." Abel's mother said, "You hurt the doll, now you must take her to the doctor."
So Abel took the doll to the doctor. "This doll is hurt very badly. My mother told me to bring the doll to you. Doctor, can you give her a new arm?" The doctor agreed to look after the doll. She was able to make a new arm.
The doctor said to Abel, "The doll has a new arm. You must pay me. How much money do you have?" Abel answered, "Please doctor, I don't have any money. I can't pay you for your work."
The doctor said, "Well! You don't have any money? My big car is very dirty! Clean my car and that is how you will pay me." Abel got a bucket of water and a clean cloth. It took a long time to wash that dusty car.
Then Abel took the doll back to Meri. She was delighted and she said to Abel, "You are a good brother. Thank you for fixing my doll." "My sister, I'm sorry for getting angry and making you sad," said Abel.
From that day, Abel never took his sister's things again. And he tried his best not to get angry with her.Abel remembered how long it took him to wash the doctor's big, dirty car. He decided it wasn't worth the price to get angry and break things.

Amara was nine years old. She went to Kerema primary school. Her favorite subjects were English, Science and Social Studies. She wanted to be a lawyer when she grew up. Amara loved animals very much.
Amara lived with her mother, Margy. She was a very hardworking farmer. Amara's father died when she was 5 years old.
When Amara was not at school, she spent her time with Mbisa, the goat. She cleaned and fed it.
Amara also had her pet, Simba. Her mother did not like  dogs very much, but she let Amara keep Simba. Whenever Simba disturbed her, she would shout, "Go away before I kick you out." Amara felt sad.
One Saturday, they had visitors from the women's group. Amara was happy that her mother's friends had come with their children. They could play football.
Her mother had prepared the food that the group liked. Amara was reminded by her mother to keep Simba locked up. It barked at strangers.
Amara did not hear her mother calling because they were busy playing.
When Amara went to the house, she called Simba out. Simba was very obedient to Amara. After the meal, the visitors said, "We'll also treat our dogs well like Amara. We mistreat them and yet they are so helpful."
Afterwards, Amara's mother apologised for being mean and cruel to  Simba. Amara was happy that her mother accepted her dog at last. When Amara is in school her mother feeds Simba. Her mother's friends have learned to be good to their dogs.
One day, mother was cooking. She called, "Abena, Ajua, Akwasi, Aku, food is ready!  Bring your plates!"  Mother gave each of them some fufu. She gave them some soup. Then she gave them some meat. She said to them, "Go and sit down and eat."
Aku looked at her fufu. She looked at her soup. Then she looked at her meat. She put her plate down angrily and cried. Mother asked, "Aku, what is wrong with you?""My meat is the smallest," Aku cried. "But you are the youngest," mother said.
Aku cried harder. She threw herself on the ground. Mother did not want Aku to cry. She called loudly, "Abena, Ajua, Akwasi, bring your food quickly!"The children brought their food. "Now Aku, pick the meat you like," mother said.
Aku smiled happily. She looked hard at Akwasi's meat and thought, "Akwasi's meat is big." She looked hard at Ajua's meat, and thought, "Ajua's meat is bigger." She looked hard at Abena's meat. Abena's meat was the biggest. She said to mother, "I want Abena's meat."
"Abena, give your meat to Aku and take hers," mother said. Abena was unhappy.  But she did not want to disobey mother. So she gave her meat to Aku. "Mmmm, this meat will be sweet," Aku said. She sat on a stool and ate happily.
Pii! Pii! It was the ice cream man outside. He rode a big bicycle with a small horn. Aku loved ice cream. "Abena, get my bag," mother said. "I want to buy ice cream for all of you." Abena brought mother's bag.
"Four ice creams, please," mother said to the ice cream man. She paid and gave each child an ice cream. "One, two, three, four," counted Aku. She looked at her ice cream. It was small. She looked hard at Akwasi's ice cream.  It was smaller than hers.
She looked harder at Ajua's ice cream. It was the smallest of all. She was happy. "My ice cream is the biggest," she thought. "Wait," she thought. "I must see Abena's ice cream too." She moved closer to Abena. Then she opened her mouth wide and cried.
"What is the matter, Aku?" mother asked.  "Abena's ice cream is bigger than mine," she cried. Mother said, "Aku you are a greedy girl!" Aku cried harder.  She threw herself on the ground. Mother was unhappy. She did not want Aku to cry.
Mother said to Abena, "Please give your ice cream to Aku and take hers." Abena was unhappy, but she did not want to disobey mother. She gave the ice cream to Aku. Aku's eyes shone with happiness. She looked at the big ice cream and smiled.
"Mmmm, this ice cream looks good," said Aku. She opened her mouth wide and took a big bite. "Ajiish!" she shouted suddenly and spat out the ice cream."What is the matter now?" mother asked. "This ice cream is bitter," wailed Aku.
Mother took Aku's ice cream and bit into it. She frowned. "There is something wrong with this. It is spoilt," she said. Then mother added, "Sorry Aku, you cannot have another one. Now do you see that it is bad to be greedy?"
Mother is on a holiday today. She was sitting and reading a book. Even Anil was on a holiday. He wanted to do something or the other. "Mama, what is there in the blue trunk? I want to see!" Said Anil."Anil, let's see later" replied the mother.
Anil brought a stool and kept in on the chair and climbed to bring down the blue trunk."No, no! no! Anil, whatever more trunks are on top of that will all fall on our heads!"  Said the mother.
Anil became very angry. He was angry on his mother too.
" Let's go to the market and let's buy you something," said the mother.
Even after going to the market Anil was very angry. "I want that" he kept showing his finger while looking at the orange."No, no! Not that! All the fruits will fall down!" Said the fruit vendor.
"I want that book" said Anil."No, no! Not that! Take this." Said the shopkeeper.
"I want that!" Anil said it in the interest of taking one samosa. "No, no! Not that! All my samosa's will fall down!" Said the sweet vendor.
"I want that!" said Anil. "No, no! Not that! Don't even touch it! The flowers will dry up." Said the flower vendor.
Now Anil started to cry loudly.Everyone was looking at Anil.
"I want that!  It is black!", Said the mother.Anil suddenly stopped to cry.Mother, no, no! Not that!" Said Anil.
Let's take the colour of the mud.!" Said Anil. Anil slowly picked up a mud color puppy."Mother, I am very angry on you! All the puppies would have fallen down!"Mother laughed. Even Anil was laughing. Now then he wasn't angry at all.

Ngô-Iwa stole the ten eggs and put them in her bag.
Ngô-Iwa kept the eggs warm. She wanted them to hatch.

When Ngô-Iwa denied, Crocodile asked all animals about her eggs.
Meanwhile,  the eggs hatched one by one when Ngô-Iwa went hunting.
Ngô-Iwa could not give the young crocodiles enough food.
One day, Crocodile heard the young crocodiles crying for food!
Crocodile entered the hut and hit Ngô-Iwa with her tail.

Today is  Vasant Panchami. My parents say it is the first day of spring. Spring is the season between winter and summer. It is called Vasant Ritu in Sanskrit.
In many parts of India, people pray to the goddess of learning, music and art on this day. Many birds are sitting on the tree near my house. I think they are singing to me.
The leaves on the tree are new and shiny. Just like my new frock. Amma is also wearing a yellow sari ― such a pretty colour ‘basanti’, and such a pretty name!
Grandpa wants me to plant a tree. “But why?” I ask. “So that you will have a friend to grow up with, Meenu,” he says. “Spring is a good season to start something new.”
We go to the garden. Grandpa and I dig a hole in the ground and plant a sapling. “How tall will it grow?” I ask him.
"Wait and watch, dear Meenu!" he says. The squirrels are chasing each other. Tingu, the cat, chases a squirrel. And I want to chase Tingu.
The garden is full of flowers.I like the yellow roses the best and Grandpa likes the white jasmine.There is a carpet of leaves under some trees.
Many trees have flowers. I like spring! Everything looks so pretty in spring!
Tomorrow is Holi. School is closed for two days. We have made a huge Holika with twigs, and pieces of wood. Some of us went to the forest and brought tesu flowers. Manu put the flowers in a tank of water. The water has turned a bright orange!
Tomorrow we will play Holi with the orange water. We will get gujia and puris to eat. Spring is such a happy season. It is not cold, it is not hot, and it is not wet. I  can play all the time!
“I can’t lift you up, Shanu!” says Ammi. “You are too big!”
“You can’t walk to school alone, Shanu!” says Abbu. “You are too small!”
“You can’t sleep in the baby’s cot, Shanu!” says Dadu. “You are too big!”
“You can’t carry the baby to the park, Shanu!” says Dadi. “You are too small!”
Shanu is puzzled. Too big! Too small! How can she be too big andtoo small all at once?
Too big to wear her old pink frock.Too small to make dosas at the stove.
Too big to climb up on Dadu’s back?Too smallto carry the baby on hers?
“What am I the right size for?” Shanu wonders.
“You are just big enough to take me for my morning walks,” says Dadu.
“And you are just small enough for me to tell stories to,” says Dadi.
“And you will always, always be the perfect size...for this!" all say, and give her a warm, wonderful hug.
Long, long ago, the Sky God, Nyame, kept all stories locked in a wooden box, high in the sky. People down on earth had no stories to tell and they were very sad. They asked Anansi the clever Spider to help them.
Anansi spun a long thread, and climbed up his sticky thread all the way to heaven. “Can I have the stories, please?” he asked the Sky God. But Nyame laughed at Anansi and said, “Oh, these are very expensive stories. You wouldn't be able to pay for them, little spider.”
“How much do the stories cost?” asked Anansi. “You'll have to bring me three rare and fierce animals,” Nyame answered, “A leopard with sharp teeth like spears, a hornet that stings people, and a snake that swallows people whole.” He laughed and laughed. He thought his stories were quite safe.
So Anansi climbed slowly back down his sticky thread to the earth. He thought and he thought, and he came up with a plan. He dug a deep hole, covered it with branches and dirt so it was hidden, and he went home for supper. In the morning, sure enough, a leopard had fallen into his pit. He was furiously scratching at the side of the pit, but he couldn't get out.
“Oh let me help you, my dear friend!” said Anansi. “Just lie down on these sticks and I'll pull you out.” Anansi wound his sticky web round the leopard and the sticks, and pulled him up to heaven to show the Sky God. But Nyame just laughed and said, “Where are the other two?”
So Anansi went back down to earth to get the second creature. He thought and he thought and he came up with a plan. He took a gourd full of water and went to the tree where the hornets lived. He poured out some of the water all over their nest. Then he cut a leaf from a banana tree and held it over his head, and he poured the rest of the water all over himself.
He called out to the hornets, “Hey hornets! Come see! It is raining! Quick ­get inside my gourd and it will keep all of you dry.” Hornets don't like to get wet, so they all flew into Anansi's gourd.
Then Anansi quickly spun a web across the opening so the hornets couldn't get out no matter how much they buzzed. He carried them up to heaven and showed them to the Sky God. But Nyame just said, “Where's the last one?” (He wasn't laughing so much anymore.).
So Anansi went down to earth again. He thought and thought and he thought, but he couldn't come up with a plan. So he asked his wife, who had a very good idea. Together they found a good long thick branch and some strong vines. When they got near the stream where the snake lived, they began to argue. “The branch is longer!” “No, it isn't!” “Yes it is!”
Soon the snake came out and asked what the argument was. “I was arguing with my wife,” said Anansi. “She says this stick is longer than you are. But I don't agree.” “Of course I'm longer than that stick!” said the snake. “I'm very long! I'm a huge snake! Just put your stick next to me and measure!”
So Anansi did that, and he tied the snake to the stick with his vine to keep him straight. When he was all tied up, Anansi took the snake up to heaven.
Nyame had to admit that Anansi had paid his price. So he went to his wooden box, opened the lid, and gave all the stories to Anansi. Anansi carried the stories triumphantly down to earth. He shared them with his wife, and with all the other animals and people. Stories are for telling, not for keeping in wooden boxes.
"Mom," calls Lebo. "Come and look. These clothes are all too small for me!" "Let me see," says Mom.
"Look at my skirt. It's too small," says Lebo. "Yes,  it is," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your skirt."
"Look at my jeans. They're too small," says Lebo. "Yes, they are," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your jeans."
"Look at my T-shirt. It's too small," says Lebo. "Yes, it is," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your T-shirt."
"Look at my jersey. It's too small," says Lebo. "Yes, it is," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your jersey."
"Look at my raincoat. It's too small," says Lebo. "Yes, it is," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your raincoat."
"Look at my socks. They're too small," says Lebo. "Yes, they are," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your socks."
"Look at my shoes. They're too small," says Lebo. "Yes, they are," says Mom. "Nomsa can have your shoes."
"Now you have lots of clothes," says Lebo. "Oh no I don't," says Nomsa. "These clothes are all too big for me!"
Once upon a time, there was a hungry jackal. He was walking around the bush looking for food.
He came across a grapevine. He spotted a bunch of juicy ripe grapes hanging from a high branch.
"Those look really delicious," he thought. He took a few steps back so that he could make his highest jump.
The grapes were too high. Jackal fell on his back without even touching the bunch.
Jackal got up and went further back from his starting spot. He ran, and almost got high enough. But he fell even harder.
He tried again and again. But he couldn't get to the grapes. He kept falling until his back was very sore.
Finally, he gave up and walked away.
He stopped and looked back at the grapes. He was hungrier than ever. "Those grapes look really sour anyway," he thought.

There was a spider called Anansi. Anansi was too lazy to cook his own food. Instead, he used to visit his friends and eat the delicious food they had cooked.
One day, Anansi was passing Rabbit's house when he smelled green vegetables cooking. He was very excited. Rabbit said to Anansi, “They're not quite ready yet. You can help me to wash up while we wait.” Anansi replied, “Sorry, I have things to do. I'll come back later.”
“How will I call you when they're ready?” asked Rabbit. Anansi thought for a minute. “I'll spin a web,” he said. “I'll tie one end around my leg and one end to your pot. When the greens are ready, pull on the web string. I'll come right away.” So Anansi tied the web to the pot, and walked on.
Anansi saw Monkey and his wife, cooking beans in a large pot. “Come and join us! The beans are nearly ready.” Monkey said. Anansi replied, “Sorry, I have things to do. Let me tie one end of this web around my leg and one end to your pot. When the beans are ready, pull on the web string, and I'll come.”
As Anansi walked by Warthog's house, he smelled sweet potatoes. Warthog told Anansi, “My pot is full of sweet potatoes and honey! Come and share my food with me. Take this fork and help me to stir it.” Anansi replied, “I'll come back later. Let me tie one end of this web around my leg and one end to your pot. When the sweet potatoes areready, pull on the web string, and I'll come.”
By the time Anansi arrived at the river, each of his eight legs was tied to a pot of delicious food. Then, Anansi felt a pull on one of his legs. “Rabbit's food is ready!” Anansi thought, licking his lips.
He felt a second pull. And a third. And a fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth pull. Everyone was pulling on the web strings at the same time! “Stop! Stop!” he cried in pain, as his legs were stretched thinner and thinner. But no one could hear him.
Finally, the web strings could hold no longer. They snapped, one by one. Anansi rolled into the river to soothe his painful legs. But his legs would not return to their normal shape. Anansi was too embarrassed to go to any of his friends that day.

Dhushh! Tsshh! With the speed of the tapping of my hands, you won't be able to see it.
There are so many things I really want to be.What about tomorrow?
One day an elephant was going to drink water.
There were two giraffes who were also going to drink water.
There were three Buffaloes and four birds. They were all going to drink water.
Five impalas and six warthogs were also going to drink water.
Seven frogs and eight fishes were in the water.
Nine Zebras were going to drink water.
One lion was going to drink water.
Off all the animals, who is the toughest of them all and will be the first one to drink water?
Goat, Dog and Cow were great friends.One day they went on a journey in a taxi.
They reached the end of their journey.The driver asked them to pay their fares.Cow paid her fare.
Dog paid extra, because he did not have the correct money.
The driver was about to give Dog his change.Suddenly Goat ran away without paying.
The driver was very annoyed.He drove away without giving Dog his change.
That is why, even today, Dog runs towards a car to peep inside.He is looking for the driver who owes him change.
Goat runs away from the sound of a car.She is afraid she will be arrested for not paying her fare.
Cow is not bothered by cars.Cow takes her time crossing the road.She knows she paid her fare in full.
Everyone knows that the elephant has a very long nose.
But a long time ago, the elephant's nose was short and fat. Like a shoe in the middle of its face.
One day a baby elephant was born. She was curious about everything. She had a question for every animal.
She was curious about Giraffe. “Why do you have a long neck?” she asked.
She was curious about Rhino. “Why does your horn have a sharp point?”
She was curious about Hippo. “Why do you have red eyes?” she asked.
And she was VERY curious about Crocodile. “What does Crocodile eat for dinner?” she asked.
﻿“Never ask a question like that!” said her mother. Then she walked off, frowning.
Quickly Crow flew down to baby elephant.“Follow me to the river. There you will see what Crocodile eats for dinner,” squawked Crow.
So the baby elephant followed Crow down to the river.
She pushed through the reeds and stood on the bank. She looked into the water. Where was Crocodile?
“Hello,” said a stone near the river bank.“Hello,” said Baby Elephant. “Can you tell me what Crocodile eats for dinner?” she asked.
“Bend down and I will tell you,” said the stone. “Lower, lower,” said the stone. So Baby Elephant bent down lower, and lower.
Then suddenly, “Snap!” Baby Elephant's nose was caught in Crocodile's jaws.“Crocodile will eat you for dinner!” squawked Crow, and flew away.
Baby Elephant sat back on her strong legs and pulled. She pulled, and pulled. But Crocodile did not let go of her nose.
Baby Elephant's nose stretched, and stretched, and stretched. Then, “Thud!” she fell on her back.
Crocodile sunk back into the water. He was cross about losing his dinner.
Baby Elephant looked at her nose. It was stretched very long. She could not see where it ended!
Her nose was so long she could pick fruit from high branches.
Her nose was so long she could shower her back with water. From that day, all elephants had long and useful trunks.
It’s Monday morning and Thabo’s family is getting ready for the day.

My name is Shyam, I am ten years old. i'm a little skinny, but very bold!Waking up for school is no fun at allso sleepy as I get up, I think i might fall!
My eyes close as I begin to brush,I hear mom making dosas in a rush.My mind slowly wanders away,and many, many ideas come into play.
What is my neck was ten times as long?half in school, half at home, where would I belong?
What if my legs were as tall as trees?My school building would only come up to my knees!
What if my arms were strong enough ?Then, lifting Mumma would not be tough!
What if there was nothing too hard for my teeth ?Just think of all the things I could eat!
What if my belly were as round as could be ?All my friends could jump and bounce off me!
What if I had big and floppy ears?I could hear everything, far and near!
What if - I begin, but Mumma walks in,"Riddhi, you'll be late, what are you thinking about?"
I find myself still standing with my brush in my hand, And I smile and think of my secret little land.

My best teacher is a tall woman  with a light skin complexion.
She always makes her lessons interesting because of the stories from the past that she always tells us.
She brings songs that we sing in the lessons when we are bored   and we always dance to the songs.
She cares about all the students,  advises them and helps them solve their problems.   She is like a mother to us.
She always talks to the students about their   marks and advices them to improve.
She sometimes disciplines the naughty students that misbehave in her class.
My best teacher is so inspiring and is the best teacher any student could have.
Long,  long ago,  the sky god,  Nyame,  kept all stories locked in a wooden box, high in the sky. People down on earth had no stories to tell and they were very sad. They asked Anansi the Spider to help them.
Anansi spun a long thread,  and climbed up his sticky thread all the way to heaven. "Can I have the stories,  please?" he asked the sky god. But Nyame laughed at Anansi and said, "Oh,  these are very expensive stories. You wouldn't be able to pay for them, little spider."
"How much do the stories cost?" asked Anansi. "You'll have to bring me three rare and fierce animals," Nyame answered. "Bring a leopard with sharp teeth like spears, a hornet that stings people, and a snake that swallows people whole," said Nyame, laughing. He thought his stories were quite safe.
So Anansi climbed slowly back down his sticky thread to the earth. He thought and he thought, and he came up with a plan. He dug a deep hole, covered it with branches and dirt so it was hidden. He went home for supper. In the morning, sure enough, a leopard had fallen into his pit. He was furiously scratching at the side of the pit, but he couldn't get out.
"Oh, let me help you,  my dear friend!" said Anansi to the leopard. "Just lie down on these sticks and I'll pull you out." Anansi wound his sticky web round the leopard and the sticks, and pulled him up to heaven to show the sky god. But Nyame just laughed and said,  "Where are the other two?"
Anansi went back to earth to get the second creature. He thought and he thought and he came up with a plan. He filled a gourd with water and picked a banana leaf, and then went to the tree where the hornets lived. He held the banana leaf over his head and poured half the water over himself.
Anansi poured the rest of the water over the hornets' nest. He shouted, "Hey hornets! It is raining! Quick, get inside my gourd and it will keep you dry."Hornets don't like to get wet,  so they all flew into Anansi's gourd.
Anansi quickly spun a web across the opening of the gourd. The hornets couldn't get out, no matter how much they buzzed. He carried the gourd up to heaven and showed the sky god. But Nyame just said,  "Where's the last one?" (He wasn't laughing so much anymore.)
Anansi went down to earth again. He thought and thought and he thought, but he couldn't come up with a plan. So he asked his wife, who had a very good idea. They found a long thick branch and some strong vines. Then, they went to the stream where the snake lived, and began to argue. "The branch is longer!" "No, it isn't!" "Yes it is!"
Soon the snake came out and asked what the argument was. "I was arguing with my wife," said Anansi. "She says this stick is longer than you are. But I don't agree." The snake exclaimed, "Of course I'm longer than that stick! I'm very long! I'm a huge snake! Just put your stick next to me and measure!"
Anansi did that. And to keep the snake straight, Anansi tied him to the stick with the strong vine.After tying up the snake, Anansi took him to the sky god.
Nyame had to admit that Anansi had paid his price. He went to his wooden box, opened the lid, and gave all the stories to Anansi. Anansi carried the stories triumphantly down to earth. He shared them with his wife, and with all the other animals and people. Stories are for telling,  not for keeping in wooden boxes.
Anansi the Spider, and Rabbit were friends. They lived in a peaceful village in the mountains. Rabbit owned a big farm with lots of vegetables and fruit. Even though Rabbit shared generously with his friend, Anansi was unhappy and jealous.
So Anansi thought of a clever plan to take over Rabbit's farm. Soon Rabbit was left poor and homeless. Anansi was the proud owner of all Rabbit's land, vegetables, and fruit.
Anansi went to the market to sell his fruit and vegetables. He made so much money that he filled a big basket with it! With some of the money, he bought maize for his family, and put it on top of the money in the basket.
Anansi happily headed home with his basket on his head, singing. He was thinking about all the things he was going to buy with his money.
On the way, it started to drizzle. Soon the drizzle turned into a heavy downpour. Anansi the Spider left his basket on the side of the road to shelter under a tree. But from there he kept a close watch on his precious basket.
It started to rain even more heavily, and Anansi was getting cold and wet. So he ran into a hole. "I will stay in this hole until the rain stops," said Anansi to himself. "At least my money is protected by the maize I put on top of it."
A little while later, Vulture was flying around and spotted the basket on the side of the road. He saw that there was money and maize in the basket. So he covered the basket with his wings and waited for the rain to stop.
Anansi saw Vulture sitting on his basket. "Oh thank you, my friend, for protecting my basket," he said to the Vulture. "Excuse me, Anansi, did I hear you right?" asked Vulture. "Your basket? This basket is mine! I found it here on the road side!" Anansi could not believe his ears! "It's mine, I tell you!"
Furious, Anansi went and reported the theft to the chief. But Vulture said to the chief and his elders, "How could anyone leave a basket full of money and maize unguarded on the road?" "But I was watching my basket," said Anansi. "It's my money and my maize!" "I was looking after the basket when you came and said it was yours!" replied Vulture.
When the chief and his elders had listened carefully to both sides, they sent Anansi and Vulture away. They discussed the story for a long time. Eventually they reached a decision.
They summoned Anansi and the Vulture again. "We believe Vulture's story," they said. "He is not the thief. You were trying to claim something that was not yours." Anansi could not believe his ears! He burst into tears.
The news soon spread that the judgement had gone against Anansi. As he walked away, he heard Rabbit laughing and laughing. Rabbit went back to his farm and grew fruit and vegetables. But Anansi was poor again, with no friends.
Once upon a time, there lived a happy family.
The children never fought with each other. They helped their parents at home and in the fields.
But they were not allowed to go near a fire.
They had to do all their work during the night.Because they weremade of wax!
But one of the boys longed to go out in the sunlight.
One day the longing was too strong. His brother and sister warned him.
But it was too late! Hemelted in the hot sun.
The wax children cried to see their brother melting away.
But they made a plan. They shaped the lump of melted wax into a bird.
They took their bird brother up to a high mountain.
And as the sun rose,he flew away, singing in the morning light.
Knock! Knock!
"Who is there?" I ask sleepily.
"It is me," a shrill voice says.
"Who is 'me'?" I ask.
"I told you,  it is o-n-l-y m-e," the same voice says.
"I don't know anyone called,  'o-n-l-y m-e'," I reply. I check that my mosquito net is tucked in around my bed.
"Well, my name is Amos." The voice sounds more shrill than before. It is very close to my ear.
"Amos who?" I ask as I look under the net.
"Amos Quito," the voice finally says. I feel a bite on my ear.
"Ouch!" I jump up and begin to search. "You will pay for this!" I shout.
Angrily, I get out of bed and switch on the light.
I declare war on the annoying Amos Quito!

It was evening. The birds were chirping and flying back to their nests.Putti and Akka were walking back from the park.
"Look, Akka! There's a butterfly on the bush!" said Putti."A butterfly? Look again!" said Akka."Huh?" said Putti.
They passed by Parvati's house."Akka, look, Parvati's dog is wearing ponytails today!" said Putti.Akka giggled. "You funny girl! Look again!" she said."Huh?" said Putti.
They walked past the big old Gulmohar tree."Akka! A snake!" screamed Putti and clung to Akka."Oh Putti, look again!" said Akka."Haaaa!" said Putti, and relaxed.
They passed by Raghav's house."Akka, how did Raghav's mother's hair grow long so quickly? I saw her yesterday and she had short hair!" said Putti.Akka laughed. "Putti, Putti, look again!""Aha!" said Putti.
They went past the old library."Ooooh Akka!" said Putti. "Have you ever seen such a big fruit on such a small plant?""You're seeing things today, Putti!" Akka said, laughing and ruffling Putti's hair. "Look again!""Aaaah!" said Putti.
"Walk faster, Putti, it's getting dark!" said Akka. "Look, the streetlights have been turned on!""Eeeeeeeee! A monster!" shouted Putti."Aw, look again, Putti!" said Akka."Phhshhhhh!" sighed Putti, relieved.
Putti and Akka reached home."Look, Putti! Aren't these Ajji's slippers?" asked Akka.*Ajji: Kannada for grandmother
They peered in through the window."Yes, Putti! Ajji is here! She said she would bring chakli!" said Akka.*Chakli: a fried, crunchy snack made with rice flour and gram flour.
"Better look again, Akka," said Putti. "What if that is not Ajji? What if it's someone else wearing a saree? What if it's just a saree draped over a chair? What if it's just a bundle of clothes. What if..."
"Look again, Putti!" said Akka.It WAS Ajji! And she had brought chakli!

Long ago, there was a clever cat and a foolish dog. The clever cat lived well in a wealthy family's house. The foolish dog starved on the street.
"How is it that a wealthy family allows you to live in their house?" the foolish dog angrily asked the clever cat.
The clever cat replied, "I live with people because I'm neat and I bury my waste. I ask for food saying, meow."
"If I do the same, will they allow me to live in a house?" asked the dog. The cat replied, "Yes, do what I have told you and they will allow you. They will give you food."
The foolish dog said, "Today, I will not hurt you." "He almost got me this time. I don't want to meet him again," said the cat, jumping away.
Based on the cat's advice, the foolish dog barked loudly at the door of a house.
The owners of the house beat him with a stick. "The cat fooled me. I will eat her when I get her," shouted the foolish dog.
While the cat was playing outside her house, the dog grabbed her. He said, "Last time you fooled me. You told me to bark at the gate of a house. The owners beat me. Now I will eat you."
"Listen dog, you can eat me, but let me play a little first. Just as I allow a rat to play before I eat her," replied the clever cat.
The dog asked, "How does the rat play?" The cat replied, "I let it go a little, and I tell it to count to three. While the rat is counting, I grab it."
The foolish dog let the cat go free and told her to count to three. The clever cat escaped and climbed up a tree. "Come down from the tree and count to three," asked the dog.
The clever cat answered, "Listen dog, you will never get me again. I'm not a fool. You can count to a hundred, a thousand or a million but you will never get me again!"

Prem studied in class two. He went to the municipal school near his house. His teacher was always bubbling with new ideas.
One day, she asked the children to find and fill an empty matchbox.“Fill the matchbox with as many different things as you can, over one week. The one who packs in the most number of different things will get a prize next week.”
Prem liked theidea. At home, Prem tried to put his eraser and pencil sharpener in thematchbox. He managed to fit in only one. They were too big. This made himthink. What are the things I can put in?
While he was doing his homework, the lead from Prem's pencil broke and fell off. He put the piece in his matchbox. After sharpening his pencil, he put a small wood shaving in his matchbox.Prem started looking carefully for tiny things.
He could smell the poha his mother wascooking. In the kitchen, he found a small mustard seed, a cumin seed, and aseed of a red chilli. He put them in along with a grain each of sugar, rice andwheat. He added grains of maize, millet, green gram and other pulses.
The next day, heput in a small rubber band, a piece of wool, one strand of hair, and a piece ofthread.Prem now kept looked for tiny, teeny-weeny things. Thenext day, he added a rose thorn, a sunflower petal, a small twig, a tea leaf, atamarind leaf and a small stone.
There was still some space in thematchbox. So Prem put in a small piece of paper, a pin, a needle, a bead, anail and a small button.The matchbox was still not full. On the last day of theweek, Prem put in a lemon seed, an orange seed, and a pumpkin seed. Now thematchbox was packed. It couldn’t hold any more.
At school, eachchild counted the number of things stuffed in his or her matchbox. Somechildren had collected fifty things. One child had managed to stuff over ahundred things.
When it was Prem’s turn, he shook hismatchbox in the air. There was not a sound because it was stuffed fully! WhenPrem emptied his matchbox, everyone was surprised.
He had stuffed over a hundred-and-fifty little things in his matchbox! No one had come even close to him.So Prem won a new box of crayons!
Little Ant loved to read. Little Ant was often teased. “Ants don’t read. Ants must feed. Ants collect the food they need.”
Little Ant would read all day, he’d read and read the day away.
The other ants took what they found to store for winter underground.
His mum and dad got really mad, and Little Ant felt really bad.
In autumn when the leaves fall down.
The ants must keep food underground.
The Queen wants food to fill the store, so all the ants must work some more.
Little Ant begins to shout about a place he read about. “A restaurant is what we need, a place where people go to feed. It says so in the books I read.”
The ants go marching one by one. They march into the setting sun.
And Little Ant said “Hey, there’s one!”
The ants go marching one by one, carrying a burger, carrying a bun.
When they return the Queen is glad. The stores are full. They cheer like mad.
Ant gets hugs from mum and dad.
His baby sister takes his hand “Now I think I understand.” “The way you love to read a book … Makes me want to take alook.”
Foxy Joxy was a sly fox. He sold big, fresh watermelons.Watermelons for sale!
“Your price is too high,” said Rabbit Jabbit.“You are asking too much,” said Gia Giraffe.
Foxy Joxy had a clever idea.
He slit open a big watermelon,
scooped out the fruit,
and gobbled it up.
Then he filled it with water!He took a needle and thread and sewed the watermelon back together.
He sold his watermelons for a cheap price.Many animals bought from Foxy Joxy.
“This watermelon has only water in it,” complained Funky Monkey.
“Well, you got what you paid for,” said Foxy Joxy.
“We need to teach Foxy Joxy a lesson,” said Ellie Elephant.
The animals gathered around and came up with a plan.“I have an idea,” said Oliver Owl.
They took an empty watermelon,
stuffed Foxy Joxy into it...
and played a game of football with it.
Foxy Joxy was dizzy!He learnt his lesson and never cheated again.
