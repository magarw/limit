Wanakijiji walimwita Kobani, Muungwana, kwa sababu alikuwa mpole na rafiki wa watu. Hakuwa kama watu wengine wakubwa tunaosoma juu yao katika hadithi za kutisha. \n\nWakati wa mchana, Kobani alifanya kazi yake shambani. Mpini wa jembe lake ulikuwa mfupi mno kwa hivyo alilazimika kuinama hadi chini kuifanya kazi yake. Bila shaka, mgongo wake ulikuwa na maumivu mengi kutokana na kuinama kwingi.", "Theuri aliishi karibu na Kobani. Alihuzunika sana alipomwona Kobani akipambana na jembe lake lenye mpini mfupi au alipoinama chini ili apite mlangoni kwake. \n\nTheuri aliamua kumsaidia Kobani. Alizungumza na wazee wa kijiji na kuwauliza usaidizi. Lakini, kabla wao kufanya hivyo, walitaka kujua urefu kamili wa Kobani.", "Theuri alimwuliza Kobani, \"Wewe ni mrefu kiasi gani?\" Kobani alikisia akasema, \"Nadhani urefu wangu ni mita 2.5.\" Kobani alilala kitandani halafu akamweleza, \"Ninajua godoro langu ni refu mita 1.5. Unaona hata miguu yangu inaning'inia mwisho karibu mita nyingine. Hiyo ina maana kuwa mimi ni mrefu mita 2.5.\"\n\nSasa Theuri angeweza kuwaeleza wazee kwamba Kobani ni mrefu mita 2.5. Alikuwa mrefu kweli!", "Theuri angeweza kuanza kutekeleza mpango wake wa siri. \n\nTheuri, Kobani na Choke, kipenzi chake, waliondoka kwenda sokoni. Waliitumia baiskeli ya Kobani iliyokuwa ndogo. Kobani alilazimika kuunyoosha mguu wake ili aweze kuiendesha ile baiskeli. Theuri aliketi kikapuni akiogopa kutazama barabara namna baiskeli ilivyoyumbayumba kila upande.", "Waliposhuka sokoni, umati wa wanakijiji ulimzunguka Kobani. Chifu wa kijiji alimkaribisha. \"Hujambo Bwana Muungwana. Theuri alitueleza kuwa unakumbwa na matatizo maishani mwako kutokana na urefu wako,\" Chifu alisema. \n\nAliendelea kumwambia, \"Tunataka kukusaidia. Tutahakikisha kuwa kila kitu unachohitaji kinakufaa. Hivi karibuni, matatizo yako yatazikwa katika kaburi la sahau. Subiri tu ujionee.\"", "Wanakijiji walifanya kazi mfululizo kuhakikisha kuwa chochote Kobani alihitaji kilikuwa kimetengenezwa kwa kimo kilichomfaa.\n\nLitazame jembe hili. Ulinganishe mpini wa jembe jipya na ule mzee. Mpini mpya unaonekana kuwa mrefu mara mbili. Unadhani hilo jembe jipya ni refu kiasi gani? Zaidi ya mita moja? Chini ya mita mbili?", "Baadaye, wanakijiji walimsaidia Kobani kutengeneza fremu refu na mlango mpya uliokuwa mrefu. Fremu ilikuwa ndefu kumliko Kobani ili asiiname sana atakapokuwa akiingia nyumbani. Ilikuwa ya kumfaa hasa!\n\nHebu ichunguze ile picha kwa makini. Urefu wa Kobani ni takriban mita 2.5. Je, unadhani fremu ya mlango wake mpya ni refu kiasi gani?", "Halafu walitengeneza kitanda kipya na godoro lililokuwa refu zaidi. Vilevile walinunua shuka na blanketi ya kuufunika mwili wa Kobani kutoka kichwani hadi miguuni. \n\nSasa, Kobani angetazamia kulala usingizi kwa amani. Miguu yake haitaning'inia kando ya godoro tena. Tazama jinsi mwili wake ulivyofunikwa kabisa. Hata kuna nafasi iliyobaki upande mmoja wa kitanda.", "Chifu alimwuliza mmoja wa wahunzi wa mle kijijini\nkumtengenezea Kobani baiskeli kubwa. Baiskeli hiyo ilikuwa na kikapu kikubwa ambamo Theuri na Choke wangeketi. \n\nKila sehemu ya baiskeli hiyo ilikuwa kimo cha kumfaa Kobani. Kobani hakuhitajika tena kuikokota miguu yake barabarani wala kuining'iniza kando ya baiskeli.", "Maseremala walimtengenezea Kobani meza mpya iliyokuwa na miguu mirefu ya mita 1.5. Sasa anapoketi kula, miguu yake inagusa chini. \n\nTheuri huketi kwenye kigoda kirefu karibu naye. Yeye huhitaji ngazi ili afike juu. Hesabu vidato ambavyo Theuri anastihili kupanda ili amfikie Kobani. Je, unadhani ngazi hiyo ni refu kiasi gani?", "Jembe jipya la Kobani humwezesha kupanda mimea na kuvuna kwa urahisi. Bustani yake ilibadilika na kuwa msitu! Kobani huwaachia wanakijiji vikapu vya matunda mbele ya mlango wa nyumba yake kuonyesha shukuruni zake kwa msaada wao. \n\nNa hili lilianza na ndoto aliyokuwa nayo Theuri ya kutaka kumrahisishia maisha rafiki yake, Kobani Muungwana."], "Amharic": ["\u12f6\u121b\u12cd \u1260\u1323\u121d \u12a0\u132d\u122d \u1290\u1260\u1228\u127d\u1362", "\u1260\u1229 \u1260\u1323\u121d \u12a0\u1325\u122e\u1260\u1275 \u1290\u1260\u122d\u1362", "\u12a0\u120d\u130b\u12cd\u121d \u1260\u1323\u121d \u12a0\u1325\u122e\u1260\u1275 \u1290\u1260\u122d\u1362", "\u1265\u1235\u12ad\u120c\u1271\u121d \u1260\u1323\u121d \u12a0\u1325\u122b\u1260\u1275 \u1290\u1260\u122d\u1362", "\u12ed\u1205 \u1230\u12cd\u12ec \u1260\u1323\u121d \u1228\u1305\u121d \u1290\u1260\u122d\u1362", "\u1228\u1305\u121d \u12f6\u121b \u1230\u122b\u1362", "\u1228\u1305\u121d \u1260\u122d\u121d \u1230\u122b\u1362", "\u12a0\u120d\u130b\u12cd\u1295\u121d \u1228\u1305\u121d \u12a0\u12f5\u122d\u130e \u1230\u122b\u12cd\u1362", "\u1275\u120d\u1245 \u1265\u1235\u12ad\u120c\u1275\u121d \u1308\u12db\u1362", "\u1275\u120d\u1245 \u12c8\u1295\u1260\u122d\u121d \u120b\u12ed \u1270\u1240\u1218\u1320\u1362 \u1260\u1275\u120d\u1245 \u1239\u12ab\u121d \u1260\u120b\u1362", "\u1264\u1271\u1295\u121d \u1275\u1276 \u1260\u132b\u12ab \u12cd\u1235\u1325 \u1218\u1296\u122d \u1300\u1218\u1228\u1362 \u1208\u1228\u1305\u121d \u130a\u12dc\u121d \u1296\u1228\u1362"], "Afrikaans": ["Sy skoffel was te kort.", "Sy deur was te laag.", "Sy bed was te kort.", "Sy fiets was te klein.", "Hierdie man was te lank!", "Hy het 'n baie lang handvatsel vir sy skoffel gemaak.", "Hy het 'n baie ho\u00eb deurraam gemaak.", "Hy het 'n baie lang bed gemaak.", "Hy het 'n baie groot fiets gekoop.", "Hy het op 'n baie ho\u00eb stoel gesit. \n\nHy het met 'n baie lang vurk ge\u00ebet.", "Hy het sy huis verlaat en in 'n groot woud gaan woon. \n\nHy het nog lank en gelukkig gewoon."], "isiZulu": ["UGobani kwakuyindoda ende ngokwedlulele.
