I don't think you will get a chance to wear the raincoat today.'Mamma said.", "Wednesday again was a very hot sunny day.Mannu was getting worried, 'Mamma, why is it not raining yet?'He tried to put the raincoat on at home.

Mannu was eager to show off the raincoat to his school buddies.'Mamma, shall I carry the raincoat to the picnic. What if it rains there?' Mannu asked.'Don't, my pet. It will not rain today. See those white clouds? And they are also so far away.' Mamma tried to comfort him.", "And... at last\u00a0 on Friday, the sky looked quite dark with black clouds. Mannu kept the raincoat ready at hand.'Mamma, it will rain today, right mamma?' Mannu asked excitedly. The peacock also seemed to think so and started dancing. The tortoise came out of it's hiding and looked up at the sky hoping perhaps to feel cooler after the hot summer.'I think so. Today the sky is full of black clouds.' Mamma smiled at Mannu's excitement and was happy for him.", "On the Saturday morning there was a loud thunder.\u00a0 And also lightening.'Mamma, it that not lightening?

Simbegwire ran to her father. She stopped still when she saw that he was holding a woman's hand. \"I want you to meet someone special,  my child. This is Anita,\" he said smiling.", "\"Hello Simbegwire,  your father told me a lot about you,\" said Anita. But she did not smile or take the girl's hand. Simbegwire's father was happy and excited. He talked about the three of them living together,  and how good their life would be. \"My child,  I hope you will accept Anita as your mother,\" he said.", "Simbegwire's life changed. She no longer had time to sit with her father in the mornings. Anita gave her so many household chores that she was too tired to do her school work in the evenings.

Anita did not say anything. She was not happy either.", "Things got worse for Simbegwire. If she didn't finish her chores,  or she complained,  Anita hit her.

She followed the road her father had taken.", "When it came to evening,  she climbed a tall tree near a stream and made a bed for herself in the branches. As she went to sleep,  she sang: Maama,  maama,  maama,  you left me. You left me and never came back. Father doesn't love me anymore. Mother,  when are you coming back? You left me.", "The next morning,  Simbegwire sang the song again. When the women came to wash their clothes at the stream,  they heard the sad song coming from the tall tree. They thought it was only the wind rustling the leaves,  and carried on with their work. But one of the women listened very carefully to the song.", "This woman looked up into the tree. When she saw the girl and the pieces of colourful blanket,  she cried,  \"Simbegwire,  my brother's child!\" The other women stopped washing and helped Simbegwire to climb down from the tree. Her aunt hugged the little girl and tried to comfort her.", "Simbegwire's aunt took the child to her own house. She gave Simbegwire warm food,  and tucked her in bed with her mother's blanket. That night,  Simbegwire cried as she went to sleep. But they were tears of relief.

She was scared he might be angry,  so she ran inside the house to hide. But her father went to her and said,  \"Simbegwire,  you have found a perfect mother for yourself. One who loves you and understands you. I am proud of you and I love you.\" They agreed that Simbegwire would stay with her aunt as long as she wanted to.", "Her father visited her every day. Eventually,  he came with Anita.

Then she stepped forward slowly and put her arms around Anita.", "The next week,  Anita invited Simbegwire,  with her cousins and aunt,  to the house for a meal. What a feast! Anita prepared all of Simbegwire's favourite foods,  and everyone ate until they were full. Then the children played while the adults talked. Simbegwire felt happy and brave.

They had two children,  Mukhwana and Namono. There was a famine in the land where they lived. All the villagers,  including Mulongo and his family,  would leave their homes early to look for food in the forest.", "One day,  Mulongo,  his wife and children decided to go deep in the forest in search of something to eat. From morning to evening they looked for food but they found nothing. Nambuya urged her husband to go further into the forest. Mulongo led the way as Nambuya and the two children followed.", "Suddenly Mulongo saw a beautiful banana plantation. He called his wife and said,  \"Is that not a banana plantation? I can see bananas and other food crops. I wonder whose it is.\" They moved on and soon saw a house in the middle of the plantation. They stopped,  looked in all directions,  but there was no one around. Because they were hungry and it was nearly night time,  they decided to sit and wait for the owner.", "Suddenly they heard heavy breathing close to the house. They were frightened to see a huge ogre arrive. \"Who are you and what do you want?\" asked the ogre in a fearful voice. Mulongo in a trembling voice said,  \"We came looking for food because there is famine in our place.\" The ogre gave them food.", "For several days the ogre allowed Mulongo and his family to eat his crops without asking for anything in return. One morning,  however,  the ogre said to Nambuya,  \"I want you to cook your son for me to eat when I come back this evening.\" When the ogre had gone Mulongo went into the bush and killed some small animals,  which he asked his wife to cook for the ogre. Meanwhile he asked Mukhwana to climb up a leafy mango tree and hide.", "In the evening the ogre returned and asked,  \"Have you cooked Mukhwana for me?\" Mulongo's wife answered,  \"Yes.\" She gave the ogre the meat and he greedily ate everything. Then he said,  \"Tomorrow you cook your daughter.\"", "The following morning Mulongo and his wife did as they had done on the first day. Namono was hidden up the mango tree. When the ogre returned he said,  \"Did you cook Namono?\" Again,  Nambuya told the ogre that she had done so.", "After eating,  the ogre instructed Nambuya to cook her husband Mulongo,  the next day. Nambuya was perturbed but Mulongo said he would go out again and catch some animals to cook. He did that and after giving the meat to his wife,  he also climbed up the mango tree to hide.", "At dusk the ogre came back. Nambuya gave the meat to the ogre who enjoyed it very much. He told Nambuya,  \"Tomorrow cook yourself.\" When the ogre had left Nambuya called her husband to advise her. Mulongo said,  \"Go and look for some small animals and cook them for the ogre. When everything is ready,  come up the tree where we are.\"", "The ogre came back in the afternoon and started eating his tasty evening meal of sweet meat. He felt sleepy,  went to lie under the mango tree and began snoring. But not so long after,  the ogre woke up because he heard noises above him. The ogre looked up to the tree and saw Mulongo and his wife and children.", "The ogre was very angry. \"So you deceived me? Let me come and get you,\" he shouted. As the ogre was struggling to climb up the tree,  Mulongo quickly thought of a trick and said,  \"It will be easier for you to reach us if you tie a rope around your neck and we help to pull you up.\"", "The ogre ran into the house,  brought a strong rope and after tying it around his neck he threw the other end of the rope to Mulongo. Mulongo and his wife and children started pulling the ogre up as they twisted the rope. The rope soon tightened around the ogre's neck until he could not breathe and died.
