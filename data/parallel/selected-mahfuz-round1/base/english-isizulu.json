How many cabbages were left over?\" she asks the children.", "The next job is to write the price on each box and then help Baba K load the boxes on his truck.

Chipego's father sells the milk.\n\nA cow needs food and water, and time to graze in the field. So each day after school, Chipego helps with this work.

You will find that Pendo eats nearly 60 carrots a week. Can you tell exactly how many?", "After that, Chipego takes Pendo to graze in the fields. His father warned him to watch the time and give Pendo not  more than three quarters of an hour to graze.\n\nPendo usually starts grazing at about14:15 hrs, so that Chipego can take her back to the milking shed at 15 hours. In winter when it gets dark earlier, Chipego may start grazing earlier, around 13:30 hrs.", "Next Chipego gives Pendo water. Without water Pendo won't produce milk, no matter how much Chipego feeds her. Chipego fetches buckets of water from the village pump because there isn't one nearby.\n\nPendo's trough holds about 30 litres of water. Chipego's bucket only holds 5 litres. So to fill the trough Chipego has to make many trips. Can you work out how many trips he has to make?", "Then, Chipego takes Pendo to his father to get her daily 12 kg bag of grain. Chipego calculates that's almost 90 kg a week.\n\nEach bag costs K39.00. Chipego works out the cost of grain for each week. First he works out the cost of 7 bags at K40.00, which makes K280.00 Then he subtracts K7.00 to get K273.00 \"That's over K1 000 a month!\" Chipego estimates. Is he correct?", "Chipego's father milks Pendo twice a day. She produces about 24 litres of milk a day, so about 12 litres for each milking.\n\nSometimes Chipego helps with the milking but it is not as easy as it looks. \"One day,\" he thinks to himself, \"I will have my own cows and I will have to do all the milking myself.\"", "His father pours the milk from the big bucket into smaller two litre cans or one litre bottles. He then sells the milk for K8.00 a litre.\n\nOnce a week Chipego's father donates 25 litres of milk to Bulela School feeding scheme. Each child gets a quarter litre of this milk. That means that 100 children get milk on this day.", "For each litre of milk sold, his father gives Chipego 50 ngwee. That doesn't sound like a lot, but if his father sells 24 litres a day, it adds up to quite a bit. Can you tell how much?\n\nChipego saves his money until Saturday when he makes a trip to the book shop. Each book costs less than k10.00, so in a good week, he can buy quite a few.", "Chipego also loves to drink Pendo's milk. His father says that milk helps to build strong bones and teeth and makes a person fit and healthy.\n\nSo by drinking milk and eating lots of vegetables from his father's garden, Chipego is strong and healthy. He seldom gets sick and never goes hungry. His mother loves making mabisi using Pendo's milk too. His young sister enjoys adding the milk to her chibwantu! Hmmm! Yummy!", "Chipego never forgets to thank Pendo at the end of each day. He rewards her with extra carrots or spinach leaves that he finds lying around the garden.\n\n\"Thank you Pendo, you are my best friend! It is thanks to you that I am strong, healthy and clever. If not for you I would never be able to buy all the books that help me be top of my class.\" One day I will be a veterinary  doctor because of you!\nPendo is very lucky because Mutinta, Chipego's mother and Father also rewards her!

When they had laid them at the base of the tree,  one of them played a simple tune on the thumb piano.", "After a while,  the bird flew down to the ground to eat and drink. When she had finished,  she began to sing the most beautiful song. \u00a0 \n\nAt the same time,  she raised her dark,  shiny blue wings,  and within minutes,  the rain began to fall.", "This went on for many years. Because the rain fell regularly,  the crops grew abundantly and there was plenty of food in the village. \u00a0 \n\nBut gradually things began to change. Somehow,  the villagers were always busy and they began to neglect the rain bird. \n\"It will rain anyway,\" they said. \"It's time to stop spoiling that silly old bird!\"", "But the people were wrong. When they stopped looking after the bird,  the rain stopped falling. \n\nThe crops began to dry up and die,  and the animals grew thin and weak. Still,  nobody in the village went into the forest to feed the bird that brought the rain. Now they were all too busy trying to find money to buy food in the neighbouring town.", "One scorching day,  a young girl called Ketti decided to go into the forest after school. \"At least it will be cool in there,\" she thought. She walked and walked,  and after some time,  she came to the tall tree in which the rain bird lived. Ketti stared up at the tree. \n\nSuddenly,  she remembered how her granny had taken her into the forest to feed the bird when she was still a tiny child. Ketti opened her school bag and pulled out a piece of bread left over from her lunch. Carefully she laid the bread at the base of the tree. Then because she had no thumb piano, she sang an old song that she had known all her life.", "With a loud whooshing sound,  a beautiful blue bird swooped out of the branches above Ketti's head and began to eat the bread. When the bird had finished,  she opened her mouth and sang a few pure,  high notes. Then she raised her shiny wings and all of a sudden Ketti heard the rumble of thunder. By the time she reached her home,  giant rain drops were pelting down,  cooling the baking red earth.", "Ketti was very happy,  until she told her parents what had happened. \n\"Don't be silly!\" scolded her mother. \"Nobody believes that bird has anything to do with the rain anymore!\" \n\"Your mother is right,\" said Ketti's father. \"The drought has been broken now and we will be fine. Don't go wasting good bread feeding that greedy old bird again!\" \u00a0 \n\nThough Ketti didn't argue with her parents,  she felt sure they were wrong. \n\"If only Granny were still alive,\" she said to herself,  \"she would have believed me!\" \n\nBut Ketti's granny had died a few years earlier. The only thing Ketti had left,  was her granny's old thumb piano.", "Two weeks passed and there was no more rain. The crops began to shrivel up again and the hungry animals' ribs began to stick out even more. The sun beat down mercilessly from a glaring blue sky. \u00a0 \n\n\"I don't care what they say!\" thought Ketti. \"We need rain. I'm going to feed the bird again tomorrow!\"", "So,  early the next morning,  after taking a slice of bread and a handful of red berries from the kitchen,  Ketti slipped out of the house. She began to make her way to the centre of the forest. \u00a0 \n\nWhat she didn't realise,  was that her father was also awake. When he saw what his daughter was doing,  he realised that she was going to feed the rain bird again.", "\"I'll teach that  child a lesson!\" he said to himself angrily. He snatched his bow and arrows and silently followed Ketti into the forest. Just as the bird flew down to eat the food that Ketti had set out for it,  her father raised his bow and released his deadly arrow. The arrow flew straight into the bird's heart. The bird let out a piercing shriek. \n\nTerrified,  Ketti spun around \u2212 just in time to see her father fall down,  stone dead. Ketti screamed and turned around \u2212 just in time to see the arrow fall harmlessly from the bird's glossy body. \n\nThen the bird,  unharmed, swooped up into the highest branch of the tree.", "Ketti raced out of the forest to a scene of utter devastation. Every animal and every person she saw lay dead on the ground. With a pounding heart,  she ran all the way back to her home. \u00a0\n\nShe quickly found her granny's old thumb piano. \"This is my only hope!\" she thought. \"The rain bird is angry. I have to make her happy again! I HAVE to!\"", "Half an hour later,  Ketti was back at the base of the big tree. Her body was drenched with sweat and she was gasping for breath. A few paces away from her lay the lifeless body of her father. \n\nKetti looked away quickly,  and with trembling hands,  began to play the thumb piano. She played and played,  until her fingers hurt.", "Finally,  what she wanted most in the world happened. \n\nDown swooped the bird as if nothing had happened. The bird ate some of the berries still lying on the ground and sang a few notes. Then,  as Ketti played on,  the bird raised her wings. \n\nKetti heard a rustle behind her.", "It was her father who had woken up! \n\n\"I'm sorry!\" he said again and again to the big, blue bird. Then he held out his hand to his daughter and they walked slowly back to the village. \n\nIn the village all the people and animals were alive again.", "That night the villagers held a meeting.They all agreed that they had learned a valuable lesson. \n\nAnd from that day onwards,  not one week passed without a special trip to the forest to feed the bird that brought the rain."], "isiZulu": ["Ezweni elibizwa ngeGabon, kwakukhona umuzi owawakhiwe ekugcineni kwehlathi. \n\nPhakathi naleli hlathi, emagatsheni aphezulu esihlahleni esikhulu,  kwakuhlala inyoni yekhethelo \u2013 eyayikwazi ukunisa imvula.", "Kusukela kudala, abantu babegcina le nyoni ithokozile.

They are also part of our Polygon family.\u201d Vusi asked, \u201cDad, why we are called Polygons?\u201d \u201cWe are called polygons because we are 2-dimensional shapes. We are made of straight lines, and our shape is closed, as you can see, all our lines join up. Our cousins the Triangles, the Quadrilaterals, the Hexagons and the Pentagons will all be visiting,\u201d replied Dad.", "\u201cDid you say that is Octagon coming? Is she also our relative?\u201d asked Khosi. \u201cOf course my daughter, by just looking at her you can see she belongs to our family. You need to look carefully at the number of sides your cousins have, otherwise you might not be able to see the difference. Cousin Octagon has eight sides because her name starts with Octa,\u201d said Dad.", "\u201cOkay, what about Pentagon and Hexagon?\u201d asked Vusi. \u201cCousin Hexagon has six sides because his name starts with Hexa,\u201d replied Dad. \u201cPentagons have five sides. Our teacher told us that Penta means \u2018five\u2019,\u201d added Khosi. \u201cAnd remember that Tri means three and Quad means four. That\u2019s what makes your Triangle and Quadrilateral cousins look different,\u201d said Mom.", "\u201cDad, how many sides does Heptagon have?\u201d asked Vusi. Dad laughed and said, \u201cI am not going to tell you. Remember we took a photograph with them at your uncle's wedding. I want you to look at the photograph carefully and tell me what you observe.\u201d Vusi looked at the photograph and quickly answered, \u201cHeptagon has seven sides!\u201d Khosi added, \u201cYes, remember our teacher told us that Hepta means \u2018seven\u2019.\u201d", "\u201cOh my wife, can you see how clever our children are? Okay, what about Deca, what does it mean?\u201d questioned Dad. \u201cTen! Ten!\u201d shouted Vusi and Khosi together. \u201cYes, that's why one of your cousins is called Decagon, but he is not coming because he has to represent the swimming team. There are so few Decagons at their school,\u201d Mom told them.", "Then the children asked, \u201cMom and Dad, can we invite our friend Circle from next door?\u201d Their parents agreed that Circle was welcome to join the family gathering. Just then they heard a knock at the front door, and Dad got up to check. \u201cThe Quadrilaterals are here! Welcome! Welcome\u201d called Dad.", "The rest of the family jump up to greet Square, Rectangle and the three Rhombus children.

Her name is Nontsikelelo. She will be the mother of all blessings.", "Nontsikelelo was beautiful and strong with crinkling black button eyes. She loved her older brother, Mcengi. He made her laugh and so the laughter spread. She loved to eat meat before she had teeth. Her favourite aunt always kept a little portion on the side of her plate for Ntsiki. Mcengi chased the chickens that scratched in the garden where Ma Monikazi grew spinach and squash to feed her family. Ntsiki ran after him as her legs grew strong.\nMa Monikazi had another baby boy, Velaphi, and another, Qudalele. Finally another sister, Nomyaleko. Little Ntsiki folded napkins and washed the baby clothes. She swept the house and fed the fire.

As soon as Ntsiki was old enough, he hoisted her on to the saddle in front of him. His strong arms reached around her. He laced the reins through her fingers.He taught her to talk softly to Shishi, to groom her with a hard bristled brush. When she stroked its glossy coat, Albertina whispered, \u201cYou are the most beautiful creature. Thank you for letting me ride on your back.\u201d\nHer father, Bonilizwe, came home from the mines at Christmas. Ntsiki pulled herself up onto Shishi\u2019s broad back. She rode out to meet him at the bus stop. Ntsiki sat tall and straight. Her knees held firm. She handled the reins with gentle fingers.How proud Bonilizwe was of his daughter. The biggest smile Ntsiki had ever seen covered her father\u2019s face.", "", "On her sixth birthday she went to school. \u201cYou must choose an English name,\u201d said the Presbyterian teacher, but Ntsiki liked her own name. \u201cWhy do I need a new name?\u201d she asked. The teacher scowled and read the names aloud: \u201cAdah, Agnes, Albertina, Anna.\u201d What did they mean? Ntsiki liked the long name best. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had rhythm. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had bounce. Albertina was a name you didn\u2019t mess with.When her cousin married a handsome man from a nearby town, Albertina was chosen as an umkhapi. The maid of honour! Weeks before the wedding, she stitched her isikhakha, the short traditional skirt, and threaded bright beads onto her amatikiti. Her mother gave her the white flag and said, \u201cYou have a big job, my blessing.\u201dAt the bend in the road Albertina waved the flag, then turned Shishi back, leading everybody from miles around to the ceremony. People would gossip if she made a mistake, but the guests lined the road. They ululated and sang. They threw down flowers for the horse and the girl.", "", "Her mother was often sick and needed Albertina to look after the home.

You\u2019ll win it, for sure.\u201d", "Albertina studied until the candle burned down. She practised sums. She practised spelling. She sharpened her pencils and gave her shoes an extra shine. Next morning she passed Shishi in her paddock. The horse whinnied and stamped the ground.\n\nThe test began. Albertina\u2019s fingers shook. The sums were tricky. Her mouth went dry. Her hand cramped on her pencil but she continued. \u201cWell done, Albertina!\u201d said her teacher at the end. The important official arrived and called the top two students to the stage. \u201cWell done to Albertina for full marks,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you are too old. The scholarship goes to\u2026\u201dAlbertina tried not to cry. \u201cThat\u2019s unfair,\u201d shouted Betty, hopping with fury. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t in the rules!\u201d How would Albertina go to high school now? She dragged her feet all the way home.The teacher wrote to the newspaper about the unfair decision. Brother Joe at the Catholic Mission station read the story over his breakfast.

Their home girl was off to high school. She would make them proud. They threw a party like no other. The women brewed the sorghum beer and lit the fires. They slaughtered chickens and stirred up pots of meat. Albertina smiled till her face ached.She packed her brown suitcase and polished her shoes again. Before setting off on the bus to Matatiele, she said goodbye to Shishi. Albertina brushed her coat and stroked her wiry mane. She whispered all her questions into the horse\u2019s silky ear: What if I get lost? Will I make new friends? Will I still be clever so far from home? Shishi whinnied and stamped the ground.", "", "School days started well before sunrise. The girls washed quickly in the cold water and swept the dormitories before Mass. The milky porridge was never quite enough; the stew not as tasty as Aunty\u2019s back home. But Albertina studied hard. She played netball on sunny afternoons.In her school holidays Albertina worked at the mission station. She rubbed and scrubbed against the zinc washboard. She boiled sheets in copper tubs, then wound them through the wringer. She hoed and tilled the school garden but missed her family. Who was telling her brothers and sisters funny stories? Who wiped their eyes when they cried? Who tickled them until they laughed?Albertina loved the nuns who taught her. Could she become a holy sister? \u201cBut nuns earn no salary,\u201d said Father Bernard. \u201cPerhaps you should become a nurse? You\u2019ll be paid while you study.\u201d", "", "Albertina took a train to Johannesburg. She bought a smart white uniform, new navy shoes and a shiny red fountain pen.

Winter\u2019s not long. Be brave, little one. Together we\u2019re strong!Some nights Albertina worked till dawn. She looked out the window and thought of her family. Were the children hungry? Did they go to school? Who was riding Shishi? She remembered the dark green spinach. She missed the scent of the earth. There was no vegetable garden here. There was nowhere for a horse.Albertina never went to parties. She saved every shilling. On her days off she learned to play tennis. Whoosh! Plop! She whacked the ball across the net. Always, she wished for a little more money to send home.", "", "Walter Sisulu was a brave and clever man who dreamed of freedom for South Africa. His big smile captured Albertina\u2019s eye. They walked together down the city streets. Her delicate hand rested on his arm. Walter wanted Albertina to be the mother of his children.Bright ribbons decorated the Bantu Men\u2019s Social Centre on their wedding day. Albertina\u2019s long-sleeved dress had a swirling train of lace. Many friends blessed their special day. Albertina planted flowers in her little garden. Within a year, Max was born. Albertina had become a mother. One day people would call her the mother of the nation.Max had his mother\u2019s black button eyes and his father\u2019s round chin. He was the hope for their future.

He was jailed on Robben Island for 26 years. Albertina, also, was sent to jail many times. Often she was scared. Often she was lonely.But even on the darkest nights, she could see a sliver of moon through the window in her cell.
