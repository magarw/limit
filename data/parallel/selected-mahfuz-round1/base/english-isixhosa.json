Chipego lives with his father, mother and his  little sister Mutinta.  There is one more special member of the family, Pendo the cow. \nChipego helps his father to look after Pendo in exchange for pocket money that he uses to buy books. \nMeet Chipego. He is 10 years old and in Grade 5 at the village school. Chipego always comes top of his class. \"What's his secret?\" his schoolmates ask themselves.\n\n\"He's excellent in reading and writing. How does he do it?\" they wonder. Chipego tells them it is because he reads lots of books. While they waste their time doing nothing, he spends all his free time reading.", "Chipego sometimes earns K80.00 a week in pocket money. He spends most of the pocket money on books at the second-hand book shop in his village.\n\nSo how does Chipego earn enough pocket money for these books? Read on to find out.", "Meet Pendo, the family's milking cow. She produces over 20 litres of milk per day. Chipego's father sells the milk.\n\nA cow needs food and water, and time to graze in the field. So each day after school, Chipego helps with this work. Chipego's father gives him pocket money for the work he does. And it is this money that Chipego saves to buy books each week.", "First, Chipego gives Pendo a bunch of carrots. He gives her exactly eight carrots a day. Each day he picks the carrots from his father's vegetable garden, enough for a day at a time.\n\nYou can work it out. You will find that Pendo eats nearly 60 carrots a week. Can you tell exactly how many?", "After that, Chipego takes Pendo to graze in the fields. His father warned him to watch the time and give Pendo not  more than three quarters of an hour to graze.\n\nPendo usually starts grazing at about14:15 hrs, so that Chipego can take her back to the milking shed at 15 hours. In winter when it gets dark earlier, Chipego may start grazing earlier, around 13:30 hrs.", "Next Chipego gives Pendo water. Without water Pendo won't produce milk, no matter how much Chipego feeds her. Chipego fetches buckets of water from the village pump because there isn't one nearby.\n\nPendo's trough holds about 30 litres of water. Chipego's bucket only holds 5 litres. So to fill the trough Chipego has to make many trips. Can you work out how many trips he has to make?", "Then, Chipego takes Pendo to his father to get her daily 12 kg bag of grain. Chipego calculates that's almost 90 kg a week.\n\nEach bag costs K39.00. Chipego works out the cost of grain for each week. First he works out the cost of 7 bags at K40.00, which makes K280.00 Then he subtracts K7.00 to get K273.00 \"That's over K1 000 a month!\" Chipego estimates. Is he correct?", "Chipego's father milks Pendo twice a day.

When they had laid them at the base of the tree,  one of them played a simple tune on the thumb piano.", "After a while,  the bird flew down to the ground to eat and drink. When she had finished,  she began to sing the most beautiful song. \u00a0 \n\nAt the same time,  she raised her dark,  shiny blue wings,  and within minutes,  the rain began to fall.", "This went on for many years. Because the rain fell regularly,  the crops grew abundantly and there was plenty of food in the village. \u00a0 \n\nBut gradually things began to change. Somehow,  the villagers were always busy and they began to neglect the rain bird. \n\"It will rain anyway,\" they said. \"It's time to stop spoiling that silly old bird!\"", "But the people were wrong. When they stopped looking after the bird,  the rain stopped falling. \n\nThe crops began to dry up and die,  and the animals grew thin and weak. Still,  nobody in the village went into the forest to feed the bird that brought the rain. Now they were all too busy trying to find money to buy food in the neighbouring town.", "One scorching day,  a young girl called Ketti decided to go into the forest after school. \"At least it will be cool in there,\" she thought. She walked and walked,  and after some time,  she came to the tall tree in which the rain bird lived. Ketti stared up at the tree. \n\nSuddenly,  she remembered how her granny had taken her into the forest to feed the bird when she was still a tiny child. Ketti opened her school bag and pulled out a piece of bread left over from her lunch. Carefully she laid the bread at the base of the tree. Then because she had no thumb piano, she sang an old song that she had known all her life.", "With a loud whooshing sound,  a beautiful blue bird swooped out of the branches above Ketti's head and began to eat the bread. When the bird had finished,  she opened her mouth and sang a few pure,  high notes. Then she raised her shiny wings and all of a sudden Ketti heard the rumble of thunder. By the time she reached her home,  giant rain drops were pelting down,  cooling the baking red earth.", "Ketti was very happy,  until she told her parents what had happened. \n\"Don't be silly!\" scolded her mother. \"Nobody believes that bird has anything to do with the rain anymore!\" \n\"Your mother is right,\" said Ketti's father. \"The drought has been broken now and we will be fine. Don't go wasting good bread feeding that greedy old bird again!\" \u00a0 \n\nThough Ketti didn't argue with her parents,  she felt sure they were wrong. \n\"If only Granny were still alive,\" she said to herself,  \"she would have believed me!\" \n\nBut Ketti's granny had died a few years earlier. The only thing Ketti had left,  was her granny's old thumb piano.", "Two weeks passed and there was no more rain. The crops began to shrivel up again and the hungry animals' ribs began to stick out even more. The sun beat down mercilessly from a glaring blue sky. \u00a0 \n\n\"I don't care what they say!\" thought Ketti. \"We need rain. I'm going to feed the bird again tomorrow!\"", "So,  early the next morning,  after taking a slice of bread and a handful of red berries from the kitchen,  Ketti slipped out of the house. She began to make her way to the centre of the forest. \u00a0 \n\nWhat she didn't realise,  was that her father was also awake. When he saw what his daughter was doing,  he realised that she was going to feed the rain bird again.", "\"I'll teach that  child a lesson!\" he said to himself angrily. He snatched his bow and arrows and silently followed Ketti into the forest. Just as the bird flew down to eat the food that Ketti had set out for it,  her father raised his bow and released his deadly arrow. The arrow flew straight into the bird's heart. The bird let out a piercing shriek. \n\nTerrified,  Ketti spun around \u2212 just in time to see her father fall down,  stone dead. Ketti screamed and turned around \u2212 just in time to see the arrow fall harmlessly from the bird's glossy body. \n\nThen the bird,  unharmed, swooped up into the highest branch of the tree.", "Ketti raced out of the forest to a scene of utter devastation. Every animal and every person she saw lay dead on the ground. With a pounding heart,  she ran all the way back to her home. \u00a0\n\nShe quickly found her granny's old thumb piano. \"This is my only hope!\" she thought. \"The rain bird is angry. I have to make her happy again! I HAVE to!\"", "Half an hour later,  Ketti was back at the base of the big tree. Her body was drenched with sweat and she was gasping for breath. A few paces away from her lay the lifeless body of her father. \n\nKetti looked away quickly,  and with trembling hands,  began to play the thumb piano. She played and played,  until her fingers hurt.", "Finally,  what she wanted most in the world happened. \n\nDown swooped the bird as if nothing had happened. The bird ate some of the berries still lying on the ground and sang a few notes. Then,  as Ketti played on,  the bird raised her wings. \n\nKetti heard a rustle behind her.", "It was her father who had woken up! \n\n\"I'm sorry!\" he said again and again to the big, blue bird. Then he held out his hand to his daughter and they walked slowly back to the village. \n\nIn the village all the people and animals were alive again.", "That night the villagers held a meeting.They all agreed that they had learned a valuable lesson. \n\nAnd from that day onwards,  not one week passed without a special trip to the forest to feed the bird that brought the rain."], "isiXhosa": ["Kwilizwe laseGabon, kwakukh' ilali encinane eyayimi kwinyele lehlathi. \n\nEsizikithini seli hlathi, kwawona masebe aphezulu omthi omkhulu kunene, kwakuhlala eyona ntaka\nikhethekileyo \u2013 intaka eyenza imvula.", "Kuko konke okwakudala okusakhunjulwayo\nngabahlali bale lali, babethe gqolo bezinika ithuba lokugcina le ntaka yonwabile maxesha onke. \n\nBabegcina ingququ yesonka, amaqhekeza eziqhamo kunye nobisi olutsha lwekhokhonathi, kwaye rhoqo ngeveki okanye ngeeveki ezimbini, iqela labahlali bale lali bebethatha ezi zimuncumuncu bazise ehlathini. \n\nBayakuthi ke emva kokuba bezandlele phantsi kwalo mthi, aze omnye adlale ngonyana ithile ngepiyano edlalwa ngeminwe.", "Kuya kuthi ethubeni, ubone loo ntaka ibhabha isiza ezantsi ukuza kutya ize isele kananjalo.

Mcengi chased the chickens that scratched in the garden where Ma Monikazi grew spinach and squash to feed her family. Ntsiki ran after him as her legs grew strong.\nMa Monikazi had another baby boy, Velaphi, and another, Qudalele. Finally another sister, Nomyaleko.

He laced the reins through her fingers.He taught her to talk softly to Shishi, to groom her with a hard bristled brush. When she stroked its glossy coat, Albertina whispered, \u201cYou are the most beautiful creature. Thank you for letting me ride on your back.\u201d\nHer father, Bonilizwe, came home from the mines at Christmas. Ntsiki pulled herself up onto Shishi\u2019s broad back.

The biggest smile Ntsiki had ever seen covered her father\u2019s face.", "", "On her sixth birthday she went to school. \u201cYou must choose an English name,\u201d said the Presbyterian teacher, but Ntsiki liked her own name. \u201cWhy do I need a new name?\u201d she asked. The teacher scowled and read the names aloud: \u201cAdah, Agnes, Albertina, Anna.\u201d What did they mean? Ntsiki liked the long name best. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had rhythm. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had bounce. Albertina was a name you didn\u2019t mess with.When her cousin married a handsome man from a nearby town, Albertina was chosen as an umkhapi. The maid of honour! Weeks before the wedding, she stitched her isikhakha, the short traditional skirt, and threaded bright beads onto her amatikiti. Her mother gave her the white flag and said, \u201cYou have a big job, my blessing.\u201dAt the bend in the road Albertina waved the flag, then turned Shishi back, leading everybody from miles around to the ceremony. People would gossip if she made a mistake, but the guests lined the road. They ululated and sang. They threw down flowers for the horse and the girl.", "", "Her mother was often sick and needed Albertina to look after the home.

You\u2019ll win it, for sure.\u201d", "Albertina studied until the candle burned down. She practised sums. She practised spelling. She sharpened her pencils and gave her shoes an extra shine. Next morning she passed Shishi in her paddock. The horse whinnied and stamped the ground.\n\nThe test began. Albertina\u2019s fingers shook. The sums were tricky. Her mouth went dry. Her hand cramped on her pencil but she continued. \u201cWell done, Albertina!\u201d said her teacher at the end. The important official arrived and called the top two students to the stage. \u201cWell done to Albertina for full marks,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you are too old.

She dragged her feet all the way home.The teacher wrote to the newspaper about the unfair decision. Brother Joe at the Catholic Mission station read the story over his breakfast.

He didn\u2019t like the story one bit either.", "", "Soon enough there was a scholarship for Albertina. Mariazell near Matatiele was a long way from Xolobe, but the whole village erupted. Their home girl was off to high school. She would make them proud. They threw a party like no other. The women brewed the sorghum beer and lit the fires. They slaughtered chickens and stirred up pots of meat. Albertina smiled till her face ached.She packed her brown suitcase and polished her shoes again. Before setting off on the bus to Matatiele, she said goodbye to Shishi. Albertina brushed her coat and stroked her wiry mane. She whispered all her questions into the horse\u2019s silky ear: What if I get lost? Will I make new friends? Will I still be clever so far from home? Shishi whinnied and stamped the ground.", "", "School days started well before sunrise. The girls washed quickly in the cold water and swept the dormitories before Mass. The milky porridge was never quite enough; the stew not as tasty as Aunty\u2019s back home. But Albertina studied hard. She played netball on sunny afternoons.In her school holidays Albertina worked at the mission station. She rubbed and scrubbed against the zinc washboard. She boiled sheets in copper tubs, then wound them through the wringer. She hoed and tilled the school garden but missed her family. Who was telling her brothers and sisters funny stories? Who wiped their eyes when they cried? Who tickled them until they laughed?Albertina loved the nuns who taught her. Could she become a holy sister? \u201cBut nuns earn no salary,\u201d said Father Bernard. \u201cPerhaps you should become a nurse? You\u2019ll be paid while you study.\u201d", "", "Albertina took a train to Johannesburg. She bought a smart white uniform, new navy shoes and a shiny red fountain pen. Sick people came all day to the hospital. She cleaned their wounds with careful fingers. She held the old people gently. When the babies cried, she sang: \u201cBe strong, little one.
