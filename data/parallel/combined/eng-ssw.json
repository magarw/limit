Chipego lives with his father, mother and his  little sister Mutinta.  There is one more special member of the family, Pendo the cow. \nChipego helps his father to look after Pendo in exchange for pocket money that he uses to buy books. \nMeet Chipego. He is 10 years old and in Grade 5 at the village school. Chipego always comes top of his class. \"What's his secret?\" his schoolmates ask themselves.\n\n\"He's excellent in reading and writing. How does he do it?\" they wonder. Chipego tells them it is because he reads lots of books. While they waste their time doing nothing, he spends all his free time reading.", "Chipego sometimes earns K80.00 a week in pocket money. He spends most of the pocket money on books at the second-hand book shop in his village.\n\nSo how does Chipego earn enough pocket money for these books? Read on to find out.", "Meet Pendo, the family's milking cow. She produces over 20 litres of milk per day. Chipego's father sells the milk.\n\nA cow needs food and water, and time to graze in the field. So each day after school, Chipego helps with this work. Chipego's father gives him pocket money for the work he does. And it is this money that Chipego saves to buy books each week.", "First, Chipego gives Pendo a bunch of carrots. He gives her exactly eight carrots a day. Each day he picks the carrots from his father's vegetable garden, enough for a day at a time.\n\nYou can work it out. You will find that Pendo eats nearly 60 carrots a week. Can you tell exactly how many?", "After that, Chipego takes Pendo to graze in the fields. His father warned him to watch the time and give Pendo not  more than three quarters of an hour to graze.\n\nPendo usually starts grazing at about14:15 hrs, so that Chipego can take her back to the milking shed at 15 hours. In winter when it gets dark earlier, Chipego may start grazing earlier, around 13:30 hrs.", "Next Chipego gives Pendo water. Without water Pendo won't produce milk, no matter how much Chipego feeds her. Chipego fetches buckets of water from the village pump because there isn't one nearby.\n\nPendo's trough holds about 30 litres of water. Chipego's bucket only holds 5 litres. So to fill the trough Chipego has to make many trips. Can you work out how many trips he has to make?", "Then, Chipego takes Pendo to his father to get her daily 12 kg bag of grain. Chipego calculates that's almost 90 kg a week.\n\nEach bag costs K39.00. Chipego works out the cost of grain for each week. First he works out the cost of 7 bags at K40.00, which makes K280.00 Then he subtracts K7.00 to get K273.00 \"That's over K1 000 a month!\" Chipego estimates. Is he correct?", "Chipego's father milks Pendo twice a day. She produces about 24 litres of milk a day, so about 12 litres for each milking.\n\nSometimes Chipego helps with the milking but it is not as easy as it looks. \"One day,\" he thinks to himself, \"I will have my own cows and I will have to do all the milking myself.\"", "His father pours the milk from the big bucket into smaller two litre cans or one litre bottles. He then sells the milk for K8.00 a litre.\n\nOnce a week Chipego's father donates 25 litres of milk to Bulela School feeding scheme. Each child gets a quarter litre of this milk. That means that 100 children get milk on this day.", "For each litre of milk sold, his father gives Chipego 50 ngwee. That doesn't sound like a lot, but if his father sells 24 litres a day, it adds up to quite a bit. Can you tell how much?\n\nChipego saves his money until Saturday when he makes a trip to the book shop. Each book costs less than k10.00, so in a good week, he can buy quite a few.", "Chipego also loves to drink Pendo's milk. His father says that milk helps to build strong bones and teeth and makes a person fit and healthy.\n\nSo by drinking milk and eating lots of vegetables from his father's garden, Chipego is strong and healthy. He seldom gets sick and never goes hungry. His mother loves making mabisi using Pendo's milk too. His young sister enjoys adding the milk to her chibwantu! Hmmm! Yummy!", "Chipego never forgets to thank Pendo at the end of each day. He rewards her with extra carrots or spinach leaves that he finds lying around the garden.\n\n\"Thank you Pendo, you are my best friend! It is thanks to you that I am strong, healthy and clever. If not for you I would never be able to buy all the books that help me be top of my class.\" One day I will be a veterinary  doctor because of you!\nPendo is very lucky because Mutinta, Chipego's mother and Father also rewards her!

Nomsa,  Jabu and Zodwa have just sat down in the shade to enjoy their lunch. Today Nomsa and Zodwa brought food from home,  but Jabu is eating a kota from Mr Mkhize's shop.", "\"Mmmm,  this cheese is creamy! Mr Mkhize's kotas are the best!\" exclaims Jabu licking his fingers. Tebogo is sitting nearby and overhears Jabu. He can't believe his ears! Tebogo asks,  \"Did you just say there's cheese on Mkhize's kota? Did you say Mkhize's kotas are the best? Are you joking?\"", "\"Haa! You don't know Mr Mkhize! He's changed his ways and this kota speaks for itself,\" says Jabu pointing at his kota. The kota is stuffed with chips,  polony and atchar,  and covered in creamy melting cheese. Tebogo is impressed,  \"It's true,  and the bread is really packed with filling!\" Just then Scelo arrives with his lunch and Tebogo says to his friend,  \"Hey Scelo,  look at this kota!\"", "Jabu notices Scelo's face and asks,  \"Why you are looking so serious!\"\u00a0 Scelo puts his kota on the bench next to Jabu's kota. \"I got my kota from Mr Motaung. The kotas are equal in size,  but mine has less filling!\" \"Yes,\" says Nomsa,  \"that's exactly why so many kids are buying from Mr Mkhize's shop now.\"", "\"So Mr Mkhize is a changed man? He used to slice one loaf of bread into five parts to make his kotas!\" says Tebogo. \"Ah!\" replies Nomsa,  \"that was not a kota at all!\" \n\n\"Why was it not a kota?\" asks Scelo.", "\"Ha Scelo!\" laughs Nomsa. \"Don't you remember what our teacher taught us about fractions? Cutting one loaf of bread into five equal pieces does not give us quarters. It gives us fifths.\"\u00a0 Scelo thinks,  then he says,  \"I remember! Each part of a whole divided into 5 equal parts is \u2155 of the whole. Each part of a whole divided into 4 equal pieces is \u00bc of the whole.\"", "Zodwa interrupts,  \"But hey guys,  what is going on with Mr Motaung's kota's? They're a quarter of a loaf,  but they contain less than Mr Mkhize's kotas.\" Jabu frowns and says to the group,  \"If Motaung is having problems and goes out of business,  then Mkhize will have no competition. What if Mkhize gets greedy and goes back to his bad old ways?\"", "A few days later,  Mr Motaung is getting ready to sell lunch at break time. He's worried. Lately,  fewer and fewer learners are buying from him. Mr Motaung asks himself,  \"Why are they all flocking to Mkhize? What is it that he's doing that I'm not? I thought we were selling the same kota at the same price.\"", "Jabu on his way from Mr Mkhize's shop passes by Mr Motaung's shop. He calls the boy over,  \"Hey Jabu,  how are you? I've not seen you for some time.\"\u00a0 Mr Motaung's eyes are not on Jabu but the kota Jabu is carrying! He realises that the kota has got more chips,  more cheese,  more polony and more atchar!

Soon I'll be selling fruit at my shop. Here are some sweet juicy apples to try for free. Please share with your friends.\"", "The girls are delighted. \"Thank you Mr Mkhize!\" they say at the same time.

He wants to sell them at his shop.\"\u00a0Nomsa puts the apples on the bench so that they can all count them. \"Well,\" says Tebogo,  \"we can each have an equal number of apples. But there's one apple left over.\"", "\"Let's cut that remaining apple into three equal parts,\" suggests Jabu. \"What are those equal parts called?\" mutters Nomsa to herself. \"Thirds! Cut the apple into thirds! Three equal parts,\" says Scelo proudly.", "\"No,  let's give that leftover apple to our maths teacher!\" says Zodwa. The friends agree that it's a good suggestion to give the apple to Ms Nkosi after break.", "The next week,  Jabu and Nomsa are waiting for Zodwa at break. Zodwa arrives with her kota. \"Look,  Motaung is back in business!\" she says. Zodwa puts her kota on the bench and the three of them compare the kotas. \"Wow!\" says Jabu,  \"that kota is bigger than a quarter! And look at all those chips!\" \n\n\"I bet this cost a lot extra? How does Mr Motaung make a profit?\" asks Nomsa suspiciously.", "After break,  as they head back to class,  Zodwa takes her friends to read the notice board outside Mr Motaung's shop.
