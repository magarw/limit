This is Matende.
Huyu ni Matende.
Matende cries all the time.
Matende hulia kila wakati.
When his mother feeds him, Matende cries.
Mamake anapomlisha, Matende analia.
When Matende is put down to rest, he still cries.
Matende anapolazwa chini kupumzika, bado analia.
When his mother changes his nappies, Matende continues to cry.
Mamake anapobadilisha pampa, Matende anaendelea kulia.
When his mother carries him on her shoulder, Matende cries more.
Mamake anapombeba begani, Matende analia zaidi.
When he falls asleep, Matende looks as if he is about to cry.
Anapopatwa na usingizi, Matende anaonekana kuwa ataanza kulia.
Matende's mother looks at her son.
She does not know what is wrong with him.
Mamake Matende anamtazama mwanawe.
Hajui kinachomsumbua.
