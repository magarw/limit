# LIMIT: Language Identification, Misidentification, and Translation

# Note (Nov 8, 2023)
Since the anonymity period is over and the paper has been accepted to EMNLP 2023, we will be doing the following over the next couple of weeks:
1. Manually inspecting and sharing the dataset on HuggingFace so researchers can use it for their experiements.
2. Updating the repository with easy-to-run code to reproduce our experiments
3. Modularizing and generalizing our experiment code, so researchers can use our proposed confusion-based hierarchical approach for their datasets.
